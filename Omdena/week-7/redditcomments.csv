f351wxh,t3_dfpkxq,"This sounds nice and all. But why did it take you messaging them FIRST for THEM to apologise and admit their wrongs? They should have reached out to you first.

I know that this is probably not what you expect as an answer. Call me a cynic or whatever, but as someone who was mercilessly bullied myself, I am in the opinion that a proper apology can only be done before leaving school, not years after. Otherwise I do not feel it is genuine and that they just want to make themselves feel better.

It is up to you of course whether you accept the apology. But you are in absolutely no way shape or form obligated to be their friend or accept them into your life just to make them feel better. Remember - YOU and your mental health come first and foremost not them.

I‚Äôm sorry for my English or weird kind of explaining it‚Äôs not my natal language 
  This is either an entitled child story or a bullying one , maybe both so I‚Äôm sorry if this ain‚Äôt what you‚Äôre looking for 

Backstory

When I was in middle school I was a quiet kid and I used to wear a black hoody all the time because it was the most comfortable thing ever . Also I had short boy-ish hair and as female that was very easy to laugh at so I was getting mocked a lot . I had a great group of friends though and they helped me through it 


Story 
  
It was a normal class and I remember having my hoody and hood on , looking down and writing whatever it was I had to write . One of the class bullies notices I‚Äôm having my hood on and starts laughing about me being possessed or some weird shiz and I get pretty angry but don‚Äôt do anything and continue writing . At this point I think I was just randomly squiggling on my copybook so I didn‚Äôt have to mess with them . 
   Now this is where it gets interesting .. the bullies continue their mockery and I take my hood off suddenly I feel a pain in my stomach and  right afterwards a very sharp pain in the neck , I can‚Äôt breath almost at all and I start kinda chocking and because of this the main bullies that torment me everyday start laughing. I start crying which makes breathing even harder . I don‚Äôt know how the teacher did not notice before my friends actually started shouting for her to help me but somebody took me to the school nurse and I was okay . I usually do not cry and just get over the insult and if there is any violence or phisycal abuse involved is jut go to the bathroom and put cold water on anything that hurt . Nobody got expelled or suspended or anything at all happened that would stop them from continuing this but something else that really had a major impact on me as a kid I don‚Äôt really remember.",t3_dfpkxq

I've learned through experience and in my classes the reality that there is *always* a reason a bully is a bully. I can't say too much but a boy I met during my time observing classrooms was acting as a bully to let out his anger at being taken from his parents. It's really very sad for everyone involved.

I'm very sorry about your son, knowing someone is being bullied is terrible, and knowing that bully is going through something is also terrible. I wish I could help every kid out there, but the reality is that I can't. No matter how much I wish I could, all I can do is try to make my future students know that I care.",t3_dfpkxq
f421lrs,t1_f3ysnya,"Not that it's super important, but I'm a girl. Anyways, she (the bully) shouldn't have a reason to lie about being abused. In the town we grew up in, abuse is a frighteningly common occurrence. I believe your mindset is still juvenile, and you have not had time to grow beyond the harsh memories (or even perhaps continued reality) of being bullied, and for that, I'm sorry.

I completed a practicum block fairly recently, I made excellent connections with many of the students. Had one situation where a student confided in me about being bullied, it's a really hard thing to know how to deal with as a (new) teacher. Like in many cases the student didn't want to admit to an authority figure what their situation was. In fear of being labelled as a ""snitch"". I feel this is a fundamental problem in addressing bullying in schools. There seems to be a massive disconnect between ""zero tolerance policies"" and the reality of student experiences.

I totally relate to your perspective that all you can do is try to let your students know that you care. I just wish there was a more tangible way of helping students understand that the reason the bully has so much power is because of the fear of admitting to teacher/authority figure.",t3_dfpkxq

'I told the chaplain I was being bullied. She called the teacher of the class I was being bullied in and she told the chaplain she ""hadn't seen any bullying"". So the chaplain told me I was making up being bullied to get out of class.  I then went to class and of course was bullied further. In fact I was bullied for three years at [my high school]. Not just at school but on the way home, after school and on weekends too because I was stalked. The bullies found out where I lived and came to my house to terrorize me and my family, as well as making threatening and abusive phone calls. But when I told the coordinator she said she couldn't do anything because it was happening outside of school.
Then in year 11 I reached out to the student welfare coordinator about the fact I was suffering from depression and, in front of my friend who was also a client of hers,  she told me I was self centred and couldn't see how much my friend was hurting, and that my friends problems were very serious. Made me feel like my problems meant nothing. I may also add this us a serious breach of client confidentiality to bring my friends issues up in front of me. therefore I stopped reaching out at your school. I am now suffering PTSD as a result and will NEVER EVER recommend  [My high school] to anyone else.
A few years after graduating I wrote to your school for closure about the whole thing. I got told there was nothing on my record about it. Well OF COURSE there wasn't. Your ""support"" staff didn't do their jobs properly and didn't take notes.
Also in the letter you sent back to me you told me all the support staff were fully qualified to do their jobs and they along with teachers receive regular training around bullying. I find this very hard to believe. If they were in fact receiving this training it was obviously not very effective.'

They then all mimicked me all the way to class. I then started crying and one of my pals took me away to the end of the corridor to comfort me. Then my mums best friend came along and helped me some more. (My mums best friend was the teaching assistant in my English class). When my mum took mento the head of year to demand they do something, we were told ""we dont really call that bullying"" so my mum moved me to a different school.

It isnt just school either I was bullied in college and in my first job. The first few years of my life were crap.

As I looked at those who hated on me and treated me like shit it looked like they were on the fast track.  In some cases they are and still are.  I know one of my bullies owns a popular resort in town for example.  

How ever I eventually learned that this doesn't define me and the only reason why it was effecting me so much was because I was holding onto it.  There are tons of people out there who do better and worse.  How ever what sets these individuals apart is what they did.  So you connect what they did with who they are and there lives.  Makes sense, how ever that's not you, you are you.  Its your life and what really defines you is what you do with it not what others try to make of it.  Its never healthy to compare yourself to others especially on the surface.  On the surface things can look perfect so people tend to compare only things they see even if they are in reality superficial.  

The important thing is to drop them, drop them, because they don't matter like any one else you don't know.  Live your life for sake to build your self up into a person you want to be some day.  That way no matter how much they ""have"" you will become the better person.",t3_eh8p7e
fd72419,t3_eh8p7e,"Karma does not exist. At least not in this life, maybe the next life if you believe in such things.

My dad cheated on my mom. Still happily married to the other woman.

My mom is the sweetest, most caring person in the whole universe. And I don't just say that because she is my mom, she truly is. It took years for her to get over the divorce, and right after she remarried, her husband passed. It's been years and she is still in so much pain.

My dad, on the other hand, is perfectly, extremely happy.

I was bullied all throughout school, and many of my bullies, from what I can tell, are extremely well adjusted and happy. I suffer from that trauma and have mental health problems and also severe physical health issues. I've never experienced happiness and doubt I ever will.

If you expect things to be fair, they won't ever be. If you expect this magical force called karma to go knocking down your enemies while rewarding you for your deeds, it won't. At least not in this life (which is the only one I'm concerned with). So what do you do? You keep living in this shit world anyway. There's always the possibility that things will get better for you, but don't ever expect life to punish your enemies.

&#x200B;

If you want karma to be real, call yourself karma and get even. This will likely only bring you tremendous suffering while it will probably not actually pay back your enemies for what you did. And if you do something illegal, that really will ruin your life and you'll be traumatized further, even if they did deserve it, you will be the one who pays. So I don't suggest getting even.

Don't worry about messing up because that is just part of learning and improving. And if you don't like it you can do other things that I find helpful like going on nature walks.

And in 90% of cases I've experienced, bullies are not used to someone standing up to them/retaliating, so you get the satisfaction of seeing them crumble like a mess and playing victim, and realise that you were stronger and better than their 'can-dish-it-out-like-crazy-but-can't-take-a-bit-of-it' pathetic selves.

Unfortunately what mostly happens is the bully harassing the victim in the way so only his friends can see that, but when victim tries to answer he doesn't think about that and most of the times from adult's perspective it looks like the victim is bullying the real bully.

In my opinion the solution for that would be to just better investigate such cases, but on the other side victims should never react to bullying in any aggressive way and should just report the behavior.

Lastly, it's never victim's fault that he got bullied, but it's his fault if he will deal with that in the wrong way. Many people are looking for revenge and that makes the bully harass even more people.",t3_i1pyor

fq88cpl,t3_gh8ur0,"I think the question should not be how do bullies know who to bully. That implies its something about the victim that is the cause.  Our culture has this very tough love attitude that is not mentally healthy.  Its something that needs to be pointed out as you are doing.  

  I think some bullies may have learned by abuse but it's no excuse.  What's wrong with the attitude that bullying is acceptable is it doesn't end the abusive chain.  Its scary that some don't see bullying as wrong.  Also people sometimes look at surface.  The pretty perfect boy or girl can be a bully but people assume they are not, while the misfit kid with the green hair isn't but is being bullied just for wanting to be who they want to be. 

Some people with the attidude bullying is ok think it's needed to make the people who want to be different to be the same.  But it doesnt really make change.  It creates pain. Some people need their own identity to be mentally healthy.",t3_gh8ur0
fq7u4cq,t3_gh8ur0,"Ya of course they are sadistic. Any person who is not anti-social will dislike such behavior even if it does not affect them because it is still anti-social.

fq9m4qh,t3_gh8ur0,"It's not a myth per say, you just doesn't have the big pictures, Bullying come in many shape and forms so does the reasons for it.

Let's say you have a bunch of friends that scold each others friendly. It's not bullying since there is an implicit consent to it (unless told otherwise). Thing is If those kids only had that kind of social interaction, they will act with other kids the same way, that's why in some conversations you saw people have a tendency to swear and react sometimes very differently. With times you are supposed to learn to treat people differently, some kids learn it faster than others. This is why overtime the bullying tend to be less frequent, especially in college.

&#x200B;

Then you have effectively the kids who have a bad household life, that could be anything, poverty, drugs, violence (verbal or physical), rape, negligence, etc... Some kids understand very well what happens to them and don't bully other kids who have nothing to do with them. The others are sometimes just clueless and or confuse by the whole ordeal, my brothers stole some pok√©mon cards at a supermarket because he really wanted them. Why ? Because we live in a Materialist society that push everybody to consume with ads and social pressure, including kids. They are the most weak since they doesn't understand the value of money, desire or household finances. 

That's why some bully sometimes robs you, I was rob in middle school, I never had anything of value with me except my school furnitures, so he stole the few I had, no amount of complaint to teachers or school changed anything, so we had to bough everything back and be extra careful of where we put our bags now. I can't imagine what would have happens in our eras with phones everywhere. In the realm of psychology it's called projection : 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological\_projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) 

&#x200B;

Then there is the bullying you talk about, the free one, it's quite simple to understand actually, the bully is bored ? His usual victim that will do fuck all since he is a respectable member of society is near ? He will torture him/her to entertain himself, verbally and/or physically, it's just a way to pass times. I can't say it doesn't exist, some people are just like that, mean for no valid reason.

There is a lot of bullies out there, I am sure we could all meme about the different kind of bully we encounters, and share some tips to deal with them.",t3_gh8ur0

I know 1000s of people, I can count on one hand the people who are capable of empathy. It's because to survive on this planet you have to be either a masochist or sociopath or both, and this gets multipled in procreation.",t3_gh8ur0
fs6o34n,t3_gh8ur0,"Yeah based on my experience I agree with you. It's mildly psychopathic behaviour, they know exactly what they are doing, they feel no remorse for the kind of pain they can Inflict and feel the need to go on with it. They have a few targets , they don't behave like that to everyone so most people won't relate when you identify them as a bully based on your experience. I mean in very rare cases you can look into their upbringing , family experience and justify it. But it takes a besic EQ to know what you're doing is wrong and harming others.",t3_gh8ur0

But in 7th grade I switched schools and I finally stood up for myself, even though I still had to deal with mental harassment and stuff.. I at least was kinda free.
If you become a victim of bullying or not depends on how confident and mentally stable you are. I wasn‚Äôt strong enough back then and it left me with many scars , but I‚Äôm also able to share my story to help others :)!

frb4650,t3_gh8ur0,"Bullies have a talent for choosing the weakest or vulnerable. It does sometimes backfire on them. When I was in high school I moved to the suburbs from the city. I was a big guy but quiet and my old neighborhood taught me mind my own business. One guy identified that as potential victim. He felt if he could bully a big guy he would gain status. I just ignored him but it bothered me. One day when I was at my locker he sucker punched me, it hurt but did not knock me out. This jerk did not know I wrestled and boxed at my old school. I proceeded to beat him until he fell then stared choking him. The scary part for me was I lost control. I really was hurting him, luckily a teacher restrained me. In today's world I could have gotten in a trouble. Even then if not for the intervention of a teacher I might have killed him. Made me check my temper in the future.",t3_gh8ur0
fsqoo8x,t3_gh8ur0,"I had a friend once who was part of our group. He was ok but everyone knew he had problems at home. His parents had spilt up.... twice and he was living with his mum. He could sometimes go to his dad and his stepmom. He was ok. A little hot headed but ok. Then his dad split up from his stepmom and his newly born step brother. 

He kinda went nuclear. Unfortunately there was a kid who he hated for literally being a bully to him because of his anger in the past. After that my mate actually kinda became bully. He stood up to the bully and went overboard. He would constantly push him around (he had a growth spurt over summer) and do things like trash his locker, smear mud on it. Stuff like that. As one of his friends I followed along with our other friends because he was bullying a jerk. He then became notorious for acts like this. He became stereotypical bully like from a frickin movie! 

It was only until he started bullying people who had done nothing wrong that I realised what he was. So one day when he was shouting at a special ed kid that I just snapped and told him to stop. He turned around and tried to punch me! I was taller and stronger then him so when the punch hit me, I just looked down at him. He backed down immediately and after some therapy over summer he returned almost to normal. I wasn‚Äôt his friend after that (no one was really)

fqaplh7,t1_fqao0n2,"Some people even adults, don't care about others, what they feel, what they endurate, they don't care until it happens to them. Then it's real for them. Some think bullying is right but it's just because they never live it them-self. Then they understand what it is and try not insult others, others understand it well, but will find justifications for it in order to solve the cognitive dissonance in them and justify their actions.

Some are just straight psychopaths that can't even understand the wrong-fullness of what they are doing since they either can't understand it, and or don't feel any kind of emotions. You can't reason with these people, they dont even understand them-self what they are doing so better avoiding them altogether.

I‚Äôve tried it too but I‚Äôm glad I survived bc I want to enjoy my life now, without hate or any other bad feelings. Also since my cousin committed suicide last year (he was also bullied but I don‚Äôt what his reason was in his last moments) it made even stronger to not give up on myself or anything.

Before that, I never imagined how hurtful it could be for someone to tease me about only taking a shower once a day (I told my dad about it and he was like ‚Äúwhat‚Äù), but bullying can really get in your head.

I think the people who hung around her while she tormented me thought her bullying was really funny because I got so flustered. I remember some of them started to regularly throw bread (from their sandwich) at me. It kinda made it worse that her accusations didn‚Äôt make sense because it seemed even harder to come up with a defense (I was very mousy).

About your mixed friends, are they part black? I am part African (Uganda), and I think I was/am receiving a lot of comments and hate stemming from colorism. I transferred to a big public school and all the bullying I got came from black girls who hated my hair and skin and accused me of wearing colored contacts (my eyes are green).

No, one's American-Japanese and the other is Latvian-Japanese. The former grew up in Asia and moved to the US, while the latter grew up in the UK, Germany and US. 

I don't know if they were targeted due to race or whether it was because they were socially awkward and were too afraid to stand up for themselves.

Their reasons for bullying are stupid. Even if you were wearing contacts or colouring/straightening your hair, what's wrong with that? ",t3_af25pe
ee01gbt,t1_ee00wqb,"Yeah it was all just mind games lol. WhenI tried to prove that I didn‚Äôt have contacts on, they ignored me. I am sure that if I had just told them that they were contacts (they weren‚Äôt), they would have called me a freak. Their main complaint about my hair was that it was messy or something and that I needed to straighten it.

I have a very big forehead and the three other girls who would bully me were relentless. When I eventually went home crying after another day of it, I cut bangs into my own hair and messed it up horribly. When I came to school the next day, they bullied me for my bangs being too short.

ee02207,t1_ee01gbt,"That's ironic about the hair part, usually African girls are very proud of their curly hair.

Are these terrible classmates from your highschool by any chance? 

My bullies from middle school ended up going to the same highschool as I so the torment continued. I very much wished I had transferred elsewhere, nothing really good happened to me in those four years.

Are you in small classes? A small college? 

People tend to know everyone in at least familiarity and not necessarily friends in these cases. Basically everyone knows everyones business and gossip gets around easily. Routine= boredom so people can use that to start causing shit.  Also is there another section of this class you can take to get away from these losers?

Do you have peer support/ student help centre to go to for help/advice?

I honestly see university as a bigger highschool. There's still the cliques, gossip, rumours, class systems and such that existed in highschool.

&#x200B;

One of my half year classes had group work and I ended up being a third wheel to this not so nice group. They basically left me out of everything and took my work and rewrote it to their liking without permission. And used the wrong citations. And talked over me in the presentation. And contradicted what I said. And gave me the wrong copy of the presentation to edit and finalize then later tell me they were going with another version that I had no say in. And the citations were all in the wrong format and other things weren't even cited. In a fourth year course. Improper/ absent citation can put you in front of a committee for infractions of plagiarism. It's really bad news when that happens. And they were so bitchy to me in their interactions. Like I brought an activity incentive and they said ""Oh we didn't think you'd actually bring it but we'll take that anyways.  We didn't think you'd put in the effort."" A paraphrase to the longer form of which they said.",t3_e912xe

I might have to extend it to my finals as well but I will see how my first one goes today. I have failed classes because of how depressed I am. I have missed classes because of my depression. I have suffered for so long but no more. Also I simply cannot afford it lol.
I just want to stop suffering, I am tired of it. My parents haven't exactly helped either with the whole mindset of ""mental health is made up for people to be attention whores!"". I've managed to keep everything secret from them.


Anyways, check to see if your college has any kind of supports for you to use. If not, try to seek out community supports. I can offer some free supports but I am also in Canada so they may not apply to you but here's one https://good2talk.ca/about/. Its a confidential phone service catered towards post secondary students like us. They will take your call for anonymous single session counselling but they may not be able to refer you to local resources. ""Anyone who does not fit in the above group and calls the helpline will receive support and if appropriate, referrals to other services based on an assessment of their needs.""

I am hoping for you that these schmucks don't have classes with you next semester. I would consider talking to student services about them to try to make sure they cannot be in the same classes as you or some kind of disciplinary actions towards them (eg withholding diploma/ delay graduation/ have to take some classes in another term, expulsion). I see students getting these types of disciplinary actions all the time for vandalism, assault, drunkeness/being high. So why not bullying?  


I also think you should gather evidence of the bullying to make a case against them. Like recording of what they say about you (video would be great but thats hard to do without being noticed). Like record you confronting them about the lies they're saying about you and you telling them to adult up and get their reactions.",t3_e912xe

Try telling them off first + record it. If that doesn't work, escalate it. 
You could also seek confidential opinions/advice from peer support/counselling at your school if that is applicable. Or talk to your professor about whats happening. I've had some pretty understanding professors before.

You know, the bullying got so bad in my highschool that the police got involved. That stopped majority of the bullying. At least no one was throwing desks and chairs at my anymore.

Worse case scenario if the bullying did worsen, you'd have to transfer elsewhere or take a semester or two off.

fyjvf97,t3_htzfit,">I am a 31 year old guy. My personal life has been a misery. I was heavily bullied throughout my life. It began literraly from the day the world laid its eyes on me. I was born with protruding ears and, as you can imagine, people did notice. They made sure to let me know. I was called a number of names, rather derogative terms. Elementary school was hell, you bet. Women, predominantly class mates, but even bystanders in the street, made ugly faces, touching their ears and pulling on them. I was told by a class mate to go kill myself, she even offered her help in the facilitation of the killing. My parents didn't care, or pretended not to notice my plight. Bullying was, as far I was concerned, my problem.

&nbsp;

>I undertook a couple of therapy sessions, sought a psychiatrist, was prescribed drugs to dull all of the feelings that make you a human being. Cut to the chase...I was on the brink of self-destruction. I remember going to the cinema by tram when approached by a young couple. The boy looked at me, exploded from laughter and started making sapian sounds, imitating monkey's movements, touching his ears. His girlfriend was hesitant at first, but the power of evil was stronger and she yielded to it, joining her fiend boyfriend. I was about to kill them both, but I managed to suffocate those murderous desires. I had a realization that day...I could eradicate myself from this world or change my appearance, obviously I did the latter.

&nbsp;

>I found a plastic surgery clinic in my town, I was about to turn 29 that month. The doctor knew I was miserable the moment I set foot in his office. He pointed to my ears and said ""let's have a look."" The rest is history. But in fact, it isn't. I am 31 now, the horrors and dark flashbacks of my childhood and early adulthood are still lurking in the back of my head. It caused me to have a low self-esteem, sluggish speech and a weird obsession with my appearance. I lost all of my friends, because they thought I was a shallow person who cares only about my looks. The question is...how

&nbsp;

>to accept my current self? To love my new look and get used to it? How to cut the connection between my former ""all ears"" me and the present handsome me and become a new version, starting tabula rasa.

fzbzjov,t3_htzfit,"Hey, 

I can certainly empathize being 30 and dealing with past trauma from elementary school bullies. It's why I am here and reading other peoples experience. 

First let me say...

I am really sorry that you had such a terrible time. When you're a kid, you just want to be a kid and play, and draw and imagine. One thing that can be hard is to keep the negative voices at bay, the self doubt and pain. I tell myself, I am a good person, I am a capable person and I shall not be defeated by others nor myself. 
Set your mind to have good intentions for others so when people aren't being good to you you can easily say this does not serve me. 

And if it makes you feel better I got a nose job lol! And I AM happier. 

Second thing...

Something I did that has helped me was talking to my parents about it. You can start by saying, "" I know school was a long time ago but, time does not heal all wounds and I need to talk about my experience as a child"" Then I encourage you to ask them "" Do you know/understand what I was going through as a child and how it impacted me?""",t3_htzfit

It's important to consider how your actions affect others even if you believe your being a good person it still matters.  In this case, you take it for granted that being nice can have ill effects.  In my case, I put myself too far out there leaving me socially exposed.  

Bullies saw this and took advantage.  Part of it was that I didn't know what else to do.  While I didn't realize that these types don't care how nice a person is, that's just not what they are looking for.

The last bit, though ... You might not realize that, for some of us, even though we are good at reading social cues, can still‚Äîwhether because of abuse and neglect in childhood, being raised in a cult, or through some genetic happenstance‚Äîbe stuck on ""nice."" 

What you said‚Äîthat there are some ""social elements that help defend a person from negative social behavior""‚Äîsounds to me, and possibly OP and many others, like the Holy Grail. 

Yes! I thought, finally! After all these years, somebody at last is going to let us in on The Big Secret! Bless you, Reddit, and all your programmers, and the mods, my eternal gratitude!

Reading on, however, I find only this inappropriately breezy and incredibly condescending, ""Why, I'll just bet, if you put on your Thinking Cap, you'll be able to come up with that Big Social Secret yourself! You know, the one that has eluded you all your life, thus depriving you of the barest vestiges of positive regard and feedback that are actually vital to human wellbeing and character development, and which the rest of us take for granted. That Secret."" 

I know you're just trying to help OP help OPself‚Äîin other words, to teach someone to fish. What makes it particular galling is the blithe tone suggesting the real problem is simply that OP forgot to sit OPself down and give the problem a good, old-fashioned thinky-think. 

I submit that it is you, not OP, who has failed to think things through. Can you really believe that OP hasn't spent hours each day in tearful contemplation? The problem is that some of us really don't have the knack for reproducing pointless ""social elements"" of the kind that seem threatening to any who might threaten our place in the social order, yet endearing to all and sundry, allowing us to rise in the ranks. 

How in the world can one do that? I don't know about OP, but the last time I tried using light-hearted banter to deflect a social test, police were nearly summoned. I wouldn't knowingly harm anybody. I simply do not get how that works, I lack the light touch and I'm apt to go overboard in every situation. People sense these things and begin to close ranks almost immediately, and it's so pointless when I have demonstrated myself a valuable asset to many a tribe. 

I'm hesitant even to post this because, even though I think I'm being delightfully lighthearted, jokey and allegorical, experience tells me that most people will read it in a less-than-whimsical tone, attributing to me an aggressive and hypercritical motive that I lack.",t3_hpa2ag

g1gkjap,t1_g1e2qo8,"I can understand how it may seem unattainable, schools are not set up to help teach positive social behavior.  Usually teachers and other authority figures are put in a position to be positive examples or to help teach such things.  How ever many don't bother.  This means kids are put in the position where they can't learn.  So of course its not easy or even impossible for some.  

Books like these are usually told via the perspective of the author only.  I do know that from offering advice here that all you can truly offer what you know from pool of experience but the reality is that people need to be allowed to learn on their own.  Its important that we all are allowed to gain our own perspective on things like this.  

When I was younger I was diagnosed with tourettes.  Looking back on those times I understand it would have been impossible for me to learn how to social with out help.  Growing up I was isolated due to how I was treated, my peers bullied me and the teachers allowed it.  So by the time I was out of school I was emotionally gone and didn't know how to be social.  Think of the trope Sheldon from Big Bang.  

By removing myself from the environment that held me back I was able to finally learn how to be social.  It took time but I was able, and its a process that never ends, after that every one I met was a learning experience and in time I learned what worked and what didn't.  This is the thing these books can't teach.  Actual experience. 

When I read your post I am reminded of that point in between when I was learning my worth but still unsure.  Don't worry I don't read your post as off I just read it as a person who is being honest.  That in my opinion is the best way to handle it.  Just be honest and handle things as they come.  As long as your honest and your intentions that guide that honesty isn't terrible you should be just fine.

Facists and authoritarians (whether socialist or capitalist) want conformity to maintain their power and the status-quo, not because independent thinkers are personally disliked.  Nice people that are independent thinkers tend to be well liked and respected (which can make them feared by authoritarians, who themselves are not).  Mean kids are not liked and tend to be ostracized by their peers.

Independent thinkers can be quite spiritual / religious.  The two are not mutually exclusive.",t3_hpa2ag
fxv7a1a,t1_fxv3wly,"Your conclusion just does not match reality.

No matter if you are religious or atheist, independent thinkers had it really hard in their life. Of course, they had their supporters but it doesn't change a fact that if you deviate in someway (take for example goth kids and how they are laughed at by their peers just because think differently or independently about fashion).  


Independent thinkers were denied and invalidated, laughed at many many times by their peers. Some of them committed suicide although their findings were later confirmed. This is just a reality.",t3_hpa2ag

Confession time: She ended up being my first kiss and she would record sexual things and show me but to everyone else I treated her like horse shit. So bad that her parents would call my parents crying because of things I would say to her. In all honesty, making fun of her in public was the only social acceptance I got in highschool. If i picked on someone else and people laughed then they were less likely to bully me.

Your tormenter may have carried a lot of shame for his actions. He may have tried to tell people stories of ""I remember this kid back in the day I used to shove into the toilet and eat his own crap."" expecting to get laughs only to hear his friends say ""Dude thats messed up. You are a horrible guy for that"" and it made him rethink his ways. He may have sent you a friend request because he didnt know how to start the convo, he might not think you remember him so he doesnt want to start off with reminding you how terrible he was, he hopes that its all good between you two and he can get rid of that shame without making a big deal out of it. 

Id feel him out. See what type of person he is now. Does he still have some toxic traits? If he seems pretty cool and doesnt upfront apologize maybe make a joke like ""Man look at us playing pool sharing a beer, if this was highschool youd be shoving my head in the toilets.""  That sets him up to apologize. If he doesnt, you can hit him with ""By the way, why were you such a tool to me as a kid?""

My worst trauma happened in my teenage years.  They say that when you experience significant trauma, your emotional development can stop at that age.  This is accurate for me.  It's great that you're in therapy.  I'm sure it can have a positive effect.

You are still young and you don't have to be resigned to the bullies.  Take any kind of classes that interest you in your spare time.  You can end up more successful than they are.  On top of that, you're a better person.

fbgl2gl,t3_eczfzg,"I can see some bitterness in your post but I also understand.  People have experiences and so you have either experienced something or you didn't.  So when it comes to something so straight forward as abuse, any kind of abuse those who haven't been through it can really have a hard time.  Victim shaming is very common and comes from the darkest side of social unreliability.  Your teachers just brushing it off because your a boy is a good example.  What it comes down to is all forms of abuse is wrong, verbal or physical.  The problem is for those who can't relate they can't see the emotional scares instead they only see your reactions.   So they take it in a completely different context.  It really takes a sympathetic mind to grasp some ones pain even though they themselves hadn't suffered so.  

In this case rally with people you know can sympathize or relate properly.  The movements that produce a false narrative or steer people away from the issue at large aren't as effective as you think.  But if you promote movements that do things right you can promote a positive change.",t3_eczfzg

Then two years ago, in my 20's, I suspected I could be autistic. It was confirmed a few months ago. Maybe you are in a situation similar to me, and seeing a psychologist/asking your parents if you had a ""weird"" behavior in your childhood could bring you some answers and support to help you to have more efficient strategies to make friends.

fpcexf5,t3_gcnfpl,"One very important thing for me is learning to like myself again. In the time when bullying was worst for me, I started hurting myself, not physically but emotionally, maybe as a way to relieve stress. It is very unsettling because I know myself so well and I know what to say to myself in what kind of situation that will hurt the most. 
I have just recently realized how strong that effect still is, even when I am around People that care about me. Now, Everytime I notice me saying something hurtful to myself, I examine why it is so painful to hear and what reasons I might have for saying it. And I think it is helping.",t3_gcnfpl

If I go full-out batshit fight-or-flight, it depends on the situation. If I got nobody around me, I either hunker down in my room, or I go for a long walk, with loud music, to abreact the adrenaline. If I am among people, I chew a chili-pepper and get the hell out of whereever I am, before I hurt someone. If it hits me really hard, I perceive nearly anyone as a threat, and with 13 years martial arts experience and long-time weightlifting, I can't risk attacking someone out of misguided instinct. I learned the chili-pepper trick in the psychiatric ward, if you wanna use, be careful with what sort of chili you pick. I use birds eye, hotter can be dangerous. The principle is to distract your brain with an easily managable and non-harmful intense sensation. Before that, I usually punched, bit or pinched myself hard to regain focus.",t3_gcnfpl

fpnbvzk,t3_gcnfpl,"I can relate - was bullied throughout high school for daring to be myself, parents blamed it on me (despite always telling me they'd punish me heavily if I did the things it took to be accepted by the bullies). I'm nearly 30 and still get triggered when I see scenes of bullying/fighting on TV. 

There are two main strategies I use: First, remind yourself that the fact you've  survived amidst everything makes you extremely strong, and far more so than the people who abused you. (I have thousands of examples to prove that those who abuse others can't put up with a fraction of what they dish out.) And circumstances in life will come along to demonstrate  how significant that is in a person.

The other strategy I use is to find and focus on your passions in life, and let those experiences (now that they are hopefully over) instead be a driving force in embracing who you are. Whenever those flashbacks ever come up, take a break and throw yourself into your passions and continuing to be the person you are comfortable with. It really helps in reaffirming to yourself those who bullied you will never truly get to you, and that they mean nothing. (It's so liberating to do that to be honest, almost like a classy way of raising a finger towards the bullies)

E.g. I love classical music and science  both of which the bullies hated and couldn't accept that I was passionate about it at all. Cue violent attacks that nearly killed me on at least 2 occasions. Today whenever I get flashbacks of all that, I either throw myself into my job working as a scientist in a research group I always admired from afar, or play some classical music as loud as I can. (Sometimes I do both lol) Really helps remind me that I'm still me despite all they did and their efforts amounted to nothing.",t3_gcnfpl
fq5cbty,t3_gcnfpl,"Have you maybe looked into therapy? Not everyone likes therapy, however it might help you sort through all those memories and the pent up emotions you may have bottled up over them. Therapists are good at breaking down what happened to you, and helping you through all the painful feelings that come with being abused. Bullying is abuse, whether it's physical or not. The trauma and the memories won't just disappear though. I'd suggest trying to work through them with a therapist, or by yourself if that's better for you. You didn't deserve to be bullied, and it isn't your fault that you still remember it. Working through traumatic experiences like bullying is a very stressful thing, and a therapist may be helpful!",t3_gcnfpl

er3q0di,t3_c0d4zw,You need the art of self defense. You will be able to protect yourself and gain the self confidence you sound like you lack.,t3_c0d4zw
er3y8ai,t3_c0d4zw,"I felt like I was in a similar boat as you, except I would consider myself attractive enough to blend in. So when I was bullied, it was because of my lack of self esteem. It's like people can smell it on you within about 30 seconds of meeting you or even as soon as you speak. People are constantly going to test you to see what you can handle so they know how to communicate with you, and/or take advantage of you to better themselves. 

&#x200B;

You will have to build self confidence, but the sooner you realize this the better. Yes it sucks now, but you already made the first step. It is much better to try to build self confidence now than when you are 40 and running out of hope. Posting this question shows that you still have hope deep down somewhere, and really that's all you need. 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately you will not gain self confidence overnight. Probably not this week or even this month. But you will be heading in the right direction and be able to take your life back. You need to find purpose in your life so that you can handle what people will throw at you. Here is a practical example: If you break your finger in a typical office or home setting, you will most likely stop whatever you are doing and get help right away. If you break your finger in the middle of a football game and you need one more touchdown to win, you are probably going to play through and worry about the finger later. Purpose in your life creates a type of analgesia that numbs the pains of life for a while. That is what keeps people going. Find what you like in life and do everything you can to achieve it. 

&#x200B;

I say that like it's easy, but I currently have no idea what I want in life myself. In my deepest depression, I had trouble finding meaning in life because I didn't know what I wanted. ""So what's the point?"" I so often asked myself.  There is no point, and that realization is what a major part of depression is. YOU have to create what the point is for your life. Your life is unique and has never happened before, so how can anyone tell you how to live your life?

&#x200B;

So what do you do? My unprofessional opinion is to start small. I like watching Jordan Peterson videos on youtube and the first thing he said to do was to stop hunching over. When I heard this, I noticed my upper back was bent damn near 90 degrees! If you screw up doing everything you try in life, at least you can say you have good posture. Many people don't so work on that. If you stand up straight, you will at least give the appearance of someone that has self confidence. That's a start. If you have a physical disability that keeps you from standing up straight, work on another physical aspect of yourself. Work on your hair or makeup. Start going to the gym/working out or doing yoga. Make your bed every morning. Stop drinking as much alcohol or doing drugs irresponsibly. Doing these things(not necessarily all of them at once) will prove to yourself that you are strong and you can do this. Even with all this bullying in your life, you are still here. You have succeeded where many, many people have failed.",t3_c0d4zw
er4px3k,t3_c0d4zw,"Hi, for first I need to say you must understand how special and unique person you are. I want to forward you my experience. I've been bullied mostly whole time at middle school. It was bad, I was really desperate, I was wondering how the hell am I supposed to get through it. It was too much already. Then I've come across one project made by actual students, it is called FaceUp. You can report there all bad behavior in the school anonymously and quickly right here:  [https://www.faceup.com/en-us/new-report](https://www.faceup.com/en-us/new-report). They have finally helped me as no one can. I'd say it's worth it at least try. I hope it's gonna be okay. Love, Mandy",t3_c0d4zw
er3yr69,t3_c0d4zw,"I had the same exact view when I was back in high school. I was bullied for legit very similar reasons. My solution to it was being passive and letting it go. I did literally nothing about it and I can tell you I regretted it. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake I made. Instead, stand up, I swear if I could come there myself and be with you. I would... In fact, at some point in my life, I‚Äôd like to visit a high school and try to stop this bullying. The biggest bull shit is that teachers are unaware of it and some teachers play favorites and don‚Äôt give a shit if a student is getting bullied especially if they think the student is a nobody (not a popular kid who plays sports or someone super smart that sorta thing) Regardless, my advice would be to find a teacher that could help and consider talking to them about this. Obviously, you don‚Äôt want to snitch cuz that‚Äôs not gonna solve anything. Probably make the problem worse. Talk to a teacher so you can vent because that‚Äôs what I did. I talked to a guidance-counselor and it helped or find people who can stick up for you. But don‚Äôt suffer through this because you‚Äôll regret in the future. If you do something, anything to solve it, it will help. Get yourself active and build confidence. I don‚Äôt know do some form of activity, hobby, exercise, anything to get your mind of it. You gotta work on loving yourself because that was my biggest problem in high school. All the shitty bullying caused me to hate my self, self -loathe, and I feel like you might be experiencing some form of that... Just try to love yourself. I know it‚Äôs fucking hard. But you can do it. I mean I know two tactics you could use when facing your bullies that I wish I had known when I was in high school. You could try and see if these work.  

1.) Brace yourself, Gandhi created this concept called civil disobedience. It‚Äôs a form of nonviolent or peaceful means of protesting. It‚Äôs when a civilian protests without the use of violence and in most cases controls his or her emotions to behave in the opposite of the expected norm. There is a psychology technique or concept of this, I forget the jargon or terminology for it but basically you react opposite to what is expected. Essentially, when this person bullies you, you smile and give the bully a compliment. You say something nice about the bully. For example, you could compliment some trait about the bully like  nice shoes. That‚Äôs a bad example but you get the point. Obviously this is super hard but you could try it.

2.) You could pretend the bully is literally invisible and does not exist in the room. Now this may be harder and more inevitable because you might always have to deal with the person. Basically, pretend the bully is empty space and there is no one there. When the bully says something horrible, pretend that you hear a fly buzzing, look out the window, greet someone else, talk to someone, anything just do not let anything they say faze you. Hope this helped :) Let me know if you need any other suggestions. Hopefully, it stops cuz bullying is not ok!",t3_c0d4zw

g0w7ih9,t3_i6epcv,"Its never to late.  I find that one unhealthy thing people who have been bullied do is they assume that they need to meet some kind of healthy mind quotient.   The reality is that there is nothing to be ashamed of, none of it was really your fault and even if you make mistakes then all it is just realizing your human.  

Something I found out during the healing process is that it takes time and its important to just let it take its time.  Even if the effort takes decades every step you take is a step to self improvement you can be proud of.  

Here is some advice that might help.

Work towards cutting out negative influences.  These things could be people in your life (even family) or even bad habits.  

Don't worry about not having friends, let them come to you.  Dwelling on being alone creates a self destructive method of behavior that makes it harder then normal to make friends.  I found that you only really need a couple of legit friends to be truly happy and that its actually easier to let them find you.  Go out to places were you have interests like a game shop or a sports game where you can meet like minded people.  Some will come some will go but its those few you can connect with that should be worth it.  Just don't let people who are seeking to hurt people grab hold.  

Create personal value, right now like most who have been bullied your personal value has been destroyed.  As you work, do hobbies, or just take steps in your life, be proud of who you are by doing things or being the person you can be proud of.  It will take time but like any sky scraper its built brick by brick.",t3_i6epcv
g0xhpk6,t3_i6epcv,"You see depression,anxiety and many other things, they are like murderers, they always say don‚Äôt do that, and if you do we would shoot you or stab you, but the catch is that these ‚Äúmurderers‚Äù don‚Äôt have guns, knives or hands nor legs, heck they don‚Äôt even have a physical body but we humans believe that they would shoot us and kill us whereas in reality they don‚Äôt. This is their tool, fear, the moment you have one murderers get some physical form, some more and some more and the moment you give up they attain the physical form and bang. The only thing you can do is be brave, deep down everyone is different so everyone is alone. They say the bullies, they bully you and leave a physical part of them inside you like a horcrux (if you have watched Harry Potter). The only way to defeat is be fearless, you can do it and there is no reason you can‚Äôt. Time to show those murderers who you are and let the world burn.",t3_i6epcv

I've been there we all have.  There will always be an asshat who messes with you.  You just need to build your self up to move beyond it.  

Go to places like justnofamily and other such subs and a common theme is how they dealt with people who acted that way with the OP initially being led to believe it was there fault.  Then after a while of self work reaching a point were they stick it to them and break free of that mindset.  You can do this to, just take your time, and work on taking those steps.",t3_i6epcv

fsyt0wt,t3_gwr6yv,"I was bullied from like second grade until I was like 18, really bad. And my father massively verbally and somewhat physically abused me. The verbal abuse was the worst the lady at the court house heard in 23 years of taking restraining orders. He was a cop though and it got dropped in court. Made me fail school and start doing heroin at age 25. I quit 3 years later and it‚Äôs now been 6.5 years. I‚Äôm 32 and still not completely back to normal.

Thankfully I don‚Äôt live with him anymore but we both do live in the same town since my parents help me with my kids because I went back to college and I am 4 classes from graduating. Him being proud of me, and just being retired seems to have calmed him down. Hes actually kind of a nice person now but he beyond ruined my childhood and traumatized the shit out of me. And the bullying on top of it from other kids made it even worse.

He‚Äôs not mean to my kids at all which is good but it also makes me wonder what I did to deserve any of that. But it was essentially police brutality. And he didn‚Äôt understand I was sensitive. I was extremely smart and sensitive and he just knew I was smart, and would flip shit if I was ever running late to school or got a dam C or something. He‚Äôd throw me into the wall, call me a piece of shit, scream in my face that he was going to kill me, choke me, give me indian rug burns. I think he started to just enjoy doing it because he felt powerless at work, which is weird because he was a Capital Police Lieutenant.",t3_gwr6yv

fqahslp,t3_ghpczi,"I feel you. My 'friends' throughout my life would make fun of me and take advantage of me. I just assumed that was how all 'friends' were. My parents and sister really reinforced this view, unfortunately, my own family often treated me pretty poorly, and my sister bullied me worse than anyone else. 

The best thing you can do is cut out anyone that you feel is remotely toxic to you and try to find people that make your feel safe, respected, and cared for. I would also encourage you to go to your college's wellness center.",t3_ghpczi
fqai6bd,t3_ghpczi,"Now you're wondering if it's you that's promoting these outcomes? 
Short answer? Yes it is. 

Long answer: 
A bully gets off on control. So if you remain silent, yell, cry, or become hateful? They win. Does it seems like they always win? Sure it does....because they get their strength by controlling others. Why do they do this? Because they have no strength of their own. 

When you stand up to them you are a threat, because exposing them to themselves is trying to take away their power of control. Without it they're nothing...and this will do almost anything to maintain it. 

I'm not going to go into the positives and negatives of therapy, but.... picture this and humor me for a moment. 

You see someone getting bullied. Afterwards you hug them and tell them that you're sorry and that the bully is an asshole. You tell them that they're a good person and they don't deserve this, you help them deal with the bullying by helping them avoid the bully. What does this do? It forever victimizes the bullied person. 

Do you know that women who get raped and do nothing about it will develop metal illness? They go to therapy and learn to deal with it but it will linger in their minds forever. Never actually being resolved. 

Now there are plenty of women in the same situation that fight back, some have even killed their rapist....these women, even though they were raped as well, got satisfaction and closure. 

Same with the bully. 

The healing doesn't begin when you begin to understand the bully because you already understand and feel sorry for them, you empathize. 

The healing begins when you learn how to stand up for yourself. 

There's an inner child inside all of us, it's the child that looks to us for protection. When you are being bullied, you're inner child is being hurt....not you. So you need to behave that way. 

Example. If I was walking to school with my puppy and a bully shoved me, I would think that I need to avoid the situation and that I can't speak up. Now if the bully came up to and kicked my puppy repeatedly? What would I do? What would you do? 

Do the same when you're bullied. When you can't speak up it's because of your self esteem....when you have to speak up to protect someone else....you don't matter, and the focus is not on you. 
So take your focus off you and place it on your inner child that is being bullied. 

After you practice this for a while, you inner self will become your outer self, and you will know what to say and how to react.",t3_ghpczi
fqalck5,t3_ghpczi,"I have the same feelings about this, but if someone have a tendency to swear about me even in friendly space, I tend to evade their presence as much as possible. Also when a Man compliment my appearance and call me ""beautiful"" I tend to not believe it at first. In fact, I have a hard time figuring out if people are honest with me.

How to make things right ? When I'm insulted or complimented, I analyze the word and try to review it, the context, the person saying it. Sometimes people don't think too much when they say those things, so over-thinking too much about it is worthless. (If alcool is involved don't even think about it, roll your eyes at best).

If you works your ass off on something and someone(especially a teacher) think you did a good work ? They are honest about it, they have no reason to downplay you and the time and efforts you spend on it were real so you don't have to doubt yourself.

&#x200B;

Some people called you ugly, some others beautiful, some ""meh"" ? Beauty is subjective and it's importance for you or the person you are interacting is different. Of course you could speculate, use the scientific method, ask 100 people to score you and make an average. But it's not really pertinent, those people don't matters only your potential SO does in this case.

You did something and some people called you an asshole ? Analyze each of your actions and justification for it and compare it to your moral code. Don't have a moral code ? Follow the law, don't think the law is moral code ? Read some philosophy and try to build one (and specifically not one that is convenient to your actions as some people do).

If you still have a hard time with it, go speak to a therapist, they will help you navigate through your feelings better than anyone here. Hope it helps.

TLDR: Try to think more about what you do, and what people do to you.",t3_ghpczi
fqb7ucg,t3_ghpczi,"It sounds like you are disappointed with yourself. From high school to college to a mean boyfriend, you have been surrounded by bad people and behaved as they did.

Now you realize that you don't like how you were treated and how you treated others.

Accept what you have done and change your behavior accordingly.",t3_ghpczi
fru5no6,t3_ghpczi,"I can relate to your story and i kind of got to the conclusion that the best way to handle this is to distance yourself from the toxic people in your life. 

Take on a hobby, hang out with people with whom you have things in common, because if you hang out with drunken druggies and you vibe with them it's not your fault and it's not their fault either for not having common interests with you or the same idea of fun.
You could join a bookclub or a cooking class or whatever interests you and you'll eventually find some friends.

However, as for the negativity and the not knowing how to be positive, I'm still trying to figure that out myself. What worked for me (short term, tho ' cause i have 0 motivation) was doing sports, being active, going hiking or stuff like that.

I was scared of being alone back then, because my family was tough at the time. I was lonely at home and I didn't want to be lonely at school. It sucks",t3_ghpczi

It came to a point where just shutting up was less painful than the consequences of retaliating.

For those of you still in high school and are being bullied; keep your chin up. The only reason you are being bullied is because you are a better person and more unique and special than they will ever be.

Middle schoolers just need someone to oppress and hate, probably to vent their teen angst. Once they have their mind on it, nothing can convince them of otherwise, even if they see the truth with their own eyes.

And if you want to make more friends go to a specific convention or social gathering centred around an interest of yours and just strike up a conversation with someone. Believe me I thought talking to new people was hard but when I started talking to people more I found out that conversations started to just flow and if you follow that flow it will just feel natural. I find that just speaking my mind helps but hey, whatever works for you.

Accepting it will not change the fact that people will treat you different, and you have the right to feel uncomfortable with it. If you want to make a hair transplant and feel this gonna help you, do it. save some money and thats it. We just live life once, we have to try to be happy. I also get very sad when people make fun of my hair( my no hair, in the case) , i know how bad it hurts. If you want friends i would say to dont loose your friends from the air force, keep in contact with them, specially now in this quarantine scenarium, its inevitable feeling alone, so its nice to have a company and show that you care for these people. If you want to talk with me im avaible also :), Text me if you want and we chat .

fk6v3d5,t3_fgquu2," Back in 4/5th I was bullied because I never stood up myself. That was nearly 14 years ago. Back in 4/5th grade. It was a cycle of abuse and I never said a thing. I kept quite because I was scared of being a snitch. I regret that now. I was pretty insecure too which didn't help either and wished I fought back. I learned from that experience but those memories are hard to forget.

Point is, Bullies from my experience will only go after people who won't give them any trouble. That way they get what they with no fear of repercussions. They get satisfaction from making others miserable and never had anyone make them think twice of what they are doing. 

For your case, this subreddit is helpful for that. Encountering a bully is never a good experience and does affect how we perceive other people. Its horrible and it's ok to ask for help. Don't let anyone think otherwise.",t3_fgquu2

Being a snitch is when you tell and it wouldn‚Äôt affect you, like if you catch someone skipping class and you tell on them. But if it will affect you, like telling a teacher you‚Äôre being bullied, that‚Äôs not snitching, that‚Äôs getting help. But I do completely understand the snitching thing. Bullies will use anything against you. 

If it makes you feel better, I regret responding to the bullies. I didn‚Äôt want to let them just say something at me so if they insulted me, I‚Äôd say something back (not rude, or at least I never tried to be, more clever). But they kind of liked that. How I wouldn‚Äôt ignore them, I would say something back so they wouldn‚Äôt think they got to me. This was like when I was 13-14. I wouldn‚Äôt be rude I would just have a comeback about how embarassing they were to be so obsessed with me or something.

While it wasn't about bullying, more than a decade ago me and classmates wrote up a letter complaining about a teacher who was genuinely a bad teacher. Luckily my name wasn't on it since I was away from school that day, but it was haphazardly written and the rest of my classmates signatures were on it. I don't want to go into too much detail, but the situation could have been handled better.

Even if it's not your intention, depending on how you write it, things can be interpreted as threats. Have you considered the possibility that the cops could be called on you and that there could be legal ramifications including jail time? If other teachers find out about this and feel their jobs/livelihoods are threatened because of this, it could lead to complications and retaliation from them. Are you prepared for potential academic consequences? On a milder note, if your letter also has  grammatical/spelling errors, the people reading it will definitely feel less inclined to take you seriously.

While bullying has no solid outline, it might be one type of bullying. If they made you feel like you're a bad person, it's some sorta bullying. It's quite normal for me I guess because I confront some people around me time to time.",t3_homfo8
fxj55bx,t3_homfo8,"I know this pain very well. It's hard to know why your friends wanted to break it off. It could be that they didn't want to be associated with mental illness, didn't feel equipped to handle it, that they felt threatened or jealous, or that they felt like they matured faster than you. I have experienced ""real trauma,"" but being excluded is among the most painful memories I have. I also have adhd, and this type of behavior is very common toward neurodiverse people. I would encourage you to look up ""rejection sensitivity"" or ""rejection sensitive dysphoria."" You feelings are valid and you deserve a chance to heal. I am working with a therapist on my rejection sensitivity and I feel a lot better.",t3_homfo8
fxiv5yw,t3_homfo8,"In your case it's normal that you felt bad. You lost someone close to you, your parents didn't spend that much time with you, but it would be good to have some close friend at this time.

You weren't desperate for attention, it was just probably you didn't get it at home. There is nothing bad about trying to get some attention of people you like.

You are not overacting, you just didn't meet true friends yet, only ""school friends"" i.e. people that will give you homework sometimes and talk about school things, but kinda forget about you outside of school. I think that social exclusion is sometimes worst form of bullying for some people. It doesn't need much effort from the bully, but can leave you in depression for long time.

Summarising, you shouldn't lose hope and try finding new friends, try spending much time with them. Probably you have some interests, hobbies, so try finding people interested in same things as you so you will have topics to talk about for good few hours a day. Remember to just be yourself and there always will be somebody who will like you, sometimes you just have to wait longer to find those people.

Bullying is defined as ‚Äúto seek to harm, intimidate or coerce someone who is perceived as vulnerable.‚Äù If they didn‚Äôt make continuous efforts to do this to you it wouldn‚Äôt be bullying.

Sure it wasnt right for them to just say ""youre annoyong"" but it might not have had intent to be mean. As far as the hanging around them and not being acknowledged, i did that too. I would go to lunch and sit at tables with people from my junior high and just sit there listening to my CD player and reading a book while I ate.

I feel guilty if I cannot give something to a relationship and feel like they were beneficial to me. I'm very happy that you offered but I don't know if I could cope with this form of guilt yet. 

I think I still struggle with finding new friends or exposing any more of my cards/vulnerabilities.

After those two years, I finally decided that I needed to stop bothering the group and that it was better to be alone. I found my own friend and I really adored hanging out with them. But one day when a new person came,  they managed to be good friends with both my only friend and the group that ostracised me. I also think my friend preferred hanging out with them.  
It felt like they had all the characteristics I hated about myself, but they still succeeded in everything I failed in. In the end they didn't want to hang out with my friend anymore in preferral of the other group and I felt like I picked up the leftover pieces of their friendship.

I think that there will never be perfect friendship. You can give how much do you want to give to this person and you will sometimes get more, sometimes less, but you should still do your best. In this way you can really help somebody who can't give much back, but some other day someone will help you and maybe you won't be able to give much back and there is nothing wrong about it.

In my opinion it's not better to be alone, you just have to find good people for yourself. It's always better to know that you have somebody you can always talk to about anything.

If your friend preferred to hang out with other people, it doesn't mean you are not friends anymore. It just means that he just wanted to spend time with other person this day. I can tell you from my own experience that I have many friends with which I'm not talking regularly. Sometimes we are talking few hours daily, then we don't talk for 2 weeks. Sometimes I'm busy with my life, sometimes they don't have time, but we know that we can ask each other for help anytime if needed.",t3_homfo8

Alright dude, you need therapy ASA fucking P. That you have PTSD, likely the Complex form, is a foregone conclusion, so look up trauma-informed therapists in your area and call them up manually. The field of medicine is pretty full with shitbags, so don't let yourself be dragged down by it, there is doctors and therapists you can work with. And it's gonna be work.

If you want contact with people suffering from the same disorder, look up r/CPTSD , the guys and gals over there are really good people, and you can ask questions there regarding what you go through and how to find proper care.

For the self harm, see if you can make this work: I do punch myself, but rarely, my form of self harm is anger outlet, I punch walls, or I used to (I have a heavy bag now). When I do not have a heavybag near me, I have some chilli peppers with me. Dried ones (I think Birds Eye). When I get into a breakdown in which I am in danger of harming myself, I chew on one. You stop thinking about punching anything, when you have one of those things melting your mouth. If it's not strong enough, try a hotter one, Habaneros for example. That was suggested to me by a shrink in the looney bin, and it kept me from smashing my knuckles into dust.

Lastly: Bullies, especially the instigators, and less the followers, are simply evil scum. You will not get them to aknowledge they did wrong. They can't see it, they don't wanna see it, they won't see it. I would be nice to get aknowledgement from them about how bad they fucked you up, but it's not realistic. So don't waste your ressources, you need those for you!

Wish you the best dude!

I just search for bullying on here and saw your post.
You have helped me because I know I'm not alone. 
I was bullied all through school and from my sister.
I too have Ptsd.
I've been currently being harassed, gossipers about, and slandered where I live!
I'm so tired and weary dealing with this BS‚òπ",t3_disoow

I was looking up doctors who treat PTSD and I found a neuropsychologist. Turns out he only treats people who have suffered physical brain trauma.

He suggested therapy and said he was going to recommend someone to me. He had me come in and do an MMPI-2-RF because the original MMPI-2 I took came back invalid.

I never heard back from his office. This was in June.

I was ok for the most part this summer after my daughter came home from school. It took my mind off things.

But, my daughter is severely troubled mentally and emotional as well and I don‚Äôt understand it. I gave her the loving environment I never had and she was never bullied.

She goes to school on GA and she left a note last November that was interpreted as a suicide note to a friend. In GA, an authority figure (even a school counselor) can fill out a 1013 which will commit someone who is a potential danger to themselves to a psychiatric facility for no less than 72 hours. She was there for 5 days. My wife and I flew down there for the duration.

She was better after that, and finished out the remainder of the year with high marks, but 2 weeks into her junior year this year, we had to make the 14 hour drive to pick her up and her things in her dorm because she was having suicidal ideations again.

Needless to say, this has added to my current anxiety and depression. I want to be strong for her, but it‚Äôs so hard when I‚Äôm struggling myself. At least I know I can relate with her.

She is now seeking help, which is what she should have been doing all along, and I guess I should, too.

Anyway, thank you for the insight, advice and encouraging words.

eubz5d7,t3_cffv3j,"Idk, i think it largely depends on the subreddits you frequent. Personally I don't see that much pro bullying. But then again I tend to avoid mainstream subreddits  . I don't care about reddit at all, just a few particular smaller to medium sized subs. If those didn't exist I wouldn't be here.",t3_cffv3j
ewjapyr,t3_cffv3j,"Because they think that they can get away with it and think that being anonymous makes them invincible.

This one thing that redditors do that sounds an awful lot like bullying and is rather counterproductive is where if they think a question is stupid or has an obvious answer they will ask what I like to call a ‚Äúcounter question‚Äù. Like for example, if you ask on an ask subreddit such as r/ask or r/nostupidquestions ‚Äúwhy do some people say anyways instead of anyway?‚Äù, one of these smart Alec redditors will answer with ‚Äúwhy do some people say yep instead of you‚Äôre welcome?‚Äù. They think that the answer is in the question but obviously it isn‚Äôt, they‚Äôre maybe just lazy or think the OP is an idiot. I‚Äôve asked about this and I‚Äôve been told that one of the reasons why is dominance. The redditor asking those kinds of questions in response is trying to be smarter and better than the OP because probably they think that the OP is stupid. When the OP tries to defend themselves the redditor will answer with ‚Äúmaybe Reddit isn‚Äôt for you‚Äù, like they think that they are either the authority on Reddit or trying to be a parent.

And then there‚Äôs those redditors that when you tell/ask them not to do something because they either called you a name or made a spelling or grammatical error, they will do those things again just because it upsets you. For example, if you correct someone‚Äôs use of an apostrophe in an inappropriate place such as ‚Äúbean‚Äôs‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbeans‚Äù they will respond by putting apostrophes in random places in their sentence like ‚Äúim‚Äô s‚Äôorry f‚Äôor my mistake‚Äôs‚Äù. If they‚Äôre doing that as a joke, then it can be easily misinterpreted.

On my previous account, I‚Äôve asked this one person not to call me ‚Äúdawg‚Äù. And this person would keep calling me that even though I‚Äôve told him not to. And then he would make up these excuses as to why he kept calling me that such as ‚ÄúI was thinking about hot dogs‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Chicago and we eat hot dogs‚Äù. It was clearly a case of cyberbullying.

And the worst part about is that the instigator will tell you ‚Äúthis is the internet. I can do whatever I want‚Äù. They think they can basically get away with murder on here. Reddit can be so toxic and unforgiving sometimes. I know, I‚Äôve experienced it.

er9uhrp,t3_c0uwac,"I wouldn't say youre being bullied, your posts are just being reacted to by random people. Its true both up and down votes will happen without explanation on reddit. Just like in life people will approve and disapprove of you for whatever reason.

You're exaggerating when you say ""literally"" all your posts get down voted. I think you might be fixating on the negative too much.

I notice you can be passive agressive (""maybe i should just delete reddit!"" Or something like that) and snarky (""mmmkay"") in your comments. That seems to have a higher chance of going over wrong in reddit, because your audience is mixed, and because its text from a stranger. I get down voted for sarcasm too sometimes, but once in awhile i get upvoted.

Your sample size of votes is small right now so its too early to tell if your net negative karma indicates an incompatibility w reddit. Also keep in mind its possible to have net negative votes for a post or comment that you see, that is actually a sum of both negative and positive votes. If 100 people down vote but 99 upvote, all you see is that -1, but not reason to feel bad over that. You're just ""controversial.""

If you want you could try making a new account and experiment with how people react to different types of comments. Not too much though or you might get banned overall. But people do have mulitple accounts.

As a general rule you should not be looking to the internet for social approval anyway. If you find anything like reddit or any social media doesn't add to your life, but instead adds stress, and makes you doubt how acceptable you are, then that forum is not worth your time. You have better things to do in the real world.

fr5as0p,t3_gmow4m,"A lot of people see kindness as a weakness and will take advantage of that whenever possible. I've been there and its's made me hard inside.

I don't know your situation, but I have been bullied many times for not behaving the way someone tries to manipulate me into behaving.  Bullies see me as passive and easily influenced and they feel justified blaming me for things they did, or they just make something up, and they believe their accusations will stick because I am too passive to fight back. They believe their ""evidence"" is absolutely believable, and unfortunately it usually is. They need to feel power over a person. *Bullies need to make someone else feel weak and defeated because it validates them.*

Like I said, a lifetime of bullying has made me hard and bitter inside.  I still present myself to people as kind and gentle, but I become ruthlessly logical when bullying starts in my direction.  If you blame me for anything you had better have *perfect* proof. Pictures, documentation, and witnesses, because if you don't I am going to throw it back in your face and laugh at you for looking like the massive liar that you are.  Having to do that is so scary.  And when that bully finally learns and leaves me alone there is another one waiting for their turn.  

None of this may apply to you, and the only reason I haven't held my backspace key down anx deleted it is because it has helped *me* to actually say out loud how I absolutely refuse to be bullied anymore. 

I resent having to be the person I am because of the periods of relentless bullying I have had to endure.  But I'm still here, and I'm still kind and compassionate.  Just don't fuck with me because I have learned how to fight back and I'm pretty good at it. 

I feel like I have taken your post and made it all about meeee.  I hope you don't see it that way. I told some of my story to show you that you are not alone in being bullied as an adult. It's different from being bullied as a child because adults actually have the power and ability to destroy your life.  

I am so sorry this is happening to you.",t3_gmow4m
fr5b00j,t3_gmow4m,"Hi
Yes, I am a victim of adult bullying.  I live in a senior mobile home park and the neighbors on my street have been brutally mean to me.
It is borderline slander and defamation of character. 
I have become depressed and got security cameras.
I started seeing a therapist because of the bullying.
I haven't done anything to deserve this. 
I have plans on moving one day but I don't want to let them run me out of here.
I work on being positive and loving and can forgive them and pray for them.
People can't upset us unless we let them. Take back our power!
I hope thus helps",t3_gmow4m

fr5s8tb,t3_gmow4m,"I worked in an office where I was bullied for almost five years. It nearly killed me. 

I'd wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat, gasping for breath because I was under so much stress that I just couldn't relax. 

My ex-boss convinced everyone that something was wrong with me and I was picked on relentlessly. Of course when you're put under a microscope every day, you start messing up because you're so nervous all the time.

I was forced to go out on medical leave three times (they said I'd be fired if I didn't) but when I came back the third time, I got fired. 

They fired me right before my first trip to Europe; ruined the entire vacation, and I know they did it on purpose. 

BTW, if you are getting bullied in a workplace environment, do a search for the word ""mobbing,"" because that's what it is called when a group of people gang up on you for no apparent reason. 

I haven't worked in an office since that time. I'm too scared. It gave me PTSD.",t3_gmow4m
frb2sia,t3_gmow4m,"I've been bullied on the internet. I'm 60 and in some local town groups I've been called names and threatened. These people don't even know me. They call me old, ugly, asshole, and other choice terms. I block them. I do not actually fear them. I do fear they would hurt my pets, house, or car. 

The one time I feel I was able to stand up for myself was running into a particularly mean SOB in the lot of Walmart. I recognized this guy who always has cracks on the groups, he's around 40, he did not recognize me. I asked him if he was <name>, he said yes. I then told him my name was <Ricky>. I saw him for what he was, a chickenshit who was tough behind the keyboard. He was a lot younger than me but I am 6'3"", 275 lbs. this jerk was 5'8"", 170 lb. I never had problem with real world situations only virtual ones. I was rational and was not going to get into legal trouble by hitting him or anything but I went over to him and I could tell he was shocked that the ""pitiful old man"" was twice his size. I said bullying is ridiculous coming from kids but if he wanted to bully me to my face go ahead. He just mumbled rushed off and got in his car. He never bothered me online again. 

I have such sympathy for kids today. I grew up in a rough neighborhood in the city but bullying was face to face. Being a bigger guy I did not get pushed around. I stood up for smaller kids. Kids now have to deal with anonymous twits on the internet.",t3_gmow4m

I appreciate you comment, I don't think you took it over at all. I asked for opinions and examples and you have made me feel seen, heard, understood, and less alone. This was my whole hope for posting this on the first place.

These people decided to use my anxiety and depression to bully me... Which is the worst part of all. I love to share the wisdom I have gained thru my journey and have helped lots of people, but this kinda took the wind from my sails and I don't feel safe anymore.

Majority of people at both jobs really liked me and I was good at what I did and got promoted and I think that's what made the picking on me start. Once they saw how passive I am they started bullying. I know I wouldn't be bullied so much if I became more aggressive and combative... But I don't want to have to become mean, I just want to be myself and I'm a sweet person. I just have to avoid all the assholes, and I've done a great job of that over the last three years...

Not me. 

It sucks that even in your 60s you are dealing with such childish things. I'm 31 and my bully is a woman in her 60s as well. Keep your chin up and let the words roll off you back like a duck and water. You also may want to take a break from social media if that's where they bully you. Bullies will get bored after a while of they can't antagonize you and move on.

I didn't back down, I refuse to ""validate"" their feelings because those feelings are based on lies that they came up with. I refuse to allow them to make me feel bad or uncomfortable. So I removed them from my life. The grandpa is nice and my daughter's half sister is wonderful and I will maintain those relationships, but as for the women of that family... Unless I get an apology, I'm out. I have no room for people that are negative or toxic. Since I first posted this my life has gotten so much happier and more peaceful since I stopped allowing them access to me.

I have been involved in the only AntiBullying Campaign that focuses on the victim since 2008 (the antibullying campaign dot com for more help, am I allowed to say that? since it is to help people? ) and one of the important elements we teach is that bullying takes 2 (bully and target), and while ""ignoring"" doesn't work too often (because it is so difficult!) the path to being bullyproof lies in understanding the science behind how you are reacting and using it to heal, and personal empowerment methods.

ftd84ds,t1_ftai0pr,"Thank you for the resource! I love your approach to being a target. It is very similar to what I went thru with abusive partners. I had been victimized so many times, it was like I was wearing a sign saying, ""Victimize Me, I'm a weak, easy target"" and I went from one abuser to another. Finally, I broke that cycle and stopped pointing fingers at the abusers (obviously the fault does lie with them and what is inherently wrong with them) and look at how I was attracting those type of people, I was accepting the treatment, and as many victims I started to believe that I deserved it. I'm no longer a victim, but a survivor and I respect myself too much yo allow mistreatment. I have not spoken to those whole bullied me, I don't need that in my life. I have also found an incredible partner who doesn't abuse me. 

Point being, it wasn't until I addressed my behavior that the abuse stopped. We don't have control over others, but we do have control over how we react. I got my degree in psychology with an emphasis on behavior modification and worked with children with bullying and other social skills in a group setting.

elfza7a,t3_bfodc4,"SS this long.  I'm assuming your son went to the doctor immediately after the incident.  IMO these are your choices:
1.  File a police report
2.  Write letter to superintendent AND your district's board of education with your supporting doc's (med records + police report) be sure to cc principal
3.  Hire education lawyer to see you through process
4.  Write letter to state board of education and state teachers licensing board - don't do this yet,  last resort
5.  Request an IEP as well as a school advocate
6.  Local news - don't do this yet - it's a last resort

What's the outcome you want?  Increased punishment, safety for your child, etc., the school deals with privacy laws and can't give you access to them or their records.  Perhaps a self-defense course for your son or martial arts, even a sport wherein he works on social skills.  Take him to school on weekend to point out areas where cameras are and where he may be vulnerable.  

If your son had emotional issues before or after (PTSD?) get him in therapy, request an IEP (individual education plan) to get better help with school -- school psychologist, school watches these kids better.  What I just detailed initiates action from the school as now they follow federal rules.  My mom is a superintendent of school district.  

Focus your anger, be specific about what you want in future and save 4 and 6 if it bullying gets worse.  Keep a detailed calendar of incidents.

ew0nxwt,t3_bfodc4,"For starters, I am really sorry for your son and your while family! Nobody should be treated like that, not by students and not by teachers! 

First of all, it's not your fault that he isn't able to connect that well and it's not his either. It's just a part of his personality and that's okay. Getting him into kindergarten wouldn't have helped anyone.

However, I think there two options to handle the situation. One is filing a charge. What those children did was criminal assault! The other one is transfering to another school. Your son is not safe there and fearing school can lead to mental health problem that last for the rest of your life. It's also a good idea to go to the local newspaper! This teachers deserve to be taken down and the kids do so too! 

I wish all the best and I hope you're son gets well soon!",t3_bfodc4
elhi27u,t1_elf7pq7,"Oh thank you so much for even taking the time to read this! You sound sweet and I guarantee you‚Äôre going to be a wonderful mother! ‚ù§Ô∏è 

I keep hesitating on the police report hoping things will be resolved, but I think that‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going to have to do. It‚Äôs just SUCH a messy situation. This is the school I attended k-12, so I‚Äôm just really appalled at how they are handling all of this. 

I took time yesterday to read through the handbook and freshen up on all their policies. They most definitely  aren‚Äôt following the steps they take in order to deal with/punish someone who is bullying. It even said it depended on the nature of bullying. (Such as verbal/written/physical/etc...) this is so violent that I thought some kind of in school suspension would be appropriate. But even then, my son doesn‚Äôt feel safe. 

I‚Äôm not sending him today so we will see if I get a phone call! lol thanks again for replying and offering your advice! As soon as my husband wakes up I am going to talk to him and set it up to go file today! And I hadn‚Äôt even thought of the newspaper so thank you!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è have a wonderful day!",t3_bfodc4
elhi9ga,t1_elfuo1i,"That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre planning to do! He‚Äôs 4‚Äô7‚Äù as an 8 year old and I. Dk if that‚Äôs big, but his dad is 6‚Äô8‚Äù so I know he‚Äôs usually bigger than most kids his age. And he‚Äôs strong. Even though he won‚Äôt play sports, he‚Äôs athletic. He‚Äôs just SO nice. It takes a whole lot to get him mad and I know that‚Äôs what would have to happen for him to actually have the nerve & strength to stand up to these kids. Unfortunately I found out that these aren‚Äôt the only kids picking on him. He just didn‚Äôt tell me, he told my brother. Hoping karate will help get him stronger & quicker, but also help give him the confidence to not let these kids bother him. 

Thank you for taking time to read and reply!!! Have a wonderful day!",t3_bfodc4
elhiv14,t1_elfza7a,"Thank you SO much for taking the time to read AND replying with such great advice! I did SS it. Lol. 

How would I go about finding an IEP? Do you know what PAC is? My cousin told me to look into it, but I‚Äôm not really sure I‚Äôm understand it right. 

I did do some reading online yesterday with the schools handbook and read up on some other cases from my state where parents were requesting video footage and such. It made me a little more hopeful, but I‚Äôm hoping today changes things a bit. The school policeman is going in today to request the footage and is supposed to let me know what he sees. I had thought they took him behind a wall, but I found out it was behind some play set that they know teachers never come around and that the cameras don‚Äôt catch. How 8 year olds figured that out is beyond me. 

I did take him to immediate care. Not that night. I had no idea it even happened. The school didn‚Äôt notify me. (They have not followed the bullying protocol in the handbook from my understanding of it). My son stays at my parents since I have class at the time he‚Äôd be getting off the bus. So I didn‚Äôt find out until 10 that night, and even then, didn‚Äôt know the full story or how bad it was. The next morning is when the swelling and redness really showed up on the side of his face and head. He was diagnosed with an acute head injury. 

I plan on talking to my husband as soon As he wakes up about filing a report. We had already planned to contact the superintendent today so hopefully all goes well. 

I decided not to send him today. I think I‚Äôm going to take him to his regular doctor and talk to her about the anxiety and stuff it‚Äôs causing. She can refer us to a therapist or write a doctors note if needed. 

Thank you again for taking time to read & reply! Have a wonderful day!! ‚ù§Ô∏è",t3_bfodc4
elhizvi,t1_elgks89,"That‚Äôs exactly what I was reading about yesterday! The principal has to turn it in and I bet they want it to seem as least violent as possible. Their entire website is anti-bullying BS. No joke. The police officer we talked to that works there happens to be a family friend, so we are lucky in that aspect. (As long as he stays true to his word) he was outraged over it even happening but again at how it was handled. Fingers crossed.

ecwj9uf,t3_aaxeax,"I endured intense bullying from grades 3 to 12. Some of my bullying experiences went beyond hazing to attempted murder. As a result, I've suffered from PTSD for most of my life and I've been crippled by anxiety and paranoia to the extent where I'm unable to talk on a phone or drive a car.

I am now 61.  ",t3_aaxeax
ecwks36,t3_aaxeax,My bully posted a picture of me self harming myself and made fun of me for it. The post got 80 likes.,t3_aaxeax
ed15579,t3_aaxeax,"At least in comparison to some people on here, moderate bullying. It was mostly of the psychological variety (usually girls), with some physical assault here and there (usually boys.) I played in the orchestra during middle school, and some boys sitting behind me would shove their bows into my shoulders. Girls would just be all around dismissive, snub or exclude me, etc.",t3_aaxeax
ecw2yi5,t3_aaxeax,Most of my bullying was in middle school. My worst experience was when some kid kicked me into one of those bushes that have pointy leaves. Motherfucker didn‚Äôt get in trouble even though we both went to the principals office where he even admitted to it.,t3_aaxeax
ecx5ow2,t3_aaxeax,"I was bullied in some form between ages 4 and 18. My hazy memory doesn't let me get more precise, but the most intense years were between Grade 2 and 6, in which I was physically assaulted by people way older than me at times, I was verbally abused daily, got shit stolen, was excluded etc.

Before those years I can barely puzzle anything together, aside some verbal abuse and some assaults, after Grade 6 the intensity declined since I first changed classes, then schools. During that period I usually had contact with bullies during breaks, physical education and off-hours. It finally ended with 18 years old.",t3_aaxeax
ed5aa95,t3_aaxeax,"All through my teenage years.  A variety of verbal/physical/exclusion type stuff.  It's hard to say how severe, I never had life threatening injuries for example.  

As an adult I'm more angry at my school and teachers for allowing it to happen than the perpetrators.  I have no contact with anyone from that time in my life for the good of my mental health.",t3_aaxeax

eda9tn3,t3_aaxeax,"I've never really been bullied, it's only ever been rare disparaging comments but they weren't huge.

Through most of my childhood I was more of a bully than anything. The people who got it worst were ones who were my friends. I insulted them all the time because of my own insecurity, and was generally a nasty prick. It's lead to where I am today. I have no friends, have poor social skills, and have pretty severe depression. 

I guess the point of this is: Don't be a bully. It only leads to loneliness and unhappiness, and it leaves everyone you interact with worse off for meeting you.

Sorry if this in unwanted, but I just felt like sharing.",t3_aaxeax
ede0b2b,t3_aaxeax,"Compared to everyone else, i only suffered a year of teasing, name calling, rude comments and loneliness when i was 13, and as a result i wear makeup everyday and feel very insecure. When i was younger (grade 2-6) i got called ugly a lot and excluded many times. The following year i ate lunch alone every day because i lost all my friends, but now im at a different school i havent eaten lunch alone since, i think ive almost recovered ",t3_aaxeax
edw2ysx,t3_aaxeax,"In 5th grade when I moved to a new state and school, I was bullied mainly by the guys in my class, although the girls talked behind my back too. One incident I remember is we had to paint a picture for class, and one of the guys who bullied me insisted I kept flicking paint at him (I wasn‚Äôt) and grabbed a paintbrush with blue paint on it and threw it on my face. 


Everyone was looking at me, and I just started breaking down and crying in front of everyone. The teacher said I could go to the bathroom and I spent the rest of class there, talking to myself in the mirror and insisting I was gonna change, get popular, and get revenge on them. Well, that didn‚Äôt really work, as despite my best efforts, I never was popular. But I guess you could say it was karma, because in 4th grade I was a bully before I got bullied. 


So I try my best not to dwell on it too much (although sometimes I do get into moods where I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it), because I feel like I deserved it for bullying that girl myself,",t3_aaxeax
edyaksg,t3_aaxeax,"Just found this community -- had been lurking reddit for a bit and was saying to someone else how much bullying bothers me then it occurred to me to look for a sub and...here you are. 

My short version: When I was in middle school (7th and 8th grade in one building) I didn't want to go to school anymore the bullying was so bad. Kids would randomly hit you in the hallway. Tons of verbal abuse. And yes me and others who were bullied stood out. But that was no excuse for the way we were treated (some tried to convince us it was). My 7th grade year was the most miserable year of my life. Most teachers did nothing or made it worse sometimes. It was a school where there were kids who had been held back so they might be much much larger than you. 

Something changed in 8th grade though. Some other kids sort of reached out to me so I had more friends/support structure. I think maybe I found myself too about then. One day early in the school year, on the school bus there was a guy sitting behind me and he was teasing another kid (I guess I wasn't a good target anymore). For whatever reason I felt like I had to stand up for the kid who was getting teased so I turned around and told the bullying kid to stop. He took a swing and me and I got into a fist fight with him. It was kind of a defining moment for me. Even though I ended up with a black eye out of it, I was kind of proud to have stood up for the kid who was being teased. ",t3_aaxeax
efj1er2,t3_aaxeax,"Extreme, being stalked and harassed constantly. 

In childhood it was a constant yearning to escape a prison cell that was public school for me. I was smart over achiever who was bullied and hit by teachers for any type of dissent including but not limited to defending myself from sexual harassment , wetting my hair and face (paddled for that ... even though I explained I was having a panic attack I was in 1-2 grade ) yelled at for not running as it would trigger the ‚Äúpanic attacks‚Äù which now after a hospital stay got diagnosed as a mitral valve prolapse. 

In my adult years I‚Äôve been run off the road and stalked by neighbors, warrants filed but nothing was done because he worked for the city and knew people at the court house. Eventually moved but made my life and my other neighbors life hell for 3 years, killing kittens and throwing them over the fence at her and calling her and her 8 yr old white trash.

Now after trying to rebuild my sense of community I‚Äôve been harassed to the point I‚Äôve had to leave all the groups I‚Äôve made and built over the years because of a few women two of which I helped immensely but were just using me. But this time I have legal representation and have sent cease and desists and will continue legal action against them because I‚Äôm too old to be bothered with it anymore. 

I‚Äôm happy with who I am and it‚Äôs obvious the bullies aren‚Äôt or are obsessed and jealous . It‚Äôs just sad... ",t3_aaxeax
eeqqzer,t3_aaxeax,"Severe. Kindergarten a kid shoved me down and tried to break my arm/sprained it for no reason other than i was white and his parents told him he ""didn't have to care bout no ugly white girls"". School didn't do anything. Severely bullied through to 9th grade, including teachers and principals who would join in. Shoved into walls, punched, made fun of in front of the class who would laugh at me, called ugly. Developed anorexia in 6th grade due to the bullying, struggled for 8 years with it and relapse Sometimes. Middle school 6-8 was worst but continued through 12th grade all while being beaten up and insulted at home, too. I have PTSD and severe anxiety and depression from it all. ",t3_aaxeax

edyb8du,t1_ecw2yi5,I mention a fight I got into with a bully above. I remember going to the principle's office and the principle did nothing. The kid who took a swing at me claimed I swung first which was a pretty obvious lie but I got the impression that even without the lie the principle didn't want to do anything about it. Or maybe even he was OK with it happening -- it may have fit in with his view of how things should be or something. I dunno. As someone who is now a taxpayer I hope to god school administrators are better screened and better at their job than they were back then. ,t3_aaxeax
edadv8o,t1_eda9tn3,This is exactly why my anger is more directed at teachers and adults that let it happen because they can't be bothered to do anything.  I mean the bullies need help too and letting them get away with it is just letting them become more screwed up.,t3_aaxeax

It brings terrible habits as well as a pathologic way of seeing food.

A healthier way of losing weight is to change durably your habits, and by durably i mean idealy it's habits you will keep for life. It means that you don't want to feel excessive stress about it or to starve in order to lose weight, because you don't want to starve all your life.

Your mom is not helping at all by puting pressure on you and by bodyshaming you, if she realy wanna help, she can look for informations about healthy way of losing weight, make you see a doctor or a nutritionist, and pay for a psychotherapy if you need it in order to change your habits durably.

Things change when you're trying to be someone that you're not and feel uncomfortable, there it is a difference between going out of the comfort zone and try to please others (sacrificing yourself). 

About being bullied again, everyone has to deal with it. Even rich and famous people have to deal with media, the beautiful women are judged for being ""easy"" or ""dumb"" and have to deal with the comments of men on the street, a driver have to deal with someone insulting them because they're slow; the key is try to never take those comments to you, those insults reflect problems of the people that pronounce them.

fnk9lua,t3_g27wbk,I think maybe the ones who were peer pressured or led into the bullying behaviour might.  The main perpetrators not so much.  What's more likely is these people learn what they can and can't get away with as they grow up rather than have dramatic personality changes.,t3_g27wbk
fnl948r,t3_g27wbk,"I think it depends.

I've been both the bully and the bullied. When I was the bully I didn't really realize it until afterwards. It was sort of like 'hey this is a kid lower down the social pecking order than me, I'm going to pick on him like the guys higher up the chain pick on me'. It was out of my own insecurities that I did this and it was totally wrong. 

And, I honestly have no idea of the impact (if any) I caused on their lives. When I realized the jerk I was being I was too afraid to apologize as well so I just started acting like a better person towards them.",t3_g27wbk
fo3lvkl,t3_g27wbk,"I really dont think they care, they've got on with their lives and they've always stayed the same, whenever I see them now I just want to punch them, i seriously deserve an apology from them. There is no excuse to bully, even if you come from a bad background, if you choose to be a asshole then you'll always be one. As bad as it sounds I hope they get abuse at home because then they know how it feels. as someone with autism its messed me up, I've been bullied from the star t from school to up to college and my first job, I've lost my sympathy for them now, they deserve nothing good in their life.",t3_g27wbk
fnkpeby,t3_g27wbk,"Depends, there are a lot of reasons why people describe why.  Universally its found that most people bully as a coping mechanism that is learned through social conventions.  Depending on scenario people can understand what they are doing is wrong while others its like a type of sociopathy.  

For me my peers were taught that behaving that way was acceptable, so they saw no wrong with it.  Normally bullies know they are doing wrong, so they create a system to excuse that behavior.  Using labels and dehumanizing the victim is the most common way that I have seen.  

This means by this point there is a desire by the bully to do so.  So they actively search for ways to do so. 

For others I found they want to regardless of right or wrong.  I have personally met petty people who just want to do harm or take control.  So they just simply act on those desires regardless of moral implications.  Some were psychopaths while others just didn't care brought on by something else.  

Understanding all of this I don't think that its as simple as some one being an ex-bully or not.  I know a few people who claim to be ""ex-bullies"" but still act pretty much the same way.  They never unlearned those bad social habits that would classify them as bullies to begin with, while I know of others who have changing as people.  I found that guilt does play a part to those who change though.  People who bullied when they were young found or were taught to feel guilty and like a form of negative reinforcement they change their behavior.  Ironically a bully being bullied usually does not bring on change.  Just wanted to note that.  

So it really depends on the individual, some ""ex-bullies"" are still bullies because they never took those steps needed, others have.",t3_g27wbk

I have nightmares still (19 In April) that the school will somehow find a way to make me come back like I didn't finish a Spanish credit so they made me repeat my entire senior year kind of thing. I have panic attacks multiple times a day whenever this kind of shit happens. My parents keep telling me to ""just get over it"" but like you said I just can't, it haunts me everyday.

First thing, I'd recommend to report the staff member who called you fat!! That was absolutely inappropriate and shouldn't be tolerated. 
You seem to have a good enough network by being involved in college government - maybe you can raise awareness about bullying amongst classmates by offering workshops or something? 
It's very hurtful and childish behaviour and they should've learned by now that it's unacceptable... 
Have you talked to your peers about it? It can help if you have people have your back and defend you/talk back when someone makes comments, if you feel you can't speak up yourself.

I cannot gain weight and when I was in school I was bullied for being an ""anorexic"" although I ate as every other person, if not even more. I know it is hard to ignore bullies but you should maybe try your best to show them somehow that they don't hurt you. If they make fun of your weight or how you speak you just show them their words have no impact on you and that their behaviour is pathetic and infantile. Also, don't be afraid to speak back and stand your ground. Give them a nasty look, or a nasty remark. Say, sure, whatever and just ignore them. The worst thing you can do is fall into that victim mentality. I had friends in school that were chubby but no one dared calling them fat (at least not to their face) because these people had sharp tongues and knew how to put bullies back to the ground. I even knew one kid that would beat the shit out of everyone who would call him fat so we were all a bit afraid of him and we respected him.  Now, I am not saying you should physically attack anyone but just be brave enough to defend yourself with your attitude. Also, try to get close to other students. Those that are mature enough not to make fun of someone's appearance. Be kind to people and make friends who will defend you if needed.

My point is that so many people, my friends, my teachers never noticed how depressed I was. Dreading going to school because I knew that no one was helping me. 
Since I‚Äôve gotten homeschooled, my life‚Äôs been awesome.",t3_egutpy
fcjuplj,t3_egutpy,"The subject of bullying in psychological circles can be very ""colorful"".   In many cases its  a study of trauma, but depending on where some one focuses it changes.  I have read some journals and plenty of thesis on it.  

Victim shaming is a debated subject and is believed to have genetic or social components depending on what side of the nature vs nurture debate you are on.  

What makes it harder is all the reactions people have.  Some people victim shame out of fear, some spite, some just due to a lack of ability to relate. Any one who can relate to being bullied understand how wrong it is, so I personally feel it stems from a lack of reliability.  Most people who victim shame just can't attach the negative component others go through with them selves making it easy for them to justify it their own ways.  

Phrases like boys will be boys and so on are really just excuses.  The thing is though at least victim shaming can be faught off with honesty and logic.  I found this to late but due to the thin nature the logic victim shamers use it can be used against them.  Its all a little diffrent per person but here are some examples. 

""Boys will be boys.""  So its okay for a child to assault one another, well I guess your saying its acceptable for some lone person to beat you senseless.  

""You brought this onto your self.""  Your not obligated to fit some one else's mold, especially some one who doesn't know right from wrong.  When they question this simply explain that abusing others is wrong and why would you want to be apart of a group that abuses others.  

""If you ignore them they would go away.""  Nice try but they don't give a crap what I do, they are making their own choices and no matter what I do they will do what they want.  Your just telling me to enable some one else's bad behavior.  

""This is the real world so deal with it."" Dealing with it has nothing to do with putting up with it or being told how.  I'm a human being like any one else and I have the right to choose what to deal with.  Not you.  

These are very simple examples and the truth is that depending on who you talk to what needs to be said could be different.  I have met plenty of people who just use excuse after excuse until I just scold them for their attempts to excuse people abusing others because that's what it really boils down to.  If you know right from wrong then it shouldn't be such a leap to understand that justifying any one abusing any one is wrong.",t3_egutpy

ekicfrc,t3_baky10,"I appreciate your sentiment and desire to help, but in my case I didn't have one (or a few) bad days, and I wasn't bullied by ""a few"" people. I was ganged up on by most of the students in my high school for literally years, and for one year in particular I was afraid many, perhaps most days that I was going to be beat up or killed while at school. I learned how not to  go to the bathroom for the whole day because so many bad things happened to me in bathrooms that I legitimately feared that one day if I went in there I would never come out. I wasn't protected by the teaches and the administrators who didn't step in to stop this--the principal was a football coach who viewed this sort of environment as toughening people up and building character (and yes, the girls were as bad as the boys--the worst bullies were often girls). I was betrayed by my parents when they believed some of the bullies instead of me. It's been years since I left high school and I still wake up from nightmares about being back there. And yes, I'm in therapy, for all the good it does. I'm sorry, but the sort of thing I went through messes you up--it changes your world view, gives you PTSD, makes it impossible for you to trust. 

Believe me, I would LOVE to be able to take your advice and ignore what happened to me, but it changed me in such basic ways that even if I ever can consciously forget it as you suggest, it has forever shaped who I am. Please don't tell me I can just ignore it and move on and be happy. To say that is to make light of the years of hell I went through.",t3_baky10

You're an adult. You've already come so far, and you can definitely do more. Just know that your bullies aren't going to be there for you, so forget about them. They're just helpless bored people.

If that would have happened to me, I don't know how I would have managed it. You have definitely managed it so much better than anyone else would have. But believe me, you are so strong. You've made it past the years of hell, and even though you can't move on from it, you just have to carry on going, even though it will stay with you. Stay strong, I know you can do it. Lots of love.

I feel your pain.

First and foremost, you said you contemplated committing suicide.

I(28M) made an attempt on my life in my late teens and by the grace of god am here to tell you don't ever think like that, bro. I know what it feels like to have society turn their back on you. To be tortured by people so that can promote their social status. For you to be people's human punching bag. It is devastating, but we will never let the bullies ruin our lives to the point we will end it. NEVER!!!

We will get through this and will use this as motivation to help other victims!!!!!!!

Never suppress the pain. Grieve my friend. This sucks and is not fair.

What helped me stop being the victim and learn to be the hero?                                                            I HAD TO SAVE MYSELF FIRST!!!!! 

Through, self therapy, speaking to a psychologist, and numerous critical conversations with loved ones who can empathize with my pain.                                                                                                   I AM NOW A HERO!!!! A SURVIVOR!!!!

My friend, read this carefully, for I believe I can help you VERY MUCH!!!!!

1\* Be aware that the people are only bullying you to be accepted by their peers , and, or project internal pain that they are going through, or a combination of both. THIS DOES NOT EXCUSE THEIR ACTIONS BUT HELPS US BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR REASONING FOR TORTURING US!

Many of my past bullies are now dead from drug overdoses, facing long term prison bids, or are just living toxic, sad lives. I feel sorry for them.

2\* You must not whit hold this pain for it will only damage your self-esteem more and more. Are your parents or close ones aware of the bullying? I would also you suggest you ask your caregiver to see a therapist or psychologist to help you deal with this.

3\* SELF DEFENSE, SELF DEFENSE, SELF DEFENSE. Learn a martial art. Either wrestling, boxing, BBJ, taekwondo, etc. This will instill an amazing amount of confidence in you. Boxing is really good for your age. Did you know majority of the worlds most prolific UFC fighters were bullied themselves?

4\* Continue to share your story on here and other subreddits for support. Only pay attention to those who are trying to help. Ignore the haters.

5\* You should practice fulfilling PRODUCTIVE hobbies. This includes activities such as Reading, Yoga, Weightlifting, Meditating, Outdoor walks/hiking, Biking, Learning a new language, Learning how to play an instrument, Volunteer Work, spending time with family, Listening to feel good music, Fishing, Skateboarding, LEARNING A MIX MARTIAL ART, Writing/Journaling, Gardening, Cooking, etc.

fv2p2y6,t3_ha7j30,"I'm feeling for you. You're not alone. I remember moving into a house with a guy early in my career - I'm a lawyer. I met his girlfriend and many of his friends. Things sadly didn't go great after a while and I had to move out. The girlfriend felt a bit insecure about me being there. but anyway when I was preparing to move she came over to me as I was packing and said ' thank God we don't have to see you again. Every one who met you thinks you are so fuckng weird!'

Ok. So as a mid 20 something I would go out to work every day as a solicitor, come home and just live a pretty boring ordinary life. Nothing out there at all. And yet these people thought I was really crazy and picked on me for that reason until I left. I guess what I am saying is it's other people not you.

I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so hard for me to overcome the harshness and teasing come from them. I do currently speak with a therapist and i talk to him about every two weeks. I‚Äôve talked to him about an incident that has happened where a kid was throwing pencils at me and were laughing. I kinda got mad as i was telling him and had a little rage, and i did tell the teacher but there really isn‚Äôt much she can do. I go to school to learn and get educated, my future is determined and relied on my choices. It‚Äôs not a choice for me to sit down in a seat 7 hours a day and to learn. All I can do is to learn and pay attention and do good, and if makes no sense why bullying should ever be an interaction within just those two things. Bullying can come from one thing; an insecurity. I wish more students could get out of this shell into trying to fit in or trying to entertain theirselves just to bully others. I wish students can get a realization that selfishness doesn‚Äôt get you anywhere, and i feel as if that‚Äôs why so many students bully, because when they‚Äôre insecure enough to bully someone, they‚Äôre doing it as an act of selfishness because it could better a reputation for their friends and their own mentality into thinking they‚Äôre more better. Students shouldn‚Äôt realize that you don‚Äôt have to do everything for yourself, and if you‚Äôre only looking out for a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reputation of your own to get others to like you, that‚Äôs not even a definition of being a leader, that‚Äôs just being a follower of an insecurity. Being a bully doesn‚Äôt make you cool and shouldn‚Äôt. Throwing random nonsense doesn‚Äôt give you a skit on SNL, it doesn‚Äôt surprise you with your own comedy show, so stop! Bullying ISNT funny!

Two popular guys told me they'd help me committ suicide out of compassion. They said that they didnt wanna do it, but that they could see my true struggle. Out of kindness they gave me one week to think about it, and potentially say goodbye to my parents. I was a thirteen year old girl at that time.

When I was 8, two guys held me face against the wall at school and dragged down my pants and underwear in front of everyone. Happened twice within a year.

Generally, as the only asian in school I was called chinaman, flatnose and gook/ching chong from peers and "" get the fuck out of the country chinaman"", from my peers' parents.

At 15 a grown as man followed me in his car. I was walking. He parked the car, ran after me and tried to touch me/persuade me to go for that ""ride"".

At 20, I watched a movie at a friend's place. He used his body to overpower me. Sat on my hands upper body, pressed his fingers so hard on my cheeks that my mouth opened in shere pain and.. i guess you know the rest. His comment after was, ""I know you wanted that, so it wasnt rape""

He never 'became a better person.' I looked him up \~10 years ago. It took quite a time since he has such an unbelievably common name \(akin to John Smith\). I was on the verge of hiring a PI \(recall that the internet was not so robust just ten short years ago\) when I located him. Living in a tiny town in Arizona. Twice divorced. In a loser job at some company in Flagstaff.

Made sure to send him a semi\-expensive bottle of champagne via overnight FedEx on December 30th of that year with the attached note ""With fond memories of middle school, from Dr. \[my real name\]. Sent by his family's life planner, Ms. \[her real name\]. He and the family are in Maui.""

I can only give you generic advice though. First thing, be aware that things get better. Adulthood is not that far away and trust me, bullying doesn't belong adulthood. Second thing, express yourself. Tell your parents, tell the one or two friends you trust, tell anybody who feels open to help. Alternatively, look for counseling. Don't think that it won't help because you never know. If you don't wanna sit beside those boys, tell your friends. Learn to say no. No, I don't want to sit there. No, I don't want to talk to them. Learn to protest, to claim your rights and to shout. ""I have the right to be left alone so from now on, you don't talk to me. Shut up. Leave me alone.""

frxq8k5,t1_frxiyz9,If I say that they will just laugh in my face they aren‚Äôt intimidated by me. I will consider asking my parents to sign me up for martial arts but I‚Äôm still not sure.,t3_gq3l49
frxht12,t1_frxgvac,Also they‚Äôre mostly in groups and without their group they‚Äôre nothing. It depends on how you look on this topics/issues bc everyone has a different point of view.,t3_gq3l49
frxhj9f,t1_frxgvac,I‚Äôm sorry but physical violence doesn‚Äôt makes you a better person. Also if they‚Äôre smart they‚Äôll figure out a way to make you take the blame bc society just believes people with many ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù apparently. Happened to my brother tho. Of course you should stand up for yourself but in a way that don‚Äôt puts you on the same level as them bc they‚Äôre beneath you. If they use violence they‚Äôre probably to weak to talk for themselves..,t3_gq3l49
frxqze5,t1_frxq8k5,They will laugh and if they continue you put your newly acquired skills to use. If you know martial arts you always disclose to someone you know martial arts first to give them a chance to stop. If they dont you put a stop to the abuse yourself. You dont even have to punch them. You could just take them to the ground using judo or jujitsu. That's all it would take and everyone would think I'm never messing with this girl again. As a father if I ever have a daughter I will make sure she goes to martial arts classes. You will start to feel confident and never be scared again,t3_gq3l49
frxj2og,t1_frxht12,If you take out the leader of the group the rest will follow.,t3_gq3l49
frxihae,t1_frxhj9f,It's not violence its self defense such a big difference. It's like going to war. You have to fight for self preservation. I know because I was that kid. I had it really bad and grew up in a rough neighborhood. Went through abuse from kids at my school. I'm 34 now. I told everyone and ignored it and did everything but defend myself. It only got worse. In my adult life I started getting into martial arts. It teaches you so many more things then violence. If only I had learned sooner. I have ptsd because of it but I'll be damn sure my son never goes through it. He already knows at 6 how to defend himself and other kids if there being bullied.,t3_gq3l49

fp0tnw9,t3_gajjhw,"First of all... I assure you that nobody likes this kid. 

Secondly....you absolutely have to set your boundaries. 

I was bullied in school and I (44m) still haven't gotten fully over it. Even though I'm pretty happy with my life and have decades of martial arts experience. 

This guy is trying to find a way into your head, that's what he feeds off. 


2 things that I would do if I was in your shoes. 

Ignore him completely. Meaning don't react to any of his actions. 
If he puts your phone where you can't reach it. Then just walk away. Straight to a teacher or a taller kid and ask them to get it for you. Don't play ball....meaning: when a bully is at work you have to imagine him throwing a ball at you, if you catch the ball, you've begun the game. If you let the ball bounce off you, he stands there and looks stupid. 

2nd

I would gather atleast 6 people who feel the same as you and corner him. Talk to him and explain that if he bothers one of you, he bothers all of you. 

Next...

Make no mistake. You will probably have to fight. Pick a spot. Like the nose, solar plexus, chin, etc. Now stick to that spot and don't stop hitting it, no matter what. Get yourself a punching bag or make one. I know many people will say that violence is not the answer. Well these people get beat up. When you're dealing with a violent person, violence is almost always the only answer, because that is the language that they speak. 

Start reading and join anti bullying groups. 

My advice to you is to really focus on understanding this, if you don't....it will damage you psychologically for a very long time. 

Good luck and I'm here if you have any questions. I did what I did in a way that helped me get over it, maybe some of it can help you too",t3_gajjhw

I hope I‚Äôm not coming off tone deaf, but I‚Äôm writing a script about bullying. Language has changed a lot since I (29M) was in high school. In the 90‚Äôs and early 2000‚Äôs, bullies typically called everyone gay, and questioned your sexuality and masculinity. 

Like, is there a standard insult that if a bully called you it today, they‚Äôre basically daring you to say something back? In 2005, that word was ‚ÄúF****t,‚Äù but fortunately most people are socially progressive enough today that I think even bullies don‚Äôt go around throwing slurs. Still, I have to assume jerks have a kind of vocabulary they stick to.",t3_gajjhw
fwtmrjl,t3_gajjhw,"Make him fear you... show him a video of a site called best gore, and say you enjoy seeing people being tortured and kill, then you start laughing like a real sociopath, this will make that rich kid get afraid of ya... use a video of a guy being executed or tortured or something, this might make him fear ya",t3_gajjhw

fqigoo6,t1_fqgw4qq,Alright so he said like I‚Äôm a fat ass and that he would say like really racist stuff to me about and my race for some reason it‚Äôs really just physical bullying,t3_gajjhw
fp3xgpu,t1_fp3hge6,"Just because something work doesn't mean it won't.  Even a drop of water can crack a stone.  It's not about how many times you get knocked down, what matters most to who you will be in the future is how many times you got back up.  If he's physically stronger than you, then be smarter than him.  Use guile.  Enlist other people to help you.

Violence should not be Plan A.  Keep involving adults: your parents, teachers at school, the school counselor.  Bullies are cowards.  I have never met a a bully who wasn't a coward.  I have been in hundreds or fights throughout my life, and had my ass kicked a lot.  

It's sort of like keeping burglars away: you don't have to have the best security system in the world, it just has to be better than the people around you.  If you're gonna be a pain in the ass to mess with, then he'll seek other targets.  When you see him going after someone else, make a friend of them, and when he realizes that there are simply too many of you, maybe he'll chill out.

Just don't give up.  My bullies are mostly dead or in jail.  Living a happy life truly is the best path.  You can get there.",t3_gajjhw

fntiecr,t3_g3oy60,"My advice is this: As a guy, only use physical force against a girl, if you absolutely have to. Especially in schools. Too many guys dying for any female attention, too much free testosterone, you are gonna call up the white knight brigade, and they will make you suffer. And they will continue to make you suffer, especially if you are already on the ass-end of the bullying equation.

Personally, I'd just insult them some more. And be really despicable with it. Not just call them a cunt, but really tell them, they are not that pretty, they are not interesting, and what you see of their character is just fucking ugly. The calmer you are saying it, the more it will hurt, because it seems less than a reaction to their bullshit, and more like you are saying it out of conviction. And that presses pretty much all the buttons of teenage insecurity.

I don't know if it's gonna work, it's what I would do, but don't expect it to work soon. Important is, stay calm, don't give a shit about what they say, and really be specific and calm when you talk shit to them. Not just insult them, explain to them, why they are kinda fat, or too skinny, or that the unibrow looks funny.",t3_g3oy60
fntrz4q,t3_g3oy60,"I know exactly what you mean I‚Äôm also a guy who was picked on by girls and I still feel resentful.

Those jerks made me miserable every damn day of my life and I actually hit one of them (didn‚Äôt stop the bullying though and i was bullied by guys too but mostly girls).

Speaking from perspective I would say hit them in self-defence only and don‚Äôt go looking for revenge opportunities, you shouldn‚Äôt do that to people no matter how bad they are but if they lay a hand on you, you have every right to protect yourself and your friends and just because they‚Äôre girls it does not mean they‚Äôre untouchable they should be held accountable for their actions and be treated like anyone else there is no discrimination in a fight.

If I were you I would try and get video evidence of what they are doing (get your phone recording without them noticing and hold your phone to your chest, that way their in full view of the camera and it won‚Äôt look like your doing anything and it will be evidence that you can use against them, kinda like a body cam but make sure your phone is ready to record at any given moment)

Defend yourself if you need to but try and avoid it if you can and don‚Äôt seek revenge and humiliate them otherwise you have just stopped to their level and they will just twist the facts to make you out as the villain (also it‚Äôs morally wrong) so give them a warning to leave you alone and if they don‚Äôt you know what to do .

If this has been going on for some time it's not going to go away.  If they stopped commenting on how ""pale"" you are, it would be something else.

Here's the good news, there's nothing wrong with you. It really is them. Most of them will mature out of it, but not all.

Let me tell you how you win. You live. Never give them anything. They want you to hurt yourself. F them. You do what you have to. I can't tell you how to handle each situation, I can tell you that you sometimes have to break a rule  or hide, or make a scene. Don't hurt anyone, especially your self.

People who haven't lived through it, really don't understand. Even the ones who care. My parents couldn't help me, and they wanted to. Some of the other kids would tell me to laugh it off, or let it go. They meant well, but didn't understand that being teased for a bad hair day is not the same as dealing with the garbage every single day.

This will not last. I know it hurts and it sucks
 It's definitely not fair.

The way you win, is you live. One day this will all be a story of something you went through.

As a practical exercise I recommend journaling. Just get a book that's just for you. Start writing down the life you want to live. It will take your mind off of your circumstances. Whatever you give attention to you seem to get more of. So put your attention on what an amazing future you have. Find what you like or what you're good at and put all your energy into that.

Yeah I wasn‚Äôt great forcing myself to be someone I wasn‚Äôt and embarrassing myself on purpose for laughs but it kept people from bullying me and it made me more popular with the popular kids. From my experience it was never the popular kids that were the bullies it usually was people who desperately wanted to be popular.

fiirubd,t3_f5pt6c,"Wow.. I (female from Western Europe) was bullied at the highschool and preuniversity studies because of my very pale skin too. 

They kicked me, pushed me, broke and spitted on my stuff,  and of course insulted me with words like: dead, ghost, exorcist (bc of the possessed girl), darkness..etc They were all boys, like 5 or 6 and like other 4 or 5 pimps who laughted with their actions. They knew each other from hanging out on weekends. No one from the rest of the class tried to help me ever.

I had a lot of desires and fantasies where I finally could take my revenge and make their lifes miserable. Ofc thought a lot of killing them, but I know I would ruin my life bc of them and surely they not worth it.

I think I told it to my parents, but their reaction was to yell at me telling that surely I wasn't managing the situation right. So, I never told them about my socials problems at school again.
At some classes I hadn't to deal with the bastards bc they weren't at that subject, but I was isolated during those hours along the school year. During those classes I had no friends or people to sit with or participate in their conversations or even make groups with others for developing some class tasks.
Those years were the hardest in my social life.

Then I began University studies, moved alone to another town and lived in an University college. I suffered from bullying again. This time in form of harassment on my room door day and night, and cruel pranks at the dining room and corridors. The subjects were the veterans girls (who were people that get along with my sister during the previous year and practically hated her).

This was the trigger of me starting taking antidepressants and ansiolitics. 

This were 14 years ago and each time I talked my bullying experiences with my therapist I can't avoid tears coming to my eyes.

Sorry for the long history. I want to share it with you. In the end time passes, slow but passes. Ofc you don't need to wait to lose sight of those retards. I think the best way to try solve it is telling to someone you trust. Tell your parents and if they don't act the way you want, tell it to the most kind teacher you know.

evrtiud,t3_c9tixs,"I honestly think they should. Resident 10th grader here and I just moved schools for freshman year. Now, I was bullied from 8 yrs to 13yrs, mostly because the school I attended went from k-12th grade. Meaning, I had known these people for YEARS, and they took a particular pleasure in scaring me or fighting other kids. And because our school teachers were rather...dismissive with this behavior ment that no action was called unless you stabbed someone. 

First part:
B=Bully
Ok= other kid
Lele= friend of mine. 
Me

On to the incident that got me thrown into Martial arts in the first place. Now, it should be noted I am a smart mouth and I am short af. Like, I have been the same height of 5'1 since I was 10 (the time that this happened) and I turn 16 soon.  I finally told off B and he didn't say anything to me, but OK copied me later on in the day, telling the guy off and that he was sick of being pushed around. B then sucker punched OK knocking him out. Lele was in the bathroom as well and witnessed this when he was trying to come out of the stall ran as fast as his 9 year old legs could carry him. He rushed and told my teacher what happened, and from what I remember OK was fine, but it took him until after school was over to come around. B was not suspended for more than a day, and Lele refused to be alone with this guy until last year. Now, me being the big mouth I am told my mother who freaked abd went to the school, threatened B that if he ever laid his hands on me and one of my Bffs, she would personally come and beat his ass. 

A few months after school ends, I am put into a martial arts class. 

Cast for part two: 

GB= girl bully
Gg= girl goon(friend of bully)
Me= obviously
DT= dismissive teacher 
CT=caring teacher 

This takes place about 7 months later in 6th grade and I am ""friends"" with these girls. They are those type of people that pretend to be your friend, but backstab you eventually. I was a pretty passive kid unless I had enough of something to the point of blowing up at the person that was troubling me, which most likely made me a target. So these girls would do things like taking my things, lying on me, spreading rumors about me, and even excluding me from group activities. And since none of my actual friends were in class with me, I had to deal with it. Okay, so this particular week, the martial Arts class I had just started attending was getting ready for our ""practical"" test. Which is basically the two months we work on self defense and not on competition based things. Meaning, we were graded on how to get out of situations, from disarming people with knives to getting out of a ""full nelson"". And this wore me OUT that week. GB and GG were pretty annoyed by this because I was no longer having reactions to things they were doing. 

They took my pencils: I just asked for them back tiredly. 

GB told the class I had crushed her hand on purpose while we moved the desks around: I ignored it. 

GG even kept harrassing me in the hall and I just ignored her with no energy to even argue. 

This all takes us to thursday when we were in our computer lab hanging out for dismissle. Basically, wd are allowed to do whatever we want on these days because DT barely cares enough about us to pay much attention. Cue me sitting and reading a book while the two girls sat on the other side of the room talking. The reason I was so into the book was because me and my friends were having a reading relay (yeah, I know, nerdy) but I still wanted to win. Just when I was catching up to the place my friend had stopped at, GB and GG come up to me, and GG takes the book. Again, I was too tired to even fight when she runs to the other side of the room to guard the book. I was about to get up, but GB forces me to sit back down and tells me ""what's the hurry? I just want to talk."" And I decided to entertain this. She goes on and on about how ""I'm not the same anymore"" or ""you are no fun"" and that "" I was pushing them away as friends."" I rolled my eyes and got up, and stepped around her pretty fast as she didn't realize I was up until I was already walking over to my book. Okay, so you remember that bit about me being short? They were both around three inches taller than me and GB comes and pulls me back by my shoulders. I plant myself in the griund and she is confused. Then, I lift my leg like I am about to streach and I slam my foot onto her ankle and there is this heavy vibration on the floor, a sickening crack and a loud scream. GB falls to the floor, screaming bloody murder and GG runs to her side and I picked up my book and walked past the two to my seat. I only got a glimpse of what her ankle to see the entire thing was black and blue and was now swelling. DT looked up for a second and asked what was wrong, but right then my name wad called on the speaker and I left.

Fast forward to the next day, and she is in a cast with crunches, turns out I shattered her ankle and she had to be immoble for a few months. 

Of course, CT was confused over how GB even broke her ankle within the few hours between home and school. And naturally asked her and GG what happened, to which the responded. 

GG- why don't you ask (my name) 
CT- what do you mean?
GB- She broke my foot yesterday because I tried to talk to her! 
GG-yeah, and I saw her!
 
The teacher called me from my desk and asked was this true, to which I nodded. I already knew what they told her so I explained. Quick thing: almost everyone at this class took a martial art and ot was pretry common knowledge that this teacher in particular took a self defense class as well, so when I demonstrated what I did, she nearly yelled at me on the spot for using a ""dangerous move"", but understood why I did it. 

CT- okay, well girls, you are doing the same thing you are saying she did to you. What is she supposed to do? Let you push her around? No wonder. Now go sit down and if I even hear that you told the front office about this, I will have you both expelled. And (my name) don't ever let me hear that you used that move on anyone else ever. Self defense or not, it could seriously injure someone. And if it does happen again, I will call your instrutor to tell him about this myself. 


They never messed with me after that until 8th grade graduation and GG came to ""support"" all of us. She moved into a talent school in 7th grade, and ""missed"" us. She walked up to me and acted lime we were friends, and I played along since our parents were around, but I made it clear that she needed to not talk to me or I would get her like I got GB. Oh, and GB actually failed 7th grade and had to repeat it. She hasn't even tried to apologize because she said it was my fault for getting so worked up over some harmless teasing.

Also, my instructor was never informed about this because even after all these years, I am SURE I would still be getting an earful about it. So yeah, I think kids should do Martial arts, because it helps them stay safe.",t3_c9tixs
et4enwc,t3_c9tixs,If it's universal then the bullies are learning martial arts too >_> Even if only self defensive moves are taught. I can already see them forcing their victims into an attack position so they can weaponize the defense techniques.,t3_c9tixs

Telling an adult at the school usually backfires because they are tactless and just go to confront the bully. They don‚Äôt put a whole lot of effort into resolving it, only to get you or your family off their back. Then the bullying is worse while they pretend to be nice to you around the adult. It‚Äôs really quite a pickle to be in :/

Have you told your parents?

At 28 I recently dealt with a bully by letting her run her mouth and just ignoring her very existence. It pissed her off AND she kept embarrassing herself when I wouldn‚Äôt retaliate or acknowledge anything she did, therefore she ended up looking like the ass. 

To me it sounds like the girl doesn‚Äôt want you getting your x back. She doesn‚Äôt sound very bright. Then again anyone that bullies people is usually pretty dumb. 

Here is a video for what you can do on your end 
https://youtu.be/AFhA1oVHA-A

You can‚Äôt control them, but you can stop feeding them. Stop defending yourself. If a bully sees that you care, that‚Äôs food to them. 

Suicide is something I thought a lot about also. I know it‚Äôs cliche but you don‚Äôt have many more years of highschool to go until you are away from them. You might even get lucky and they transfer or get hurt or something. You can do this. It‚Äôs going to take you being very stubborn about ignoring them. They will do whatever it takes to get your attention. Eventually they will stop. It‚Äôs going to take some time.

Please speak with a counselor. The schools offer it. It‚Äôs likely the x will break up with her bf anyway because highschool relationships don‚Äôt last long anyway. Ignore ignore ignore 

Your life isn‚Äôt worth these shitheads. Don‚Äôt give them the satisfaction that they got to you. In fact, go out of your way to piss them off by being happy anyway. It will boil their blood.

We care about you. We all want you to succeed. Everything will be ok. It feels like the world is caving in right now. Just do everything on your part to control the situation by ignoring or ‚Äúgrey rocking‚Äù.

That girl sounds like a real cunt, fuck her.

You‚Äôre a beautiful girl. Hang in there. It‚Äôs also likely why that other girl is so hellbent on making your life hell- you‚Äôre prettier and probably better than her. 

Pm me if you need anything.

You said it is mandatory for you to attend school. Is it really? Isn't there a way to get home schooled? Toxic situations are bad for anyone over a period of time. Try anything to escape.

If I knew as a teen what I know now from therapy and online research, my life would have been so much better. I always assumed there was something wrong with me which is why the girls treated me like that. I have learned that I am a wonderful person with a beautiful mind, there was and is something wrong with those girls. Just know, whoever the leader is, she is intimidated by you. She sees something awesome in you that just reminds her of how awful she is. To make herself feel better she recruits others to bully you, because she is a coward.  All bullies are. You are beautiful and you should own it. Like the others here have said, be fucking happy! Nothing pisses them off more than to see you are happy. They want you angry, defending yourself, depressed, and sad. They enjoy it. Think about that. They enjoy hurting you emotionally, what kind of sick individual gets off on that? You are not the problem, they are. Start video taping them from your cell when they call you names or push and shove you. Show that to the principal. Not the vice principal, but the principal. If that doesn't help, show your parents, if that doesn't help, go to the police.

Cut off toxic ppl out of your life. Stand up to them if necessary, law is on your side. And lastly set clear measurable goals for yourself and focus on them.

I really hope you can overcome your feelings of anger and anxiety. I know it isn't easy, but there are some steps you can take to start the recovery process. First, simply acknowledge that you were not responsible for the bullying. I know this seems obvious, but many targets of bullying feel they are somehow to blame. You need to reject the spiteful lies and comments - bullies lack many social skills and resort to name-calling because it is all they are capable of. Think about your positive qualities, and the positive aspects of your life. You are better than the bully. As someone has already mentioned, you would find it useful to set some boundaries and realise that you deserve better.

Is there anyone you can talk to? It often helps to discuss these matters. Perhaps your GP can recommend a counsellor who specialises in bullying trauma.

And that any girl who so as even looks in his direction means that said girl is interested in him and him alone. Any information and any sign indicating otherwise, he throws a fit. 

I think he was definitely interested in you and he wanted to do whatever it took to make you pay attention to him or even be jealous of him by taking your gal friends from you. It's a spite sort of thing.

F is basically narcissist who think the whole world revolves around them. But eventually, it doesn't. I don't know terminology of psychology but I'm pretty sure he was one of just narcissist pigs we can find anywhere we don't want to.

He absolutely bad mouthed you out of jealousy. People tend to bad mouth people who they cannot control or sink. I hope I'm clear.

You did the right thing by showing that you weren't interested him. He basically stole those (fake) friends and made you a favour which you don't have to be even with him.

There are numerous reasons behind bullying and one of them is being rejected by their, so called, lovers. When a person get rejected, their defense mechanism starts. There are 10 types of defense mechanism, at least. One of them is projecting that fear/anger on anything else rather than the source of that feeling. He, I believe, used this mechanism by bad mouthing you.

He thought he could get away with it just because he's popular. Hopefully, he was delusional so much that he didn't think he would be expelled if he kept that behaviourism.

fwy5ddt,t3_hi4bf9,"I see a couple of mistakes that I have made during highschool in simular situations:

1) Avoid arguing via social media. Do it in person. Trust me on this one. Everything written in black on white can be used against you.

2) Dare to stand up for yourself, even if you aren't good in 'comebacks'. These bullies pray on easy targets; vulnerable people who can't even put up a fight back. The majority just follows along, in fear of getting bullied themselves. Speaking up in person shows you have courage and are not so easily to be picked on. You don't necessarily need to reply with aggresion; a snide remark with humor will often do. 

3) Stop getting worried about the situation. This is exactly the goal of T and his friends, to make you miserable and you are helping them by giving them any form of attention.

T and his friends are obviously cowards since they only dare to pick at you in group, online or when you are sick in a hospital. I have known such types, they are toxic and you should stay away from them.



What I would do is block the whole gang on all social media platforms, and even stop going online for a while. 

As for your course, ask your self: 
Are you interested in the lectures? 
Would you see yourself earning your living with it in the future? 
Yes? Then stay, don't let those asses bully you away.
If not, change your studies and persue a different career.

As for feeling down, I found a wonderfull solution:
SPORTS!!!
It is the best cure for depression that exists in my opinion. Start with running and combine it with muay thai, baseball or whatever. Try to make some new friends on the side.

I don't know how exactly your college functions, but try to reach out to an authority figure with this case. Provide screenshots of the cyberbullying. You have nothing to be ashamed of by addressing this issue, it is the bullies that should be.

Finally, remember:
It is you vs the world. See life as a battle, no matter where you are, you will always have enemies that want to make life hell for you. But you are not alone; you have allies who support you no matter what.

Are you going to fold to T and his chickens? Or will you show that you are the better person by striving to a successful future and outclass him?
It is ultimately up to you.",t3_hi4bf9

The Hippocampus is the learning center of the brain. It‚Äôs where new memories are stored and accessed later on. The Hippocampus also controls the production of cortisol. Cortisol is made in the adrenal glands (i.e. adrenaline).

When you experience a traumatic event like being mugged, raped, fight, get bullied, etc, the amygdala (the fear center) basically hijacks the Hippocampus to produce more cortisol as your flight, flight or freeze response is activated. Since your Hippocampus is now more concentrated in making sure your body can better protect itself with the additional cortisol/adrenaline, the cognitive learning part of the Hippocampus is under-activated.

It‚Äôs like when someone gets robbed at gun point, and they call the police afterwards and are asked to give a description of the attacker: more often than not, the victim is unable to give an accurate description because the learning part of the Hippocampus gave way to their natural instinct to survive.

Google ‚ÄúTrauma Brain‚Äù to find out more. If I have time, I‚Äôll look for a video that explains it better and send you link.

I always had good grades in elementary school, but they plummeted once I hit middle school and the bullying began.

You‚Äôre not stupid. You were just an unfortunate victim of trauma and you and your brain wasn‚Äôt given a fair chance to learn in a peaceful environment.

fplwba1,t3_gdzpfv,"First of all, as someone also severely bullied in high school for similar reasons, I'm so sorry you went through that. It is people like this Rag - and her band of mindless sheeple - that make me thankful everyday that I never have to relive high school again.

I want you to remember, first of all, that you are a better person, and far beyond anything Rag and all her thoughtless followers can be capable of. I bet deep down, they've always known that and that's why they - especially Rag - are targeting you.   I have never been able to understand why people buy into stupid activities - like attacking other people on social media - so easily without a thought, especially when it does them no credit at all. Don't be embarrassed about the photo; the only people who come out of this scenario looking ugly  are Rag and the others due to her betrayal of your trust (not your fault at all; trusting someone who turns out to be vile is something no one can predict), and everyone else for mindlessly following her. To be honest, this whole scenario just makes them all look totally brainwashed, whilst you are an individual with the ability to think for yourself, and they should be (and probably are) jealous of you for that. In addition, it makes them look dull and uncultured, since they clearly have nothing better to do than obsessively laugh at a picture of someone else.

With that, keep your chin up, and continue being the good person you are. Moreover, try to stay away from Rag wherever you can, for your own safety and health. Unfollow and block her on social media if you can - she has proven herself untrustworthy on multiple occasions, and does not deserve another chance from you. (She will definitely blow up when she finds out, but that's just because people like her need someone to terrorise, and she won't be able to deal with the fact that you are taking away her power by liberating yourself. Either way, anything she does will only just make her look worse than already.) Find something to do that will take you further and further away from Rag and hopefully distract you also. Spend more time with your friend i.e. the one who drove you to school. Sounds like a pal worth keeping.

(Just wondering, do your parents know about all this? If they do, hopefully they are the supportive type, in which case you can confide in them and rely on them to get you through all this.)

Finally, I'm quite sure this will all be over for you after some time: from my experiences, bland stuff like humiliating and making mindless fun of people on social media gets old and boring very soon, and once that happens, they'll move on and hopefully forget about it very quickly.

Stay strong and good luck! Also feel free to PM me if you want to vent some more/simply need a listening ear. I will only be too happy to provide that, especially towards people who shared my experiences of high school....",t3_gdzpfv

fp228x1,t3_gatocz,"A lot to respond to here.

First of all, if you struggle with suicidality, please seek help from a professional. Therapy is no guarantee for success, but you can find ways to feel and do massively better.

Okay. So, to understand why you are targeted, why people in general are targeted, why I was targeted, you gotta understand that you fundamentally view the world differently, then the people who target others to hurt them.

Your last sentence implies you view victimization because of loneliness as kicking someone when they are down.

The perspective of a human predator differs from that, in that he is seeking people out to victimize them. He or she is not kicking you in spite of you being down, they kick you, because you are down.

Predation has very stark implications, and they are the same for all animals. If you are a predator, be that a wolf or dog or a human, your existence revolves around being able to predate tomorrow, too. If you are injured in your efforts to attack a victim, you will be less effective, or even incapable of doing so tomorrow. The result is starvation in nature, or loss of income or statisfaction (sadism for example) or social standing (in case of bullying, but also gang disputes) or simply punishment or negative consequenses in humans.

So in general, bullies target those who they think they can attack. There is another aspect in there. Victimization scars the victims. It makes them anxious, shy and can even render them incapable of resisting. That is called revicimization, and they found it in rape victims, who were at a higher likelyhood to be raped again. But it works in all sorts of victimization, you can ask a lot of people here that were bullied for decades, in different places, by different people, as if they were marked. It happened to me that way.

But that has implications for how to get rid of them: You must make yourself a hard target. Now, hitting someone in the face can be a viable option. But that depends also on your personal capabilities and convictions. It's the wrong way to do it for a pacifist, or someone in a wheelchair.

So, the task for you is, to find ways to resist those people. Ways that hurt them, and that work for you. Reporting them online if it happens on a platform. Secretly filming them and using the evidence in a report. In terms of violence, going to the police and filing charges. Cussing back. Find ways to hurt them back, at best legal ones.

It also helps to work on your personal presentation. To figure out how to act and present yourself to come off as more confident. Real confidence builds slow, but you can learn pretty fast to act the part (a warning in this: This can become a mask, and that mask can make it impossible to forge real bonds with someone. That happened to me).

That said, there are situations in which it is unwise to resist, in that case, leave. There is no shame in getting out when you are attacked. Preserve yourself.

Lastly: I wanna make clear, while there is things you can do, you are not at fault for anything that happened to you. Nobody ever prepared you for this. And it seems like nobody helped you. You ran into bad people and they did bad things, that is all. And that is tragic, but it is not your fault, you are innocent in this. They are at fault.

fp9agfz,t1_fp228x1,"You actually are knowedgeable on the topic. Yes, hurting them does work but they do not care if I stand up for my self and do not care about my words. They take it as a challange, make the others see and cheer, fight fight, fight. I am a bit anorexic but not because I was fat but because I had family problems and not being able to control other's bad behavior, by starving was my way of hurting my self instead of cutting my hands. Yes, I was raised in very christian pacifist household but i was never dumb. I was aware that they were bullying and using me but i let them since i was not allowed fo defend my self. I am also very sensitive and emotional from birtn, not only to bullying but to sounds too. Yes, bullyiny is a cycle and it happens over and over again. I never make friends, am isolated and somehow bad people always find me. The problem is that bullies never take responsibility for their actions. I was smiling and confident child only to turn into anxious mess in 5th to 8th grade and in  high school i became suicidal with a few attempts of using pills to fall asleep and even falling from a high place. And they still do not care and say it is my fault. Usually what helped me was a teacher shaming or threating to do something if they stopped since ignoring as a advice which everyone gives never works. I was also insecure and sensitive and never hit back which is probably what they preyed upon. I feel...raped in a way, as if everything was taken away from me. Which is why i dressed as a boy  which they also bullied me for and called me gender or even lesbian. For me when i was a boy i was not the raped, little helpless girl not only my classmates made me feel but also strangers. Touching is a big no no fof me but some nasty strangers on rare occasions have pushed me off the street. I usually ignore them. The hardest part of bullying was their stares and smirks. They smirked when they knew they did something and i could not step them. And they literally followed my every step and commented on it. From the way that I dress, to the way I drank water or even breathed. They can act nice, just not to me. And I do not understand how you can hate someone you do not know. And their parents either do not know, do not care or when i tell their mothers they bully comes to me and screams. Bullies hate people who cry, and I cry a lot. I cant stand up for my self without crying and standing up for my self meant being hit in the chest or being left alone. They call you crybaby and only want to insult you. I was not insulted by some of their insults but they are persistent and if you do not give them what they want they become touchy ans agressive. I hare being harassed for being my self. In high school i isolated my self a lot, especially during the summer. I ignore when i classmate called out my name to me, etc. They do not know why avoid them, like why. I was never good at sports either since i was a fake tomboy and i have many health problems. Basically they think they could use you and abuse you. I am aware. Being agressive does work but i rarely pull it off since they are ready to fight for their ego and i cant fight with my pacifist mindset and anorexic body. Plus i never knew how to make good friends, usually mine were outside school. But i need friends at school since even if i had one person next to me people left me alone, but when i am alone and anxious it is somehow ok to harass me. I do not understand their dumb mentality. When they tell their friends to harass me as well. It is usually 6 boys a gang of morons, one girl, who is a bichy and dresses like ...you know and their boy friends outside of class. It has happened in middle and high school both. Somehow being me is associated with being trash and low status when it is their fault for not liking me or being friends with me since i cannot force anyone to like me or being my friend. They also think they are superior just cause they smoke which is bs. No one is superior for drinking or smoking. If you want you can do it. I am afraid of smiling since in school trips everyimte i smiled i was pushed physically so i hide it. They are narcissistic in a way, egoistically touchy, they can hit you and spit on you but if you say something to them, that is not even an insult, they create a rumour for the whole school to know and spread lies about you, telling people who yo udont even know to hate you. Bullying for me happens again and again, it was my number one fear, even scarier than spiders. And now i am dirty because of it. This is why i tried to kill my self, since bullying was nevet supposed to happen, not to me. I should have not experienced it. And i am afraid of being happy since narcissitic assholes always target me. I used yo be a people pleaser but that was because of my unstable family, now i am not.

I experienced the same bullying in middle school back in the mid-80s. It really shaped the way I saw myself for decades. I didn‚Äôt finally accept myself until my early 40s.

I wish the channel was still up, but there was these videos I watched on YouTube of these 3 guys who would do really stupid things in order to get girl‚Äôs phone numbers.

They were totally ordinary guys, who were all introverts as children and were never good at social interactions. Especially when it came to women.

Two or the three original guys met on an online ‚Äúpick-up‚Äù forum. They got together and started experiencing ways to find the courage to approach women and conquer their social anxiety, thus instilling confidence in the process.

It was hit and miss. They crashed and burned so many times, initially. However, they soon overcame their shyness and their self esteem was altered in a positive way.

They‚Äôre all millionaires, now, and are in relationships. There‚Äôs only one original founder remaining and he changed the channels content. It‚Äôs unfortunate, because their videos were genuinely inspirational.

I am married, so I wasn‚Äôt interested in meeting women, but their philosophy was very sound. It made perfect sense. I applied it to my own life, and I have to say it really changed me and the way I now perceive myself.

I still have demons regarding my bullies, and I‚Äôm still an introvert at heart, but I am completely comfortable in my own skin, and have accepted me for me and that has given me the confidence I didn‚Äôt have the majority of my life.

I don‚Äôt know how much you can relate to this, or if this even helps, but I hope you eventually find peace.

As weird as it sounds, I think self hatred/loathing is masochistic. It's almost self serving in that way. Some people convince themselves that through self loathing they are somehow making a positive difference in their life. But at the end of the day, all your doing is wasting your time and energy. Self loathing accomplishes nothing. 

If the problem indeed lies with you. The key is to have patience, and realize that change takes time. Sometimes months, sometimes even years. And that's not a bad thing. It just means your human. Forgive yourself for any mistakes you've made, and celebrate the small victories. Ask for help and advice from those you trust. If you don't have anyone, maybe it's time to start looking for good people to hang out with. At work, or outside of work. 

Being bullied also doesn't mean life comes to a standstill. Take good self care.

fdp1o2e,t3_emgmop,"I feel that compassion may provide relief  from the uncomfortable feelings in your mind. These people that are making fun and laughing at you are not truly happy people. It may look like it on the outside, but how does a happy person act? A truly happy person does not make fun of others, there is no need. They make fun because there is pain in them, and they incorrectly think that by causing others pain that will lessen theirs. Also people may talk behind your back for a similar reason. They have low self esteem, and in their mind they try to talk down about you to make themselves look better. However both of these methods are self destructive and make the problems worse. 

Yes people have made fun of you for this or that, but that is not your identity. Only you know all of your achievements, sacrifices, and achievements that you have made. These other people know almost nothing about you. So not only are they not happy people, they are also ignorant. 

When you sincerely try to understand what may be the motivation for people to act this way, compassion grows in you. These people have not learned how to deal with life as you have. So they are still people, each with their own insecurities, fears, depression, greed, bad habits etc. 

Using this knowledge, you can view these situations the same way as a small child that is misbehaving in a public place or crying in a quiet setting: they simply do not know any better. They may even know that what they are doing is wrong and hurtful, but they do not know how to go about changing their behavior. Remember they are not happy and are trying to do whatever they can to get rid of their unhappiness, without realizing it is only continuing their negativity. 

So by strengthening yourself, you will be more prepared to deal with situations such as these. I think this video and others from this channel may help you.

f6mgo6k,t3_drsffp,"Most of the time schools just don't care or don't want to get involved because of the legal hell that might unleash should any party go the police. The school's reputation and everything is going to be at risk so naturally they would like to avoid this kind of things. In my school it was to the point when I was pushed around, called names and spat on literally in front of my IT teacher and she did NOTHING about it, she didn't even say a damn word. So I guess the best approach would be not to focus on ""cracking"" bullies down but rather on teaching the ones who are bullied to defend themselves in any way, unless they are physically incapable to do so because of a disablity or a disease in which case I can only suggest changing schools or switching to homeschooling. But again, I don't really think schools have any interest in stopping bullying, they usually only want to keep as silent about it as they can. I do think that video surveillance can be of help but it wouldn't take long for bullies to figure out that they can keep on bullying in toilets or follow their victims outside of school. In my case, when my math teacher decided to (finally) do something about it, which was basically her telling the guy to not do it again and making him apologise, he got even angrier and threatened to murder me and my family, which sounds ridiculous now but back in 8th grade I didn't know any better and hence was scared shitless.

f6z0q3p,t3_drsffp,"More of a long-term approach: So I had to go through about 7 years of bullying, 4 of them severe, through the last 3 the intensity lessened. There was a reason for that. After 4 years I switched to another school, one focused on pedagogy. At first there was no bullying there, but my social mannerism, impeded by years of bullying, took care of that and it soon started again. But at that school we learned about emotions, development, social dynamics, and the more my colleagues learnt about what they did and what effect it had on me the less they did it.
At the end I got actual apologies that came from my colleagues own incentive because they genuinely felt bad about what they had done. The last 2 years of my school education I got along well with all of them. We weren't close buddies, don't get me wrong, but the relationship between them and me was characterized by mutual respect and empathy.

Long story short: I think that taking a stronger focus on the emotional development of children at schools, such as implementing it in the curriculum early on and incoroprating it into educational culture as a whole (and yes, an actual subject for emotional and social development would not be too far fetched) would not only help victims of bullying but society as a whole.",t3_drsffp

If not, is a mere indifference to causing collateral harm (in the context of unwelcome ""help""  sufficient to call something bullying?

f4uy82p,t1_f4rks2x,"Thing is that in both situations we have two common factors. The first being that both groups never really looked at how what they did affect the other person.   The second being how skewed each group was.   Like people who bully someone and excuse their behavior by stating its just a joke.  In the second case, I really do think this person tried to help however his need to do so was rooted in egotism.  I personally learned a long time ago that to really help someone you need to be considerate for that person and understand the consequences behind your actions.

In the first case, I think it was unintentional while the second it was a case of highspeed being diluted into believing it was for some good.

As for being right, the thing is to understand a certain distinction of what makes a bully.  Nowadays I find people muddy the idea of what makes a bully versus someone who just happens to be pounding some sense into you.  It's assumed that anyone who shows aggression is a bully and that's it.  So a mother scolding her child to prevent them from doing something potentially self-harming is seen as bullying for example.  Or someone who is just having a bad day and acting grumpy is labeled as a bully.

I think it comes down to intent and mindfulness of others.  There's is too much to interaction to just assuming it's just as simple as person A saying something to person B.  If that was the case debates like this wouldn't exist.  A bully generally has alternative reasons to do what they do.  Like filling a need to get something or using a person to gain an ego boost.  Let me give examples.

When I worked as a guard for the first time one of my co-workers, ( a guard they used to deliver mail) really played into me.  At the time I was new and actually nervous about the work.  However, the manager at the time was very lax, really he was afraid of exercising any authority so being new I started to sort of fallow suite.  I started watching DVDs at night while not on patrol.  (I was on graveyard shift from 10 pm to 6 am)  One day the mail guy comes in and goes off.  He told me that my attempts at trying too hard just make me look like I don't know how to do my job and the DVD player just made it look like I didn't care.  He was a retired marine so it was loud and intense.  After it was done of course I was upset, I felt really mad but after I cooled off I thought about it and figured he was right.  His yelling though wasn't in his benefits and despite his harshness could only benefit me in the end if I followed what he was saying.

On the other end, I remember watching a talk show when fatshaming became a thing.  They had three overweight women on the show and a couple of people basically talking to them about it.   It was meant to be a basic debate of ideas of health but one of the ladies was just downright vicious.  The first lady was trying to offer to advise to the others while the second just kept laying the three women low.  Saying things like, well don't you want to be liked, or don't you feel that it's your fault.  You could tell there was no benefit to anyone and that the second lady was just acting out of bitterness.",t3_dlk13w
f4y71pw,t1_f4uy82p,"One other big difference in the two scenarios in your original post though is that in the first one, a third party (you) intervened, but in the second no third party intervened for you. Is it possible if an equivalent person (not you, because you were the ""target"") intervened in the second scenario they might have backed off or changed tactic to a more constructive one, where even if they were sure they were right, you guys could have ended it with a civil ""agree to disagree"" situation?

My gut feeling is that many ""im just helping"" perpetrators/bullies would react differently to a third party opinion, compared to the target defending himself, even if the reasons given would be the same. I think these types of bullies have already passed judgement on their targets as being deficient in some way/""needing"" help so the targets opinions matter less. They might not have given as much thought to a third party, so its just long enough for them to consider they might be wrong. 

I think you're right about the intent and mindfulness stuff. Either intentionally doing harm (even as a secondary gain/being in denial about meaning to do harm), or doing and especially continuing to ""accidentally"" do harm because you just can't be bothered to stop and think about the consequences to others. 

I wonder if theres some algorithm for managing bullying behavior once the type of bullying is identified. I know theres some pages online that identify types of bullying but i dunno how utilitarian those categories are. 

I think its interesting too how you can identify one guys tirade as helpful and the other ladys tirade as not helpful. I can see that too, and im sure in general, many others are able to make the distinction, in comparable situations... But not everyone is good at that. I agree some people use the term bully pretty liberally and others downplay real, damaging, scarring bullying.

So now i wonder, how can people fairly identify themselves as being bullied, or not? How can people identify themselves as having bullied others, or not? 

This is kind of a fun convo thanks for starting and humoring me :)",t3_dlk13w
f4zre7g,t1_f4y71pw,"I noticed that with concepts like microaggresion people are more willing to jump to the conclusion of calling someone a bully just to force that distinction.  So right now the idea is muddied.  I think that's why it's important to understand things like a persons motives right now to help distinguish a real bully versus someone just having an off day.  

I can really understand that no one wants to be bullied, from what I can see one defense a person can have is to claim that everyone is a bully to try to create a barrier.   The idea of what's acceptable and not also plays a part.  Some people tolerate a little shit talking for example while others tolerate a lot.  Where is the line when someones shit-talking becomes no longer tolerable and just degrading?

Some people lose sight of the idea that there is a line and will cross it like in my first scenario while others know there is a line and will cross it intentionally.  Trust me when I say that I have dealt with these types and I've classified them as petty bullies.  Stating that his claim to help me was just a way to justify his actions, I didn't look at this way and it makes sense.  Most bullies fall into the label maker types.  These people will start messing with someone and then to justify their actions will label the victim to dehumanize that person.  By doing this the bully creates a personal excuse, so using the word ""help"" can be another method.  

As for managing, of course, there is.  Of course, the best thing to do is prevention but in cases where bullying is already an issue a person needs help.  Most people that I have talked to on a clinical level sums it as bullying being used as a cheap coping mechanism akin to drugs.  It's easy, it can make you happy and even elevate someone socially.  Think about it, most bullies start young when a child is learning how to cope in social situations.  A child talks some crap gets a laugh from his or her friends and they feel good.  But like any drug the high is only temporary and in the moment situation.  So, of course, they start to yearn for it, they focus on how to obtain that high and become bullies as a result.  However, something very easy to know about the pleasure center of the brain is that the more you create the same stimulation the less effective it becomes, the less serotonin it releases.  It's a very easy coping mechanism to get into at a young age but its a trap.  People who start doing it can lose the ability to gain normal coping mechanisms later on.  So if you ever wondered why bullies are usually so unstable this is why.  

So with this all in mind to help a bully stop bullying you need to remove the need and help create healthier coping habits.  Even bullies who don't realize what they are doing still fall into this category just with the exception that they are ignorant of the first step.  They don't excuse their behavior because to them there is no reason to.  But the rest still applies.  

Yeah, I got a ton of this stuff, I mastered in psych and due to my past, I have a vested interest.  If want to keep talking I'm more than willing to.",t3_dlk13w
f4zres5,t1_f4zre7g," Hi more, I'm Dad!",t3_dlk13w
f6efizy,t1_f4zre7g,"Sorry i took a while to respond, but the topics here are still interesting to me. I agree the definition is muddy.. It may be more useful to identify behaviors or patterns than when slap a whole person label on someone. 

Would you say it could help to encourage a cultural shift for people to routinely ask themselves, if they encounter resistance, ""have i labelled/pass judgement on this person?"" Like could this be a first step in an algorithm of self identifying or policing behaviour?

For those that are not capable of doing this for themselves, i can guess that a good early question for a third party intervener might be ""is there something triggering the bullying behavior resulting in them using this as a coping mechanism?""... But then it seems a larger barrier to intervention is that they aren't capable of identifying ""real bullying"" from ""kids being kids"" or from ""the target needs to toughen up.""

For those who are targets, do you see any kind of cultural shift that could be implemented on a wide scale for targets of bullying to make it clear to agressors, and to third party interveners that the offensive behavior needs to stop?  For example, by now, (although is not a perfect system) its a cultural norm that for sexual assault in general ""no means no."" The agressor is expected to know this, third parties are expected to know this. But there doesn't seem to be as strong a cultural buy in for general bullying. 

Do you think you'll study this further or get a phd? I know to some extent there must be formalized studies and diagnoses relating to bullying (like conduct disorder or antisocial personality disorder and such). But i don't know or any real gold standard or treatment paradigm or comprehensive plans to shift the culture around bullying. In my fantasy world there must  exist a set of algorithms to approach this problem from each participants angle (perpetrator, target, third party witness, cultural shift) but i just haven't seen it yet haha.

I really think a well thought out approach could have broader implications to things like racism and sexism and xenophbias too, that would hopefully make ""unprotected"" populations feel less alienated. 

I studied a little bit of psych and have only been bullied a little but have witnessed it more. I think i might be one of the lucky few who are able to react with a more ""well wtf was that about?"" rather than internalizing it, when iy happened to me. I did try standing up to some for friends before but ive always been small so we ended up running away. Yeesh. :p",t3_dlk13w
f6hwzoz,t1_f6efizy,"Cultural shifts take time and effort but yes, being more mindful of a person's actions or of our own would help.  Currently, rage culture has justified needless labeling and its currently popular.  Just being in this sub you can see it happening to some of the younger posters.  So if you look back at social norms and compare then with the current state you see what I mean. Look back a couple of decades bullying was more clear cut but no matter what however there will always be those social elements that will cause confusion.  

In my case, I majored in psych and have also been heavily bullied in the past.  Looking into it the best metaphor to describe bullying is by calling a social drug.  Like a drug, it can deliver a high but in the long run degrade the user.  A kid who starts bullying enjoys that social high of not only being accepted but a kind of self-gratification.  Psychologically people have tied bullying in more with the ego element.  Children who start bullying will use it as a tool of self mental preservation.  Depending on what culture you live in this is more important as a child so bullying can or will not be a factor based on this.  This means that if you look at it from the other direction it's also true.  I found by looking at cultures that have less bullying than others have ways that prevent the behavior early on.   

If you look at these cultures vs those that have more of a bullying issue elements like what's socially accepted, recognition of the issue and how it's handled all play a part.

f4bijs2,t3_dk88yk,"No. The thing about bullying is, that like all abuse, it makes your life circle around it. The anxiety, and depression, even flashbacks and psychomatic issues, behavioral patterns are in many ways caused by the bullying, or a way to make sure that it never happens again.

I think recovering from bullying we ought to seek ways in which we can minimize our multiple ways we circle around that past experience. And from that point of view, exacting revenge on your former bullies is completely wrong. Not just does it bring you nothing, aside some feeling of gratification, it will put you in jail likely.

f4fa752,t3_dk88yk,"I was diagnosed with ptsd because in 7th grade a girl and her group of friends spread rumors about me. I always knew I had it, but my mom, she never believed it. She had been really tough and endured so many bad things in her life, it's almost as if she became so numb to the trauma it couldn't get to her anymore. 

She just yold me to get over it, though I never did. Now at 20, I still think back about the things they said about me and what I should have said to them.

Not sure if telling her off would be considered getting revenge, but that's the only thing I would do. Also, it turned out she had been jealous of how i looked. She rumored me to be an awwful lot of things like sl*t or wh*re.

I'm not sure though maybe she had changed, i basically found her instagram with a quote that said she believed in standing up for others. The question that always reeled on my head was, What about me? It just made me feel that she had contradicted all of what she was saying.

People suggested that I write her letter or message her, but scared as alwsys I never did and probably never will. (I just got diagnosed with ptsd in late september of this year and I'm just barely learning to revover. That and my meds. I was on a drug that sedated me for 4 years, so much so that I never moved on with my life.) I'm on a new med and so far, it's proving to work! (I have bipolar as well)

You know what? I may write her a letter, but never send it. It will make me feel better. At this point I think life had gotten better for me, so I think moving forward and bettering your life for you is the best revenge.

Either way though, a part of me feels revenge is wrong. My bully still lives in the next city over from me, in fact the year after I told her I wss going back to my original school, she transferred there the very next year. If i recall that was around testing time when I told her.

She made a whole scene in front of the teacher to get moved to the empty desk in front of me and whisper to her friends in front of me because she knew it bothered me. It makes me angry because the whole school found out I got into a bad accident and really could have died.

Hindsight is 20/20 and I'm sure all of us wish we did or handled things differently during the bullying. As bad as my bullying was, I must admit, I learned a lot from the experience. What frustrated me is that there was no way I could put what I learned to use in order to get back at the people who harmed me. Everything was done, and everyone was long gone, even all the way to other countries. It's been so long I can't even track some people now. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that in your journeys through life, you'll probably end up meeting some people who bullied others in their youth, and still haven't learned their lesson even as adults. They likely also have victims who suffered greatly but cannot get back at their abuser. You, with everything you learned, can put this bully in their place and be this unknown person's justice.

Especially if the recipient is someone who is not a very good person, something they often do is play the victim and paint you as the bad person. I have seen this all too often.

Here is the thing about such situations:

1.) If you hold bad people accountable, they usually don't care. They are not good people. They will deflect, act indignant, or with anger.

2.) If you hold good people accountable who messed up, they will probably agree with you and apologize profusely or feel bad. They might even feel so bad sometimes that you will feel kind of sorry for unloading on them after, instead of relief. Sometimes it can result in a friendship, if you can forgive them.

I can guarantee you that the same three/four people who bullied me in middle school / high school (online) still make fun of me. Once bullies find their target, they hardly ever let go. 

The biggest kicker, the school administration or my friends / even teachers did nothing and stood by as it happened. 

It fucked with my self esteem for awhile. I got depressed. Socially anxious, exactly like you. They often publicly (and online - directly on the post) made fun of the fact that I looked mad.

Here's an example: I'm in class, in post-secondary, and we're doing a practice oral presentation for those who haven't done one in a couple years. so me and my partner chose to do the presentation on a skunk, it had to be an animal, and it really didn't take us long to do it so I quickly ran over and printed a picture of skunk because the teacher said that if you have visual aids it's helpful.

&#x200B;

My brother actively made me see that I was not always right. and it started me on a path of hypersensitivity to communication theories and equality.

Sadly my brother is a giant jerk now, and has tons of confirmation bias and selective reasoning.  IMO He has grown to be a giant bully himself effectively isolating himself from the family because he has a complex about being wrong. This complex makes it hard for him to develop real relationships and trust people. 

He has a girlfriend now that he loves and is helping him through these issues. still, My fear is that his girlfriend just promotes and enables this behavior and that they will grow into a toxic but loving couple. 

&#x200B;

Bullying and psychology and very complex topics. I think that we as modern human beings are constantly being empowered by technology and knowledge to better ourselves and become more than the sum of past experiences. 

&#x200B;

A hard truth that no-one likes to hear is as an adult you alone are responsible for your position and attitudes in life.  Yes there are many many barriers and difficulties of modern life that get in the way and people force themselves into your life and negatively affect it and if you can get around those setbacks you can grow. Understanding your position is a first step to changing it. 

&#x200B;

The biggest piece of advice i have is that most states of mind are temporary. Something i started to truly understand in my 20's.

&#x200B;

Yes i hold myself responsible for the way my brother developed. But I have no obligation to him as an adult because we were both young kids under 18.  At the same time I have patience for him to reconnect if he can grow past being the bitter isolating piece of shit he is now. Typing that out i understand how that reads. But if you interacted with his cold diminutive, demeaning, and self aggrandizing attitude you might understand. 

&#x200B;

My mom is probably responsible for ""the diminutive, demeaning, and self aggrandizing attitudes"" we have as a family because of her own complicated past. My father was a hard working but indifferent man, socially awkward and scared by selfish actors in his own life. My older sister although she was always seen as a peace keeper in the family probably got some weird self serving ego boost every time she was called into arbitrate. Everyone in my family is very selfish, more than average, and these cycles and attitudes are normalized in our culture. It is normalized and validated through capitalistic successes and being able to function in society. Look at me I'm successful therefor I am right. (bad)

ecwl3o0,t3_aakf5f,"One thing to remember about bullying is that it is a social dominance strategy.  Thus, we usually bully those who are members of our social circle -- classmates, work colleagues, family members, etc.  We rarely bully strangers.  There's no benefit, no status to be gained.  It's the same reason we're also kinder to those close to us and apathetic to strangers.

So if, as an adult, you meet your old school bully and he treats you with respect, more than anything it's probably because you no longer register as part of his social circle.  He doesn't compete with you for status, or resources, or control.  Try finding out where your old bully works, and ask his colleagues how he treats them.  I bet you he hasn't shed all his old instincts.  You just don't trigger them anymore.",t3_aakf5f

You don't need that, thing is that confirmation bias tends to pop up when a person just refuses to be open to other possibilities.  This is why many people who pick up the habit of letting bias control their thoughts have to go out of their way to create a scenario that fits this bias or simply avoid the contrary.  Like you said you have the ability but a social anxiety issue hits you in the gut, they know this weakness and will set you up every time.

Either say the hell with them and go online or stand up to them.  The thing about it is that they just simply avoid what doesn't confirm what they think of you even if what you have is as big as a barn.  One good way to handle it is to be direct if they purposely avoid the barn that is in the middle of the room then shove their faces in it.

. The bullying has stopped since I've moved states but when I was still at that school, they would give me the cold shoulder. 

. I went to see the school counsler and she redirected it to the Dean of student wellbeing. I told him I didn't want to be a snitch so he offered to make it seem like a teacher witnessed the bullying happen, which ironically has happened several times, they just didn't bother to report it.

. It lasted about 7-8 months. 

. It's changed me dramatically. I'm really cautious and don't really trust anyone anymore. I've started to lose my appetite and started to sleep in more. I could go into more detail but there's alot. 

. Back in grade three, I did help my friend from bullying but that was really it. My friends though helped me alot throughout my bullying experience. Without them, I would have probably and realistically taken my own life as my parents weren't of help since they bullied me in my homelife. Specifically my father.

. I've never been cyber bullied, unless you count the occasional hate comment from redit. 

. I have had the deep thought before of suicide, however I never really told anyone and I'm clear from suicidal thoughts now.

. My advice is to get support from people you know are actually going to help you in the long run.

. It was really only me he targeted. I still have no idea to this day why him and his friends targeted me.

fana1ec,t3_ea0w90,"- is the bullying stopped?

Yes, but I have encountered more bullying from different unrelated people since it stopped. 

- and how did it stop?

I was being bullied at work and I ended up changing workplaces. I work for a big company across ten locations and have experienced similar bullying at the other stores. 

- how long time did the bullying last?

The original incident lasted approximately 18 months. There is an incident currently ongoing which started about 4 months ago. 

- has the bullying changed you, as a person?

Yes, in many big and small ways. 
I am less extroverted then I used to be. It takes me much longer to trust new people. I can be suspicious of small social interactions that previously I would never have worried about. 

Some ways it has changed me for good. I am more conscientious, I try to be more patient with others. I have learned a lot about communication and how to self manage my emotions. I have learned to identify conflict earlier. 

- have you ever helped others, who was also victims of bullying?

I hope so. I have had many conversations that involve bullying and I try to provide support and insight into the different ways people think, or offer a way that someone could try to address their issues. 

- have you been cyber bullied?

No. 

- have you ever had suicide or self harm thought?

Yes. I have also experienced debilitating bouts of anxiety and depression over the past 10 years. 

- do you have some good advice for others who are victims of bullying, both in real life and on the social medias?

Make records of the events that occur. Record the date, time, any witnesses names, and as much detail as you can recall. Write down the incidents even if you‚Äôre not sure if it fully qualifies as bullying. Start as soon as you notice a pattern with one person. 

Accurate evidence is vital if you want to address the bullying and resolve it. Be prepared to listen fully to the other person and ask them what they would like from you in case they‚Äôre upset by something you‚Äôre doing. Be prepared to question your own behaviour and try to be open to making some changes. 

- what do you think the reason for that others bully others?

In my experience it has been largely due to clashing personalities, misinterpretations & misunderstandings. One of the biggest problems is that people would rather be passive aggressive when they are upset, instead of having an honest conversation about what is bothering them. 

I hope this is helpful :)",t3_ea0w90
fana47r,t3_ea0w90,"Hey I can answer some of these.

The bullying stopped about a year ago

It stopped because a teacher tried to help me. He had meetings with me and my mum and was very strict and tried to sort things. It took a long time. I have a whole post on how it was sorted (best way to solve bullying) on this page on reddit if you wanted to read that

The bullying has extremely changed me, in a lot of ways. I have half the confidence I had before, I have been depressed and now I have an anxiety disorder and I can‚Äôt leave my house. I feel like I DEFINITELY wouldn‚Äôt have these if I wasn‚Äôt bullied. The bullying stopped a year ago but my mental health has gone rapidly bad and I haven‚Äôt left my house in the last 5 weeks. I don‚Äôt have any friends. I don‚Äôt have a social life. I don‚Äôt go to school anymore. I stopped going to school in March because of my mental health. I failed 6 out of 10 subjects because of how much being bullied distracted me from my learning. You are never in the right mindset to learn because you are walking into a classroom expecting to be humiliated and picked on for a whole hour. I used to have things thrown at when the teacher wasn‚Äôt looking. 
I was a straight A student but I failed MOST of my subjects and was really emotionally broken by it. My teachers all felt for me as well. You need to pass 5 subjects to get into college, and I passed 4. I only JUST got in because they let me. 
One bully cost me an entire subject!!!!!!!!! It was my favourite subject too.
I have a whole detailed post on how bullying changes a person if you would like to read that. I can send you it if you want. 

Yes I have been cyber bullied. I was cyber bullied twice. Once was by a complete stranger who cyberbullied me for 9 months, tried to manipulate me, blackmailed me, made fun of me, was racist to me and was horrible. We reported this to CEOP.
The second.. case of it was when I was bullied on social media for 4 years in high school. Every year, probably every week, people from school teased me online. People new I was fun to be horrible to so they used to make group chats and add me just to have a source of entertainment. I have a twin sister, and one time, looking for something to pick on me for, this girl send a picture of my twin from HER Instagram and a picture of me from MY Instagram. So it was a picture of each of us, and she said ‚ÄúLook! (My name) used (my twin)‚Äôs picture!!! They look the same! She thought she wasn‚Äôt pretty enough so she had to use her twins picture!‚Äù And they all were really really horrible to me on this group chat and in lessons for the rest of the week. I was just thinking ‚Äúwe‚Äôre identical twins you moron‚Äù. People made memes and posts about me that were really extremely mean. And this girl sent me video circles on snapchat saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such a R_TARD you‚Äôre literally SOOOO WEIRD! You have NOOO friends like you have NO fucking friends you psycho bitch.‚Äù And it was worse than that, there were like 7 of these video circles, and I showed them in person to a police officer

I self harmed in March. I never thought to do it while the bullying was happening for 4 years but a lot of people do. It was still the effect of the bullying that caused me to do it. I have had suicidal thoughts from about then til now. In my post about the effects bullying has on people I talk more about why bullying makes someone feel this way. 
If you are a bully victim you are far far less likely to open up about your mental health. No one at school knows how badly I am affected by what they did to me. I haven‚Äôt told them because I think if I did they would be the same as they were before and say I was ‚Äúattention seeking‚Äù or something which would just harm me even more.
For me a big attribute was the fact that at school I was told ‚ÄúNo one likes you‚Äù daily. ‚ÄúLEAVE!‚Äù this boy would shout when I entered the common room, ‚ÄúNO ONE WANTS YOU HERE!‚Äù He would actually cup his hands around his mouth and shout loudly and everyone would laugh and the point was to announce my presence to the whole room so everyone would look and I would ‚Äúget the message‚Äù and leave and then they would laugh about it. No one ever stood up for me either.
So I had an immensely strong feeling that no one would care if I wasn‚Äôt there. Also in the summer holidays when I was 15, I used to sit in the car and think about opening the door and throwing myself onto the motorway. We had to meet with the Deputy Head IN the summer holidays because I was so TERRIFIED about going back to school. I would have rather died than go back. And that is serious. When I went back to school I had the worst possible start to the year imaginable. I came home and cried on the first day. Then also on the second day I sobbed my eyes out. I remember I cried when I came home every day for 3 weeks. It was so miserable. Also I told no one this but I had problem relating to going to the toilet the days before I went back to school, because of the absolute distress and terror I was in and how anxious I was about going back to school and facing those people. This was really embarassing and I cried a lot. Stress affects your body and can make you physically unwell. Bullying has made me unwell in different ways before.

Also, I developed a voice problem called Muscle Tension Dysphonia due to the stress. It meant the whenever I was angry, upset or anxious the muscles in my throat would get really really tight (even if I wasn‚Äôt using my voice! Just purely by how I felt) and would damage my voice because of the strain. I couldn‚Äôt sing for 2 years. I had ‚Äúlost my voice‚Äù for 2 years and my speaking voice was really low which as a girl I hated. I was in 4 choirs and had to leave them. I was heartbroken over not being able to sing.. it was really really a very difficult time for me. My voice was hoarse and sometimes I would wake up and almost not be able to speak. This wouldn‚Äôt have happened for 2 years if I wasn‚Äôt bullied.

Advice for bullies:
In the moment: Try your hardest not to say something back because this harms your defence. It really does. E.g. you wouldn‚Äôt want to use screenshots if you said something back to them in the screenshot. And it may look like you were enjoying the drama as much as they were and were trying to keep it going. 
The best thing is a ‚Äònot bothered‚Äô attitude. Then hopefully they will realise they can‚Äôt fucking alter you or offend you and will leave you alone. I liked just turning up to school and being like ‚ÄúOhhhh you thought I was gonna stop coming to school because of you, oh no sweetheart you don‚Äôt matter that much to me‚Äù lmaooo ‚Äúalright have a good day‚Äù ahah. 
It would really annoy them if you just SEEMED to not be affected and they will give up sooner.
Also a good thing is to have a ‚Äòyikesss‚Äô attitude to them. Like with a proper facial expression. Just be like ‚Äúoh my god you‚Äôre really *wasting your time* by talking to me/writing that/being mean/criticising people?‚Äù Just be like ‚Äú..yikes dude.‚Äù Or hell, straight up say to them ‚Äúyour life must be really boring if you have to constantly pay so much attention to me / pick on other people.‚Äù 

Or comment on their obsession with you. I used to be like ‚ÄúWhat is your deal about me? Like... why do you think about me every day.. and look for me on the field at lunch..... it‚Äôs so stalkery! You‚Äôre OBSESSED with me.‚Äù But have SUCH a ‚Äúyikes‚Äù attitude to it. It will embarass them. If you implied you were going to tell people of this they would probably get embarrassed and want to leave you alone.
Avoid implying they fancy you or they are gay and in love with you because this can be misconstrued as you using being gay as an offence lol. Just be careful there. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúdo you fancy me or something?!‚Äù to try and get them to leave you alone. There are better ways to do it.

Long term advice: tell a teacher. As soon as possible. I have a post on advice on how to do it best. You might be like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way I can do that‚Äù but... trust me <3

Question: what do you think is the reason people bully others?
My answer: 
Popularity. Always (from MY experience.) it was never ACTUALLY about me it was about them. For example, one time something embarassing happened to this girl in my class and she lied and said it was me. It wasn‚Äôt about putting me down it was about her saving herself from embarassment and lying. I know it may not always seem like it, but bullies care more about putting themselves UP than you DOWN.
It‚Äôs about image, popularity, getting clout, becoming important in school. 
I‚Äôve never understood why people bully. It can end lives. They are truly, truly evil and it is NEVER justified. It is NEVER the victim‚Äôs fault, bullying is NEVER okay.

fane41v,t3_ea0w90,"The bullying happens once in a while. It really hasn't stopped. The bullying bas been happening for 12 years by different people in multiple grade levels and it destroyed my mental health. It changed everything from my personality to my beliefs and even how i dressed. I used to have a healthy amount of self esteem and wouldn't wear ugly clothing to hide my body because I thought I would always look hideous no matter what. I've been physically assaulted, laughed, made fun of, etc for 2/3rds of my Life but nobody cared about me. Even the teacher joined in bullying me because it was funny to see me cry and have flashbacks. Everyone loved to pick on me so there wasn't any other victims of bullying, it was just me. After being depressed for many years I bought myself a phone to cope with feeling rejected and lonely thinking that I would never be bullied on the internet. I was so damn wrong. Whenever I played, other players would harass me everytime I login. It got so bad i had to uninstall half of my apps because it got that far.
After my first attempt had gone wrong I started to self harm again. This time I hurt myself by cutting instead of lacerating my forehead or ""accidently"" falling on the sidewalk, or breaking a window, or even hitting my head really hard until I bleed. Also, I didnt have any emotional support or friends so I became depressed. The counselors pretended to care about my situation....",t3_ea0w90

- i am a completely different person. when it just began i was the most confident bubbly witty kid - they broke me and i had to rebuild myself. now i have way more anxiety , an occasional stutter , if a group of people raise their voice/yell at me i will go into panic mode and frantically apologise

f9h49in,t3_e51ym4,"Wish I could help with this. Sometimes it's best to get a lawyer involved and have them discuss the state's bullying laws (if any) or harassment laws to the school's administrator. Maybe have your parents threaten to sue the school if this continues. Some schools don't want to receive the negative type of attention and that will get their butts up and actually do something. Wish there was something else to help, but schools are like a battle ground between students, teachers, administrators and even the state's politicians. 

I live in Baltimore, MD and the schools here are hopelessly underfunded and understaffed with students that have attitude problems and the mental health system often fails the students. I've dealt with cases where students attacked teachers because of the teacher talking back or so. Many teachers have filed lawsuits against the education system for failing to protect them and even the students.

Here in NYC, the charter schools claim to cater to everyone but the reality is that they want 'special kinds of everyone.'

The school will not take much action and even if they do, it might instigate further bullying. It might temporarily help to stop bullying only at the cost of fear of punishment, which in my opinion is not effective in the long term. Letting the bullies hear how they‚Äôre making your brother feel right from his mouth might make them more empathetic. Perhaps you could suggest that your brother is given a chance to talk to these bullies one-on-one to really have a vulnerable ‚Äúspeech‚Äù on how they‚Äôre making him feel. If the bullying does stop, it would be out of empathy which would be a much more permanent solution. Of course, there‚Äôs no guarantee that they would be empathetic, but it‚Äôs maybe worth a shot.

f9k2vbr,t3_e51ym4,"I am assuming that hone schooling is not an option in this case. So, since the school has been approached several times and shows no inclination to help. It is time t take it to the local school board. Going over the principal's head might upset him. But so what. He had his chance to take action and chose not to. If the school board does not seem to be receptive then do not hesitate to take it top the state education agency. But let me warn you. You will probably get all kinds of pushback the higher you go. Just keep in mind why you are doing it. You need to be more persistent than they are. 

The other kids that are bullying him are doing it because they are under the mistaken belief that this shows how powerful they are. They have learned this tactic from some other member of their family. There is nothing that you can do about this. But there are several things you can do. Number one is to work on his sense of True Self Confidence. This type of self confidence is based upon accomplishments. Not upon being praised for being honest, or responsible. or anything else. Yes, these are important. But they would do very little to help his self confidence. I am talking about things he does. It could be something as simple as playing checkers. When he becomes good at that then move on to something else. Over time his self confidence WILL improve. 

You might also try to help him find one or two friends that will stick up for him when the bullies try to start ragging on him. This type of person is called an upstander. Not every child can do this. They have to be pretty self confident in their own right. But the effort to find one or two of these people can be well worth the effort.",t3_e51ym4

It is a serious problem and needs to be addressed right now. The longer you let this go the worse it is going to get. I have been dealing with the issue of bullying for more than 60+ years. So I have seen just about everything you can imagine when it comes to this issue. The older a bully gets the worse his life is going to become. You can't even begin to imagine what a seriously negative effect this will have on him as he gets older.

You just have to learn how to survive and fight back. And of course how you go about doing that will vary greatly depending on the situation.

At the end of the day don't let bullies steal your joy and happiness. And don't let these experiences corrupt you.

I was bullied very heavily when I was in Elementary and Middle School.  My social skills weren't that great, and I was diagnosed with Asperger's.  

In retrospect, I was probably an annoying kid who violated social norms.  I was virtually never in a position of social power, but for many on the outside looking in it must have looked like an assholish kid getting what he deserved.  Between that observation and the sheer aversion of admitting anything that resembles that a bullied party did anything wrong makes me doubt that some people can even recognize that kind of bullying when they aren't themselves the victim.",t3_btbquf

Since it was the all knowing teachers that said this I took it to heart and now I can't interact normally with anyone. I select what type of person I am depending on what group/person I'm interacting with, I don't really know who I am for real.

if I meet someone for the first time I just adapt a bland neutral stance until I'm able to determine what type of person I'm dealing with. yes it leaves me with a lot of friends, some of which are really close, but I can never honestly talk about myself as it always goes through a filter. it's exhausting and I'm deadly afraid people will notice and leave me alone again.

If I don't like something that someone is doing I say it outright and I get the same treatment of people looking at me like I've landed from another planet. I'm 29, I've come to the point where I'm glad when people show me this poor behaviour so I can cut them out of my life instead of leaving them there to cause real problems in my life later on. I think of them as an unhealthy and unavoidable part of society, and I have the option to leave it as it is, ask the disease to be courteous to me or I can cut them out of my life and get on with my own. It can get lonely, it was tough for me initially. But in the long run it has served me well, slowly I found people whom I can respect and who respect me in return. Not just that, but everyday I care less and less about what people think while my self-esteem has gone up leaps and bounds. Staying open to new people after so many bad experiences was the toughest part. Keep pushing through my friend :) Keep fighting for your self-respect and your dignity.

ejbzg8l,t3_b4zn4m,"They are doing it because you let it happen. I was very self-aware and had tendencies to self-isolation and -mutilation. I was so anxious that I was too afraid of going to the gym alone or even asking my parents if they allow it as I was still a teenager back then. It's gotten to the point where I had several mental breakdowns, dropped out of school etc. But that's where everything took a turn. Much for the better, but also much for worse.

I learned that no one gave 1 shit how I felt. My parents were too occupied trying to get a job for me when all I needed was some rest. My 'friends' from school did not ask once (ok, it was exactly once) how I felt & psychologists and psychiatrists see this as a huge opportunity to get every last cent they can with you because they tell you they can help you. I learned the hard way that I am alone in this world. I've been bullied for 8 years straight (until I entered high school, then I was still an outsider but nor bullied because I had 0 social skills until 18). The bad things that happened from this: I lost all ambition to be successful in this life. I did not have a plan for the future anyways and probably won't in the future. I suffered from severe disassociations (Derealisations/Depersonalisation) & panic attacks daily (the disassociation non-stop for a year) and still get flashbacks from time to time.

People always say go to the gym, build muscle and you'll get respect, but that's not true at all. I did it for 2 years at that point in time and am quite muscular. Maybe that is a reason why I wasn't a target for bullying in HS anymore, but no one really liked me anyways. I got ignored and weird looks when I tried to talk to someone regularly. BUT in this situation and what I'v elearned from it I was so happy that I sticked to it. The best/worst thing I got from this is my hatred against everything and everyone, or rather how inhuman this society really is. In this constant state of Dissociation all I wanted was help and I didn't get it, so what could I do? Break through the cycle with full force. I still took a year to recover, but I learned so much and my life turned to the better generally. I started not giving a shit and just do what I want. No one believed in me anyway, no one liked me anyways, no one wanted to help me anyways, so what did I have to lose? 0. I always wanted to be in a band, but how can someone who is too afraid to ask their parents if I can sign up to the gym possibly do that? I can't play an instrument or sing for shit, so step 1 was to learn, [and this is me only 2 years later, one of the most talented distorted vocalists in town.](https://youtu.be/dNzCZgQOhb8) If you asked me if I ever shared a stage with a 1/2 Million monthly listener band on spotify I'd ask you if you were crazy back then, now it is only 4 months away from reality.

Now, what does that have to do? I wanted to underline a point here. Doing what you love gives you confidence and with confidence true friends come naturally. Only since a few weeks I have friends I do things weekly. We're all part of the same scene and I feel like to get true friendship in this plastic world you need to be part of a scene, preferably a scene that is at least somewhat anti-establishment. If you take acting classes just stick wit hit, maybe go into a different group where your work is valued and change some habits in your every day life. You might have this 1 thing you always wanted to do but never did like it was music for me. Just fuck it and go for it. If you like acting then maybe music is also something for you. Try to get into a scene. New Wave, Metal, Punk, does not matter. You're acting skills can help you even there. Or literally just any other thing that can give you confidence is what you really need. But I never had 1 friend that was just ""normal"" because they always talked bad behind my back. Now, I am still a looser with a job that does not pay as much, no ambition to suceed in life or anything but I laugh at these people driving their expensive cars working 12/6 because at the end of the day I get more joy of receiving a signed CD from South Korea for 20$ than they with their 500000 cars ever will have probably. Once you get into that mindset everything else just sort of ""happens"". It's crazy. But trust me, a few weeks ago I was sitting alone at home all the time waiting for the next practice after work to just do something, now I join band practices from bands all around the area just for fun and have a circle of friends who meet up for activities on several days a week. Something I was never able to pull off for 20 years of trying.",t3_b4zn4m
ejmib7y,t3_b4zn4m,"Because bullies never go away. No one bullied me in high school as everyone fear me. They all thought I was destined to be the next Columbine and so not a single person dared to even talk to me. But here's the reality, I dealt with bullies at every job I worked at, through CDL school and throughout my career. Bullies dont go away. You just have to learn how to deal with them better. 

You get stronger, confident, smarter, more respected and more resilient. Or you dont. At every point in your life, bullies will always exist. The best solution I've found to them is improve at your trait to the point where bullying you is a good way to develop enemies. Respect in powerful places is a damn good way to disway bullies.",t3_b4zn4m
ejag7dl,t3_b4zn4m,"You gotta look tough. 

1)Hit the gym so you get big muscles. 

2) do knuckle push ups and eventually you'd be able to punch steel with little to no pain. Also whack your shins with a stick until they go numb. 

3) Walk around stomach in chest out. 

4)talk in deeper manlier voice. 

5) shave your head. Crew cut or flat top. And grow your beard so you look like duck dynasty. 

6) learn muai Thai or jujitsu or kyokushin karate. 

7) go in the range and practice shooting.

g2gfgfa,t3_ieh7ii,"Healing has nothing to do with revenge, it is about overcoming the trauma and dealing with the fallout.

A thirst for revenge would for me, maybe (I am not a professional) indicate the intrusion cluster of PTSD, meaning thoughts about your trauma continue to bubble up and evoke very strong emotional reactions, sometimes even adrenal response and fight or flight.

The need for revenge is just a rationalization of that, because this kind of emotional load has to be dealt with some way. What I would advise: Seek trauma informed therapy, and when these strong feelings bubble back up, accept what is happening to you, where it comes from, and give yourself the time needed to come down. See it more as a natural disaster, it's not intended, nobody is to blame (for your symptom, of course these fucks are to blame for what they did to you), so you deal with it. Then, and you should start with that now, explore options to calm you down. Can be sports, running, lifting, bodyweight excercises, shadowboxing or hitting the bag (not walls, unproductive), can be listening to loud music and really immersing yourself in it, can be playing a video game, eating something good (a good steak calms me down,  for example) you'll find out, try out many things.

g2gomv9,t1_g2gknlz,"I can't really answer that, I am not a professional.
I would wager, that by fantasizing about revenge, you are focusing the emotional load behind what you lived through. Like sun shining through a magnifying glass.
Another aspect, and I am projecting this from myself, think about if that fits you, it is giving you a sense of control over your emotions. Anger feels better than sadness, lonelyness, dread or just pure emotional white noise, because you are a too flooded to feel anything really. So rather you feel anger, which is a very driven and potent emotion, that eggs you on to do things. That is why I tend to become angry, that is also when I start self harming and punch walls, or smash my head into them. 
If fantasizing about revenge makes you feel worse, or threatens to make you spiral out of control, so that you harm yourself or someone else, try doing something else than fantasizing about that.",t3_ieh7ii

You said that you are still bullied so now there is a chance to do something about it. You should find someone you trust, it should be an adult, but it doesn't have to. Depending on your relations with other people you can talk to your parents, grandparents, anyone else from family or even some teacher that you like.

Maybe try making friends here on Reddit? It's easy to find people who share the same hobbies here thanks to subreddits. Do what you like to do, keep yourself busy, think about something nice, find somebody who will listen to you, find some place where you can share what you are doing (depending on what you are interested in).

Those bad people that you met in your life will mostly not even realise that they did something wrong, mostly because they were treated in the same way in the past. Many bullies were actually bullied in the past, many times by someone who was pretending to be their friend, that's why they are bullying others instead of behaving normally and trying to find some friends. Even if someone will realise, they will not admit most of the times and just keep bullying others.

Like I said before, you should try to forget about them and keep yourself busy. If something bad happens, get the proof and don't give attention to those people. It can be difficult at the beginning, but it will be easier later. Just show that you don't care and they will move to another person most of the time. If someone will not move then you have to help them by reporting them. I wish you the best and I hope that everything will be fine.",t3_ie1t6a

fz659a7,t3_hxf913,"Hey, I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through a difficult time at school. These people sound so awful. Such ugly, ugly behaviour from them. I was bullied very badly at high school so I can understand what it‚Äôs like. They are bullying you because of their own issues, you don‚Äôt deserve a single second of it.

They are probably targeting you because you‚Äôre a good person and it will make them feel better about themselves if they can make you feel worse about yourself. Bullies are threatened by brilliant people, so in a weird way it‚Äôs a compliment. They see themselves as superior and feel the need to pick on the best people and bring them down to raise their profile. There‚Äôs one way to get back at bullies and that‚Äôs by being happy and successful. To heal, forgive and love yourself is the best revenge. These despicable people who treat you like this are likely very sad. No one 100% in love with their life wants to bully another person. 

One thing you can do for yourself which is like a sort of defence shield in a way, is you can know your own truth. Because the bullies are going to try and make you think things about yourself. That is their whole goal. They want you to think you‚Äôre the problem (when actually it‚Äôs just their own issues). They want you to think that you‚Äôre not likeable. It‚Äôs very important that you know this is absolute bullshit üíö. Bullies are manipulative and they are liars. They are mentally messed up anyway because they are resorting to pushing someone down to try and feel better about themselves. They are gonna try and make you feel bad, and like you‚Äôre not a good person. It is so so so so important to know this is a lie. It‚Äôs essential for your mental health that deep down you know in your heart and always understand that there is nothing wrong with you, no matter what they tell you. Know that you are amazing (and all the other good qualities you are) and these people are just insecure and their words do not mean anything. They are liars who are just pathetically trying to be unkind. 

It is really helpful to know these truths: 

1) I am too brilliant, kind and amazing that these insecure people can‚Äôt resist trying to hurt me because of their own insecurities 2) I am worth so so much and I am in love with the person I am and I don‚Äôt need to change 3) the bullies‚Äô words are meaningless and empty. Their words stem from a place of jealousy and unkindness and aren‚Äôt accurate. The bullies‚Äô words about me are not true and therefore have no power over me. 4) these bullies have little to no matter to me. They are not important to me. Therefore I do not value what they say about me. 5) I pity the bullies for wanting to put so much of their energy into being toxic and being so negatively obsessed with me.

Instead of choosing to believe the horrible things the bullies were saying about me like I wasn‚Äôt likeable, I wasn‚Äôt enough - I chose to believe these things ^ because these are the statements that are true and the bullies‚Äô taunts are so inaccurate and pathetic that they‚Äôre not worth anyone‚Äôs time. 

A really good idea, if you haven‚Äôt done it already, is to tell the school. There are ways to go about it where you won‚Äôt look like a snitch (also it‚Äôs not actually being a snitch- snitching is when the thing doesn‚Äôt affect you, like if people steal from school and you tell on them, but when it does affect you it‚Äôs not snitching, it‚Äôs getting help). You and your parent can email the teachers and talk about it and if the teachers speak to the bullies, they can tell the bullies that ‚ÄúA member of staff has found out and told me that...‚Äù. Teachers intervening is how my bullying was ultimately stopped for good. My mum and I would report the incidents to the teacher through email, saying which teachers were nearby, the Deputy Head would bring the bullies into his office, tell them he‚Äôd heard word of the bullying from staff, shout at them and tell them to leave me alone or else they would be straight back in that office. The bullies tested it a little bit for a few weeks but then left me alone and it was over. 

For support, a really good service is Childline. It‚Äôs great. I think the fact it‚Äôs called ‚ÄòChild‚Äôline and not something more adult sounding puts people off lol. I called Childline for the first time the other week and a counsellor named Sue answered and was extremely nice and understanding and spoke to me for a good 40 minutes. It was so nice to speak to a stranger, and someone who really listened and understood me. Now I‚Äôve called it once, I‚Äôll definitely do it again. There is also the 1-2-1 counsellor chat on the website. And of course, all of this is confidential. Another way you can get support (if you‚Äôre in the U.K.) is emailing Samaritans. Now, the phone number is for crisis situations, but the email is for anything! It doesn‚Äôt have to be crisis. You can email jo@samaritans.org and a volunteer who will use the name Jo will answer. You can write paragraphs about anything you‚Äôre going through and your feelings, and you will get a reply. It is completely confidential and they can give you advice and support.

My last advice would be to just try to stay positive, stay hopeful and know that none of these people will matter in a few years time. Also, by all means, take days off school if it will be best for your mental health, but don‚Äôt stop going like I did; it has really put a spanner in the works. Just focus on your GCSEs, practice self care and do things you enjoy. Things are going to be so good so soon just hang in there and don‚Äôt worry about it too much. Keep being great and remember how dope you are. üíö

What I think can help is to find good friends. Not the friends who won't friend with you, because some idiots make fun of you, but thru, real friends that will be there for you.   
This is not easy, it takes a lot of time to find good people around you, but to find good, you need to present yourself as a good individual.

fzamuav,t3_hxf913,"I really disagree with the other redditor saying that you are being targeted because you are a good person, the reason is because you allow it, if a girl tells you something you can be mean to her it's okay, if a boy tells you something you can kick his ass, for real, there is a reason why nobody picks on the cool guys or those who are willing to fight. Look, you are being a coward, and let me tell you this, you won't be strong enough to control yourself when all the accumulated hate and sadness explodes into a massive wrath.   


Let me explain you my story, I was bullied, yes, just by one person every time, but it ended quicker and quicker every fight I fought,  I lost 3 of these 5 fights hahahah, one was like a draw, and the other one was my only  victory, but let me tell you something even if I lost I won, those guys stopped their harassment because even if you lose, punches really hurt, even if you don't have the chance to punch them they will know you will fight back, and they are cowards, that's why the pick on guys like you that don't defend themselves.  


My last fight was a win, and it ended real fast, literally two punches, what happened? I stopped restrained myself. The most dangerous fighter is not the stronger but the willing to die in combat.  


""But I can't fight!"" you could say, and my answer is ""nonsense, everyone can fight"" I'm a fighter and let me tell you, you can fight, your body is capable of being a beast, but your mind is restrained it.

I implied that they are homophobic. Don't worry, they are shit. In middle school, everybody think the boy is gay if he plays with girls or don't play what the majority of the boys play.

But naturally, I'm told that I'm very kind, and I usually am that way, it's just that kind people tend to be very easy to take advantage of.

fhxw76a,t3_f53a3k,"In addition to what others said earlier, even if the bully really is confident and fun to be around, people's judgments on which traits are valuable are confused at best, outright distorted at worst.  

They they fail to see several things:

* Strength, power, confidence, backbone, etc., no matter how impressive or even necessary, says nothing about whether that person will hurt, harm, or degrade others.  In fact, all those traits can be used for bad, even evil, purposes as well as for good ones.  
* The opposite traits also say nothing about whether the person would set out to be dishonest, petty, judgmental, exploitative, or abuse their power if they got into a position of power. 
* Fundamental misunderstanding of what leadership is.  They confuse motivation with intimidation, actual know-how with a confident presentation style, ***justified*** confidence with bravado, and charisma with likability. *Actual* leadership involves inspiring trust in others (leaders and co-workers alike), creating a climate where employees can feel confident expressing new (even unconventional) ideas about how to do things and what the team should do, clear and defined goals without arbitrary changes, being responsive to worker's grievances and general looking out for their own legitimate interests, constructive feedback (i.e. without disparagement), and teaching workers better ways of doing things without disparaging their competence. There's others, but you get the idea. 

Their friends themselves' values and attitudes are just as botched as the bully's. You can definitely judge people by the company they keep. A person reveals their values and priorities by who they nominate as their heroes and role models.  This spills over into their choice of friends.  And this assumes they are their loyal, sincere friends.

It gets worse when it comes to cynical motives.  Those ""friends"" are not so much friends as they are allies - they orbit around the bully because of the benefits they get (or think they do) by associating with the bully (status, sex, money, glory, a photogenic social life, excitement in life they can't find on their own without the bully; or even out of fear or the bully's disapproval). You see this all the time among ""in crowd"" type groups.

1)This might sound rather strange, but most importantly, practice intensively sports, you have to come back home really tired from physical activity. If you don't like team sports, you can always pick up swimming. But this is the most important single thing. Sports will improve you in many ways, not only emotionally but also socially. (You rarely see shy awkward guys who practice sports).

2)Talk to your parents, talk to your teachers, talk to your Councillors. Bullying is a serious emotional abuse which can have consequences for life.

3)If you can't make friends at school, or at sports, look for an activity outside school where you interact with like-minded people and where you can make friends. A group of friends outside of school, is the best way to disable the bully's capacity to isolate you, since your new friends are out of his reach.

f9tvnzk,t1_f9oz549,"One thing that really worked for me is that I'm such a huge crier. And they felt really bad and someone told the teacher for me, so they felt worse. I also told everyone ""im sorry I'm weird."" So they felt like they deserved the punishment even more. 

Don't try to manipulate people like me though! be sincere that it bothers you. Tell one of the bullies calmly that what they said was mean. And you can't help being different. Try to smile a little as you walk away.",t3_e6ad01
f9p07bo,t1_f9oz549,"Please definitely tell your parents. If they don't know how bad you were feeling back then, tell them about it now. They should understand the extent of your feelings. 

Also tell them about what is happening now. You said its starting up again, like you anticipate things will get worse, but really you dont know. And having that fear and anxiety can affect how you come across to others, even on accident. Like people might easily misinterpret you.. For example, if you are hesitant to be friendly, they might think you don't like them, when its more that you are afraid of how they will react to you. So then, they might treat you like someone who doesn't like them. Then it just snowballs with each side making misunderstandings. This isn't the cause of all bullying, but it can get in the way of you making new friends that can shield you from being a target.

So please let your parents know everything. Also consider talking to school counsellor.

If you feel in danger or threatened then be sure to tell teachers right away.

Also talk to your friend and gf about it. Its good to share. Plus chicks dig sensitive guys who share their feelings hehe.",t3_e6ad01

I guess I‚Äôll be in class and then I‚Äôll like start thinking how bad 5th grade was, and how i definitely should‚Äôve told and adult again. Like I‚Äôm sure people have it way worse than I do but still I can‚Äôt get over it, and I‚Äôve been asked to just forgive and forget but honestly I can‚Äôt forgive nor forget. I bet they are decent people now but i won‚Äôt forget maybe ever...",t3_e6ad01
f9pvvb9,t1_f9p8298,thanks for your kind words and advice :).,t3_e6ad01
f9p7qzx,t1_f9p0iwh,"It matters less who have it worse, and more how you feel about it. Like everyone has different tolerance levels, and its ok. 

If you can forgive and forget thats great.. Mostly because it benefits you to do that. It frees up space in your mind to concentrate on school and hobbies and your future and even socializing and good stuff. Its best to concentrate on these things that build you up and help you set up a good future for yourself, and it might help you get over things faster too...But if you are having a hard time doing it, you should talk about that, especially if its an obstacle to you. 

But you are not alone having a hard time getting over bullying. It can count as a legit trauma with ptsd and everything. If you look through this reddit you'll see theres adults that still think about it and some still feel really trapped by it. Nevermind about who had it ""worst"".. Its just about experiencing something that felt overwhelming to you. Just like for them its about how their specific experiences felt overwhelming to them. They were probably told (or told themselves) that they should just get over it. Its never too late (like 4 years ago is not too long ago), but sooner is better, for getting these things off your chest. You really are not alone in feeling like you do. 

I can tell you.. The earlier you get this addressed, the better it will be for you.  Let your folks know how you are having a hard time letting go. Show them this post, even. Even if they dont do anything right away, i am sure they will want to know how you are feeling. You can also try the school counsellor. Just to start talking, and give them a baseline. 

 You do seem like a nice guy with a level head. I think in the end you will be fine. But do take care of yourself. Concentrate on school and extracurriculars to build yourself up. Keep being you.. But talk to your folks more. Good luck!",t3_e6ad01
f9txryk,t1_f9p0iwh,"Well in that case make everyone feel really bad since you're moving. I'd tell the worst bully in front of everyone ""I'm sorry I'm weird! I just wanted to have friends! I'm moving schools now!""

f7egbhr,t3_dvm7i9,"This is great advice! I used to be bullied a lot in high school and would have loved to hear this.

I‚Äôm a substitute educator at a school district now and one thing from what you said that came across was the ‚Äúsnitching‚Äù. 
I actually had a kid in my class who said something about someone being a snitch. I said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe in snitching.‚Äù They go, ‚Äúyeah! Me neither!‚Äù I go, ‚ÄúNo, I don‚Äôt think snitching is real.‚Äù They looked at me surprised. I followed up with my comment, ‚ÄúSnitching does not exist. Snitching is telling on someone because it does not effect you, if it effects you and you tell on them, then it‚Äôs getting help.‚Äù

f7em6jo,t3_dvm7i9,"That‚Äôs good advice, but as a former victim of bullying; it‚Äôs not that easy.

I finally broke down to my mother and told her I was being bullied. She contacted the school without my knowledge and I found myself being pulled out of class to report to the office. I was then directed to the guidance counselor who told me he got a phone call with concern regarding the bullying.

He asked for names, but I wouldn‚Äôt give him any. I don‚Äôt think I was afraid of retaliation, but rather the humiliation I would feel that I had to have someone else fight my battles for me.

Time to put on your parent boots and be very honest with him too about boundaries and respect for self and others. Maybe even tell him about what kids did to you as a child and why it hurt you, and maybe he will see why his actions are hurting someone else.
Talk to him about how hurting other kids will also hurt him in the long run because it will push friends away and possibly anger another child who could get physical with him, tell him you don‚Äôt want to see anyone get hurt especially him.",t3_dsnsqw

You did nothing to deserve such poor treatment. I'd like to say you can even the score and right it somehow, but it'd be untrue. They got away with it. Question is, how do you plan on moving forward?

I used to get positive attention for my personality but now it‚Äôs like I want attention for something I‚Äôve never had before. I should start by centering my self slowly because I can get tasks done if I take care of my heath better. I just need to find some motivation I guess.

It's funny because I live in the same town as those girls and when I see them I always greet them out of courtesy and they either turn their face away or reply in a very dry tone and I'm like ""wtf why are they not over it yet?"". 


We always get a lot of talks on bullying but we always get the easy example of the kid who gets insulted and physically assaulted for no reason, which did NOT happen to me, but I always felt like I wasn't treated right either. I'm becoming a high school teacher soon and I wanted to know if this qualified as bullying because if I ever see it happening to a kid I would like to help them seek help and not get their case overlooked because ""that's not bullying"" or something.

And what's more, I hope I can learn how to detect those cases. I'm honestly surprised my case was never addressed, because I spent 6 years in the same high school with the same teachers and it was obvious I was always left out and didn't have any friends (no one ever wanted to team up with me, not being able to name any best friends when asked, being permanently apathetic).

Avoid them as much as possible. Be abrasive and hard to deal with if they try it but never engage in insults. Their ego and sense of shame is so big that they will become vindictive. Something about you triggers their shame. It can be that you simply are a decent human being. They will always be like this. When they move on in life they won‚Äôt all of a sudden become nice. They will still be assholes. But they will always feel they are nice people. 

. You can‚Äôt do anything to change it but stay out of their way. Don‚Äôt let anyone ever drive you to feel that you are not worth it. They are definitive assholes. Like the saying goes. ‚ÄúBefore you diagnose yourself with depression or being crazy check you not simply surrounded by assholes.‚Äù  And you are surrounded. But life moves quickly and you‚Äôll be out of this situation and see it coming a mile off. 

They will always drag around this crap.

People like this can drive people into isolating themselves. Instead please keep building good friendships. Keep busy. Don‚Äôt let yourself be an easy target. Don‚Äôt let them be awful and then you do the rest of the work on yourself by thinking about doing or thinking anything negative about yourself.  

That is the ultimate laziness on their part. They are horrible to you and you finish it off by being cruel to you self.  Don‚Äôt abandon yourself. 

They are not nice that‚Äôs just the simple truth.

Some of these people have mental disorders themselves, which can make them come through as straight up malicious people. These people are just reacting to what happened in their lives or in their heads.. they don't know how to cope with their own situations so they relieve themselves of this trauma by passing it onto the next person. This doesnt stop in school.. this continues well into adulthood and old life. You can see it in the way people behave in companies and politics.. its a rather sad part of human nature.

et44d9y,t3_c9bvsy,"You just as well ask the question ""why are some people so nice?""

Being nice and being mean are two different ways you can get ahead in society.  By being nice, you build trust and gratitude.  By being mean, you can take resources and mates by force from those who are weak.  Either of these strategies can backfire.  Like, maybe you'll be nice to somebody who will never reciprocate, or maybe you'll forgive somebody who will abuse you again.  Likewise, if you're mean you will alienate friends and make enemies.

Being nice can backfire, but most of the time it works, so people who try to be nice whenever they can usually do OK.  That's why niceness is a simple instinct.

Being mean can backfire, but it can work if you use it right.  For instance, mean people often move around a lot, from one job to another and one town to another, so as to get away from enemies and find new suckers.  Mean people tend to be bigoted; it's smarter to victimize outsiders rather than those closer to you.

If meanness was always self-destructive, then natural selection would have weeded it out of the human gene pool by now.  But it survives because it works.",t3_c9bvsy

Correlation is not causation.  If bullies tend to have abusive parents, it's more because they share the same genes that make them prone to bullying.  I've read stories about nice couples who adopted babies out of foster care and the baby turned into a little sociopath despite the parents' best efforts to socialize him.  A lot of babies are abandoned by... shall we say... irresponsible if not criminal mothers.

Sometimes it's parents who inadvertently do that, sometimes its your environment... but one thing's for sure, these feelings start early and follow you around for life. 

I know some people who are almost always full of energy and positive and sociable. Those people automatically believe that everyone is NICE because that's the type of people they gravitate to, so that's the only type of people they talk to/know.

You have gone through a lot for a person so young. Not many other 8th graders can say the same things and that makes you very unique. 

&#x200B;

You have to be brave when you are so unique because there aren't that many people that can show you the way. 

&#x200B;

Don't try to follow or pay attention to those kids. The right people that will add to your life will make themselves known when you least expect it. 

&#x200B;

Being diagnosed bi-polar so young is also hard. It means that your symptoms might be very overt and noticeable. Kids will naturally try to pick apart anything that doesn't seem normal to them. Please ignore them and just understand that kids are idiots. If they are lucky they will grow out of it otherwise they will be idiot adults. 

&#x200B;

My school had a therapist/councilor. I would try to seek them out ASAP and whenever you are feeling too stressed go there. If you aren't allowed, get a doctors note that might allow you to do that only in special cases. 

&#x200B;

If you were properly diagnosed you should have seen a real psychiatrist. Ask them for a list of therapists in the area that specialize in childhood psychology and bipolar disorder. If school continues to be bad ask your doctor or therapist to talk to someone at the school.

Also saw a thread saying she was the one who sparked one of those high school girls' anger by spreading malicious rumor about her parent. Judging from her past behaviors and tendency to speak in very vulgar language, many were convinced she is actually not as innocent as she claims to be. 

&#x200B;

So any updates regarding to this?",t3_bbvsyj
etchhww,t1_esvxoh3,"Hey! Yeah, unfortunately the general media lost interest in the case after her behaviour was exposed so there aren't many updates to the case. But we do know that some of the perpretrators are charged for torment, not all of them since most of them claimed to have just stood by and witnessed the whole thing while mocking the victim, so technically they can't be punished for torment as well.

It was very unfortunate, though, to see how media and netizens quickly turned against Audrey just for how she acts. No matter what, she is still a child and being a bad kid doesn't mean you have to get beat up.

Moreover, people called Audrey out for being a liar. Honestly, I'm torn on that matter. One of the major reasons she got called a liar was because the official medical reports were released and it showed no signs of trauma whatsoever. But the truth is, we also know that she didn't go to police or the hospital right after she got beat up. It was a couple of days before she went and reported the case. Being a young child, your body repairs itself quite well and fast (for lack of better words). We also know that she did have signs of depression as soon as she was admitted to the hospital. Also, the medical reports show no signs of trauma but the police's official statement for the chronological event of Audrey's case clearly stated that torment happened (hence the charges).

Now, I'm torn on the matter because I do feel like they did do things to Audrey (again, hence the charges), but I guess Audrey (or maybe her family) was playing it up to be a way bigger thing than it actually was.

On the part about Audrey being the one who provoked the whole thing, it's really a he-said she-said type of situation and I don't really remember anymore what that whole thing was in conclusion (it's been three months now).

Looking back at it now, it was honestly sad. What Audrey did could potentially make it harder for victims of abuse to come forward, already fearing the slander from the public if one thing comes out about them that isn't all goody two shoes, but also fearing that everyone would just doubt them and point fingers at them for exaggeration. 

But honestly, I still support the cause of this case. The whole point of #JusticeForAudrey was to bring justice for someone who got bullied, and it did just that. Even though at the end both parties went through horrendous internet slander.

Also! I've learnt not to take news at face value. I wrote this post, filled with emotions for the little girl, and I probably stated some things as if they were facts since the news media wrote about it so it muuuust be truuueeee. Well, turns out most of it aren't, haha.

He would talk about Eminem is so poor that he was pressed charge for pointing blank gun at his spouse for cheating. He was memeber of school basketball team and good grade student.

Is it worth it to jeopardise all my progress so far just so I get to hear an apology from him? Is it possible that he has truly changed and is not just virtue signalling this to get a clear conscience?

&#x200B;

I don't know him, but if he is in the all art&music environment, odds are that he is abusing ""mind enhancing"" drugs and which have already taken a toll on his personality.  One of my bullies ended like that, full of peace&love and a <80 IQ.

It‚Äôs not your fault if your sister gets bullied, these people are to blame for it. I know it sounds easier as it is but try to change it, try to do something against the bullying. If you allow them to bully you more and more, you‚Äôll allow them to traumatize you more and more.

1. Bully bait them back.  It's very easy to turn a question back in on itself, doing so can shut them down. 
2. Avoid the bait.  Ignoring such types doesn't work but many times people bully like this because they are searching for a response. Give the opposite response within reason and usually you can avoid the bait.

It can take a while to get past it, but if its something that isn't happening any more, it is best to try to move on. The sooner you get help to get over it the better too. Its like it wastes your energy on the past that should be used for doing things to take care of yourself now, and for your future plans.

Talk about it with a friend. Or your parents. Anyone you are comfortable with. If you can afford it, find a therapist or counsellor to talk to about it.

You could try to talk to the bully about it but I would think about if your happiness with the outcome depends on his reaction. 

Sometimes just saying what is on your mind can help, no matter how the person reacts, because you just want to get your words out there.. But if you need him to be sorry, or understanding, it could make you feel worse. It might even trigger more bullying. Or they might dismiss your feelings or blame you for what happened. So, I would just consider the possible outcomes and if I would be ready for them. You could also talk about this option with the loved one or therapist before deciding.

I‚Äôve only had one apologize. I wasn‚Äôt even looking for an apology from any of them. I just wanted to confront them, and have them acknowledge their past actions so I could get some kind of closure.

Look into things like Rapid Eye Desensitization or tapping to get the feelings of anger out of your system.  You can do some of that on your own.  If not, go see a therapist and get them to help.

f8oyuvo,t3_e1b5kg,"I strongly suggest that you don't seek him out. Giving him a beating could easily get you in legal trouble either with him or with the police, and just confronting him even if you don't intend to physically hurt him could still get out of control. While explaining to him how much he hurt you might possibly get an apology, it is more likely that it would gratify him, as well as giving him the opportunity to bully you some more. The best thing to do is stay away from him. 

This may be harder to handle, but that's the tragedy of bullying--it often continues to hurt people long after it has ended, and the burden to the bullied person is much greater than any possible benefit to the bully. It's unfair, but it's true.",t3_e1b5kg
f8pqkaq,t3_e1b5kg,"Sometimes the only way to get a message across is to actually get something done. I suggest talking to someone but if that does not gratify you and how you feel about your past then go ahead with the beating but at your own risk. I‚Äôm not suggesting to do this but if you do I want you to stay out of legal trouble. Try and set up a meet up somewhere with no cameras (obviously). After that is done use the element of surprise and  make sure to have some sort of bag so you can cover their head with it before the beating so they are not aware of who did it. Once the head is bagged choke them out until they are somewhat disorientated and cannot defend themselves and tie a rope around their neck tight enough so they cannot rip it off( practice the art of tying knots fast). Once the baggy is tied go through with the beating you would like to give. Another reason for the baggy would be that when your are giving blows to the body or face they will only bother to protect those areas which your are attacking and not prioritize the baggy. Once the beating is given run from the alley or wherever and try to stick to other alley ways but do not run as if you are getting away but merely in a hurry. If this is in a neighborhood avoid street lights for traffic cams other than that neighbourhoods are a great place. Remember always to plan out your route of escape as to avoid as little cameras as possible then head home and enjoy the rest of your day. 

Oh yes and bags also muffle the noises of their screams and wear gloves so there is no fingerprints and buy the rope and the bag from separate stores away from each other then proceed with the crime about 6 months later so cameras with footage for rope purchases are would be deleted . In order to prevent the person from calling emergency services smash their phone so they can only make contact at least 10 minutes or more later. Although I gave you a whole step by step there are no details but those are the basics to get away. I agree with this type of behaviour when necessary but I do not expect you to carry this out.

f8qo8vj,t3_e1b5kg,"I feel for you. There‚Äôs a girl who I know is on the spectrum in my Spanish class and Homeroom (I only know she‚Äôs autistic because our mothers are friends, nobody else knows but me I hope).

This girl is really nice and is so sweet, but she is really loud and out there. The people in my Spanish class often make fun of her, and I don‚Äôt think she knows although I did hear her mention how she‚Äôs self conscious a bit when she talks on the phone, so maybe she does know. She mentioned how she has social anxiety and was overall very awkward in our homeroom period today (we have a study hall two days a week). This poor girl got made fun of a lot, but not only girls but boys, and I don‚Äôt think she realized. What they do to her, talk to her like she‚Äôs a child and whisper about her is the EXACT same shit they used to do to me and sometimes still do to me. I feel terrible for this girl because even her own friends do it. I see all the little smirks and whispers because I‚Äôm hypersensitive, it makes me sick, but I‚Äôm guilty of the smirks and shit too unfortunately, I would never do what many others do however. If it matters, we are both 16 and juniors, and I‚Äôm a boy, she‚Äôll be 17 next month but I got awhile to go before 17.

One other thing this girl mentioned in homeroom last week when talking to her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, loud enough for me to hear, was the girl who leads a bunch of clubs and shit who always picks on her, calls her retard and shit. But NOBODY else would guess this about this girl, because of her honor roll status and stuff. I‚Äôve had similar problems with boys too. Jocks who everyone likes but only I know are horrible people, I share my issues with friends and only my friends who have also been bullied share this feeling, but we are almost powerless, nobody believes us. You mentioned that for this kid too, I understand.

While you may want to kick the shit out of this kid, I‚Äôd highly advise that you do not unless he provokes you. There are a lot of kids I want to kick the shit out of, but I have to wait for my time. Wait for your time. I‚Äôm waiting for our gym unit that‚Äôs like floor hockey (not sharing the name due to the fact that our game is local I think), so that I can ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù ram into the same asshole who rammed into me in kickball on the bases for no reason. We are on badminton now, I can‚Äôt hit him, only in ‚Äúfloor hockey‚Äù I can.

Hang in there. I hope you‚Äôre doing alright girl. If you need any help pm me! I‚Äôm an expert on bullying behaviors as I have dealt with bullying since literally the beginning of preschool (thanks Josh who liked to punch me). 12 almost 13 years of experience is a lot but I‚Äôm doing alright.

I had one taller guy in grade 9 that kept bother me, one day he did something and and I snapped and kicked him really hard in the balls, and then went and smashed his woodworking project. I got in trouble but it was far better than the depression I was feeling. I got left alone and felt great.

Try to stay within the law, revenge is a dish best served cold.

maybe one day ou will be very wise and not suggest revenge on bully, but for now it's probably the most important thing you can do.

One of the best revenges might be all legal like tell your story about how he bullies you on social media and tagging his work and places he would not want that out. Most bullies don't want a majority of the world to know they are assholes. Get some legal advice and the write "" how billy deal bullied me and got away with. it. Tell the gorry details, dig up his \[past abuse, get a restraining order, try a lawsuit. Pound tha t fucker you will feel so good for it. Don't listen to scared bully victims, look at strong warriors and follow what they do, crush your bully and turn him into your enemy instead, break his ego so he never dares do it again, suck his last dollar / and leave him feeling worse than you.. than someday repent and be a wiser person, but not now now is the time to plan your total revenge.",t3_e1b5kg
fcs74k1,t3_e1b5kg,"I don't think taking revenge against bullies is the solution, even if having those thoughts is perfectly normal I think, I also dreamed confronting my bully for the pain they brought to me. But, I think the bully would even not remember he treated you like shit, and it could be painful for you if you are not prepared for this. Also, having an autism diagnosis could help you to feel less guilty about not being able to fight back and stand up for your bullies (my late diagnosis really helped me for this point). Then, I think that to feel better, you have to accept what you currently feel, and finally let it go and use this as motivation to get the live you really deserve. Trying to dissect what makes you feel horrible could also help you.

As a bonus point, I'd recommend you to watch how people interact, especially paying attention to body language, along with practicing irony and sarcasm. I would say starting doing this (thank to ""The Mentalist"" TV Show) in high school (long before my diagnosis) really helped me to prevent future bullying.

f87xy30,t3_dyrhzm,"I understand how you feel, you can become so attached after the trauma that it can leave you very empty emotionally.  It can even turn into a dissociative disorder due to emotional disconnect.   How ever this doesn't mean you have become an emotionless robot, you are still human after all.  You just need to be allowed to reconnect with yourself over time and some with some good therapy. 

When I finally left my school I was in the same boat, I was emotionally dead that I couldn't handle positive feedback.  However I was lucky and had a couple of friends that really helped and it took time but eventually, I was able to come around.  You need to find a way to help your self, it can be through therapy or finding positive things to take part in.  Just know that you are capable of healing. 

As for being a sociopath I really doubt it.  Sociopaths know what they are doing is wrong, just that they will find a way to excuse the behavior in basic terms.

I tried to stick with it, but as soon as it turned malicious, and at one point physical, inflation out cut them off. This one jerk really stood out, while others were more or less light-hearted; this prick was just flat out a bad person. But everyone else, as high schoolers do, rode his meat so hard. They went along with it. And my ‚Äúthen‚Äù friend group became just a group of kids who made fun of me. Now, I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore, but I can safely say that, because I cut them off, they haven‚Äôt said much to me.

This can be done by finding something that you have to work at to become better at. It could be school related or just a hobby. If you are athletically inclined it could be either a team sport or something like running or bicycle racing. These require a lot of effort on your part to get better. I did both of these and they really helped my self confidence.

Make the effort to try to understand and connect with people and try out the activities you see them doing. Basically try out new hobbies and interests. Just not bad things like drugs or alcohol and your good. Also learn to small talk, it helps people get comfortable and trust you. Have good grooming habits, that means taking showers, wearing deodorant, brushing/flossing teeth, combing hair, getting haircuts, cutting you nails when they get too long. People don't like being around stinky/dirty people. Not saying you are but things to think about. 

In my experience, I was taught from a very early age to be independent and be my own person. Now, that isn't necessarily a bad thing, but people can and do sometimes take this mindset too far and completely shun/harshly judge society and activities other people do. Kind of a superiority mindset. I think I may have been a bit guilty of this myself at a young age.

I don't know if this is what your doing, but if you go too far with being independent, people will find that insulting and not want to hang out with you. Might even retaliate against the perceived insult.

Yeah, a guy who has endured a bully will become better equipped to deal with bullies in the future, but while the bully is with him in the workplace, he's not getting any more productive.

Think of it like exercise.  The idea behind exercise is that you subject your muscles to stress and in response your body strengthens those muscles.  But in exercise, the stress you subject your body to is carefully regulated.  When you start a gym program, your gym trainer will advise you on what machines to use, how much weight to use, how many reps & sets, how long you should wait to recover, and what your diet should be; all to minimize the risk of injury and maximize gains.  If you don't do it right, you might actually weaken your body through over-exertion or bad form.

But if they realize, know, what they're doing, and are privy to the horrible effects it does to you, and keep on (I had a scumbag 'fake friend' like this as a youth), then it's an issue, and it's something that should be addressed. That is when you can choose or not choose to forgive them.

I understand trust issues and breakdowns. I had them for a long time and I would never wish for someone else to have to go through them. But in the end, the bullies being forgiven or not doesn't affect them. It effects you. If you take anything from my comment it should be this; Unforgiveness affects you more than it will every affect those you choose not to forgive.

That realization was the hardest 2 years of my life. The bullies didn't leave, and I had to clean what little they left of me everytime I was beat the tar out of and it didn't change for 7 years.

I don't know what you went through or what you're going through but I can tell you forgiveness is much more for you than it is for those you forgive. Without forgiveness you'll never trust anyone again, and lack of people to trust leads to overwhelming odds, and inevitably, breakdowns.

It sounds dumb and cliche, but getting over what you went through/go through and the problems that come with is directly linked to your ability to forgive.

Busses are run by a transportation company that's different from the school. But if you do tell the school, don't let them tell you that they can't do anything because of that (they use that excuse sometimes). If you tell the school that the bullying on the school bus is affecting your ability to focus and learn at school they basically have to do something about it.

Report every single motherfucker that beat me to the police, press charges. Bring forward all evidence I have. I would also consider civil action against the school, because this shit is appaling and absolutely reprehensible negligence on part of the administration.

Consider these options. IMO, top priority in your situation should be to save yourself, and your mental and physical integrity.

None of those fucking cunts is your friend. Nobody can be your friend that does not actively try to help you out of this. Treat people that way. You have value, nobody has the right to step on you that way.

Also, and this is important: Learn your local self defense laws, in case you have to defend yourself one day. Take up effective martial arts, like boxing, mma, kickboxing and muay thai, reality based stuff like Krav Maga or Combatives can be good, too. This is not to seek fights, but in case you have to make an exist, you should know how to break some eggs to make omelett.

Remember, that if you have to defend yourself, you say nothing to nobody, until you have talked to a lawyer. No matter how friendly or understanding the teachers or the cops are, no matter how much pressure they build up, until you spoke to a lawyer, you say nothing about the case or anything related to it.

e3zzf7k,t3_948m9l,"OK, a general piece of advice I give to bullying victims is to record the bullying.  In my experience, it's easier to get help when you can provide detailed and accurate information on what happened to you.  So keep a diary where you note down the details of every incident: when & where it happened, who bullied you, what they said & did, who witnessed it, etc.  Do this every day; make a habit of it.  Often the reason adults don't intervene is poor communication with the victim; a lack of understanding.",t3_948m9l

I grew up  with 'rough' boy friends, we recognized limits, didn't cause injury, in the end we talked each other up and had each others back. There is a difference between that kind of camaraderie and bullying. We just liked to wrestle like the video games. ",t3_948m9l

dz1manb,t1_dyxz1uo,"Yep. 

Most of the worst bullies in my school were ""preppies"" who were just rotten seeds destined to bear bitter fruit. Whenever they fucked up their parents would just pay to send em to a ""special doctor"" where they would act like Angels then go back to slicing ""Fag"" onto peoples' arms. ",t3_8j2r65
dyxnxet,t1_dywst8d,"Well they tend to not like them cause they say things that the school board does not like. 


""So if someone will not shut up when you told them to stop, talk to a lawyer and threaten a lawsuit against their family.

dz234zz,t1_dz1w56p,"I mean to grab their eye and remove it from their body in an act of disproportionate retribution. 

If you retaliate excessively, they will never bother you again. It's not just enough to ""Stand up to them"" - no, if you fight back, they'll come to get the last word in bringing ammunition and reinforcements. 

Schools don't like this, because the only way bullies actually stopped when you ""stood up to them"" was when you retaliated excessively. You need to put the fear of fucking god into their hearts so they become *afraid* of you. ",t3_8j2r65
dz23b5r,t1_dz234zz,Your solution would definitely work. I don't think every case of bullying requires this though. The solution needs to be tailor made depending on the type of person/people you are dealing with.,t3_8j2r65
dz2472o,t1_dz23b5r,"The sentiment isn't to literally grab someone's eye and remove it - even though it would work - usually, the solution is to just ""Retaliate excessively."" 

Because some people only speak the language of violence and pain. It isn't enough to just ""stand up to them"" - it'll make them think twice, but on the second time they think, they will instead decide to come in with a weapon or reinforcements so they can get the last word in.

c9aps2i,t1_c8tnmeb,"Before I start, I am in no way advocating bullying. 

""They know what effect they're having on the child.""
This isn't necessarily correct. Some people don't even realize they are being bullies. Some people were treated like crap when they were young from people they admire like a parent, relative, friend, whatever. They aren't trying to hurt kids. As an example they were called faggot as a passing joke and since they knew it was a joke or weren't personally harmed by it, they got used to it. They then say it to others, not as a physical attack, as just a thing people do. The were raised in such a way that they literally do not know they are hurting people. It happens. It sucks. You saying that a person dying, in any way, is okay is disgusting. A bully shouldn't necessarily be looked at as a victim, but they should get help. Some people do fit your description, and that is tragic. They should also get help. Wishing death on anyone is a horrid thing, especially when it can be helped. I know from personal experience that when a bully finds out what he has been doing without meaning it and get help, it can mean so much when he personally finds the victim and apologizes. It can even help in a way with the pain of being bullied. It doesn't erase the pain, it can just lessen it and take away a bit of fear.",t3_1a1aff
c9awtvy,t1_c9aps2i,"What I see you trying to do here is rationalize bullying behavior to a degree.  Stop it. You cannot. The reason is plain and simple. They do it because the others do it, and they want to fit in.  You want to try and make me believe, or believe yourself, that these bullies can be oblivious to the effect they're having by saying these things?   You can't possibly be serious.  They're looking right at the person they're tormenting. If they have eyes they can see the hurt looks of inner pain on their victims' faces. Yes I said victim. When you intentionally hurt someone, you're victimizing them.  You want to somehow say that just because the same thing was said to the bully, with no adverse effect, then the bully doesn't realize the effect it has. This is just hogwash. You are completely downplaying the level of intelligence these kids have. They know it's wrong. They choose to do it anyway. Therefore, they, like anyone who hurts someone knowingly, and especially for no other reason than to be entertained or accepted, deserve whatever fate befalls them.  I hold bullies in no higher regard than I would a terrorist, serial killer, or pedophile.  If a bully pushes a victim too far and gets shot by the same person they pushed to that point, I call that good karma. ",t3_1a1aff
c9b4bx0,t1_c9awtvy,"You are blind. Any behavior can be rationalized and you are a disgusting human being. I could go into detail and back up my statements with evidence, but you are a pathetic disgrace of a human being and you are in no way worth my time. ",t3_1a1aff
c9b4lcc,t1_c9b4bx0,"So, of the 2 of us, you've resorted to name calling and insulting..unsurprising behavior for a bully. That's what they do.  But you see, I have not insulted you in any way. I've merely stated my opinion, and not made it personal by calling you names.  You know what it means when you resort to the kind of petty and hurtful behavior that you have? It means you've lost the debate.  I know it. And you know it. In short, I have proven that I, the bullied, am a better person than you, the wannabe bully. I'd call it sad, but it makes me happy to point that out to you.  ",t3_1a1aff

fink9ep,t1_finiopz,"I can imagine the only factor that makes bullying less during the younger years is the facts. 

1. You're just learning how to do a thing. 
2. People don't take bullying at that age as seriously. 

Really there isn't so much of something being more or less during these years just how its handled, bullying in elementary can be seen as horseplay or kids being dumb kids and because of that it's reported or handled less.  In reality, this when bullying is at its most critical because this is where most people learn how to do it.  This is where it starts.  Just think about it when you were young, what are seen as insignificant now was a big deal as a kid, pressure to be cool like the others or to have that one toy everyone had.  It's easy to take it for granted that it's just as much of an internalized struggle for someone at any age regardless of the influences are. 

Bullying at its core is a coping mechanism, learning to be aggressive in such a way helps destress and can cause many effects on a personal level.  Look at how easy it's supported in the social element, all it takes is for a little positive reinforcement and someone can get hooked.  So this means that if the correct reinforcement is used at that key time in someone's life it can prevent the problem. 

I noticed though that bullying can then also be influenced by others, there is a lot of dehumanization in bullying and is the most common result.  So if the bully acts like this person who doesn't want to be kicked out of the social group will go along with it extending this.  

This dehumanization can also extend onto groups of people and encourage things like racism.  Even if the bully chooses not to enact like a typical bully this factor does not change.  A child who learns how to bully must keep up the habit if they are to cope and therefore will learn how to extend it onto others or get worse as time goes on to seek that hight. 

This then can extend into the adult years, I have met plenty of people who fall into this pattern in some shape or form.",t3_f7v6b1

I came up with the epiphany that of people like us can't heal from our personal issues, how can we find the time to properly connect with people? I was recently diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder (RAD)...my therapist said it makes sense for me to struggle connecting with people.

Here's to hoping you can pave your own peaceful ending after leaving college...and I hope you can learn how to deal with your family xx",t3_f7v6b1

fb8xk26,t3_ec2mf3,Lady people are assholes to be assholes plain and simple. Maybe he‚Äôs an ass to you because he got beat by a lady. I‚Äôve heard the thick skin this isn‚Äôt for you stuff my whole life. What it comes down to is people are just flat out toxic and hurtful. Some people seem to find some form of enjoyment from it. God knows why but they do. The whole thick skin thing is because people just want to be mean and be able to do it without offending because they themselves know it isn‚Äôt right. I‚Äôm almost 30 and I don‚Äôt have ‚Äúthick‚Äù skin. It‚Äôs meant to be hurtful for a reason. I wish I had a better explanation for you. I would hug you if I could.,t3_ec2mf3
fb8y2ci,t3_ec2mf3,"As my name indicates, I haven't scratched the 30 yet, but my experience on the issue is this: You can grow ""thick skin"". But it's not what you expect. At least in my experience, from what I am writing here.

I did a lot of boxing, and in sparring, you are getting hit. Hard sometimes. You can never expect such a punch to not hurt, or to not affect you. But when you accept that the punches are coming, their impact doesn't throw you off anymore (or not that much, there is always a harder punch). The pain becomes bearable. It will never be nothing, but it will be acceptable. So don't get mad for hurting, that's okay. Even hurting much, that is all okay.

Another aspect, and you already recognized this, is that people who act in such a manner, are either emotional, or in your case, abusers. People who are emotional, do not think straight, and just vent whatever. That makes their opinion worthless. They never thought about it for a second. And abusers are gonna abuse. Their opinion can be completely discarded, because they do not tell the truth about you, they lie to get to you. Everything an abuser does is a lie, including his insults, no matter how horrible they are. They are the equivalent of a rabid dog. They bite, but it's not personal, it's just how they operate. That doesn't excuse anything, and similar to a rabid dog, you avoid them or you defend yourself. But it puts their actions into context. When you recognize such a person, quit viewing them as human and never appease them, unless necessary for immediate survival. 

The third aspect that comes to mind is knowing what is true about you and knowing what you value. It's the antidote to abusive comments, even if it doesn't always work immediately. Verbal abuse works especially well when you are uncertain about your qualities, and really especially well when you have certain mental health issues (like parts of my inner voice that continue to insult me). So examine, are his claims true? Am I at fault? And do they conform to your values? 

For example, someone calls me ugly (boy that happened often): If I hear that today, I will go through: Am I ugly? Maybe. Am I at fault? Nope. Is shaming someone for his looks okay? Nah, fuck that, everyone has a right to look the way he looks! Is treating someone like this okay? Double-Fuck that!

And that's when I'd call the guy a cunt. Now, I'm not saying that this wouldn't hurt

This is the approach that came together for me over the years and it works rather well, for me. I hope you can apply some of it!",t3_ec2mf3
fbaaq0d,t3_ec2mf3,"Thing is knowing the difference between a scenario were its not worth your time vs when you aren't obligated to put up with some one else's shit.  So many times in my life people have told me to grow a thick skin, how ever something I noticed is that most of the people who told me so didn't have my best interest in mind.  

I don't know the people in your life but when a bully or jerk tells you to get a thicker skin its only for selfish reasons.  A bully once shit on me and then asked me to be the better man, in reality he was just saying that to try to force me to let him do what he wanted and its no different here.  

You are not in any way responsible for any persons behavior but your own.  So you are not obligated to change who you are.  You did nothing wrong by existing on this planet.  Your not the person who did wrong, there is nothing wrong with having emotions or being human.  Using your emotions against you is a classic shaming tactic for bullies. 

In reality there is no such thing as a ""thicker skin"".  Its just an overly simplified notion.  The thing is that if you think about it your reactions are your own, and your experiences are your own, and based on these certain things can have greater impact versus another.  

People with ""thick skins"" are just desensitized or found ways to move beyond a certain stimulus.  That's what I mean when I talk about something being worth your time.  Jut look at Reddit, if you look into my post history I have ran into plenty of ass hats, and often I have argued.  How ever that doesn't mean I couldn't move past that after the fact.   

So don't over think it, there really isn't a person who has a ""thick skin"" every one has their triggers and things they can handle.  Even you.  Just know that this dude does what he does because of his own selfishness and you are not obligated to put up with any of it.",t3_ec2mf3
fccqe1h,t3_ec2mf3,"Not everyone is fortunate enough to be sensitive. ""so sensitive"" or ""too sensitive"" just doesn't exist. A person is either sensitive or not imo.

When co-workers (male) were rude and inappropriate, I complained to the manager (male) to have him make the behaviour stop, he told me to ""grow a thicker skin"".  Absolute BS.

I think the co-workers behaved so poorly because they were allowed to do it with zero repercussions and that they really hadn't had anyone be polite, considerate and genuinely helpful at work until I got there. NO excuse though, they are still toxic people but I am no longer there to be their punching bag.

I think the manager told me to grow a thicker skin because he had no training or experience working WITH people, in HR, and really could not/would not deal with/diffuse conflict in a professional and appropriate manner. He was promoted within from a sales position and had no clue how to deal with people in general.

I always thought gently explaining how a behaviour is hurtful/inappropriate to another human being would be helpful but it only escalates the behaviour in my experience. Toxic, manipulative, cruel people are everywhere and they have perfected the game which the rest of us need to learn how to play. They don't change so our approach to the situation and our reaction to it MUST change. If we're lucky we might win the odd game but most of us would be happy just to survive the time we have to spend with these monsters.

Non-sensitive people will never understand.  But they will likely never feel the depth of feeling that you do.  Is there a way to get away from this man?  He doesn‚Äôt seem capable of empathy for you, so your options are to fight or flee.

feh6fzf,t1_fdz8a1v,"Thank you for your post. I have not read this particular book but I have read in same theme and various CBT books also.  
Unfortunately, the only way to get away from this person is to no longer play one of the only games that I enjoy regularly. I have tried others but do not enjoy them as much. Sometimes I will take a break from the game not exactly because I want to but to cleanse from the toxicity, to live life in general, and it repeats, there are a select few in this small community who are often making misogynistic remarks and virtually high-fiving each other... I could move on from the game but I feel that is a shame to be pushed out and not do what I enjoy because of few bad apples.  
I don't mind the ocassional remark that I messed up or that I am playing poorly, but what often happens is one person says something negative towards me, which is fine, but then another joins in with ""she is probably on her period again, LOL xD"" and it is so snide the way they will wait for someone else to have a problem with me and then join in, taking pot shots at me from the sideline.

f8xsfu1,t3_e2txxz,"So.. I have a question.. Your bullying that happens in college.. Is it mostly a female clique? Girls can sometimes bully differently than boys.. Its a little more insidious and mind-fucky imho.. Theres a little bit written about it; you could google ""girl bullying"" or ""female bullying"" to see some differences, and ways to deal with it might be different.

Regardless, I would recommend you see if you can find a therapist or counsellor if you have not already seen one, especially bc of the self harming and suicidal thinking.. But also because your overall self esteem seems to be struggling. Some schools have a staff student therapist that can see you for a limited time and possibly make a referral. Student insurance may also cover therapy. If you are already out of school your regular insurance might cover it too.

You may be putting yourself through some unhealthy cycles in your mental state and it might make you more vulnerable to the effects of bullying, and possibly make you a more tempting a target for some types of bullies (for example a narcissist type bully might prey on people they think they can control) but the bullying itself is not your fault. I hope you do not feel ""doomed"" to always be a target. 

I feel you can learn and help yourself to sort of be better about protecting yourself from bullies, but also from your own negative thoughts you trap yourself in. I also used to be depressed and did self harm things.. I tend to overruminate about things and people and I still kind of do, but it used to be more out of control. I think you can also find a way to a clearer headspace, especially with some guidance.

Also.. Being ""gullible"" or easy to manipulate is not necessarily a bad thing. It could mean you are trusting.  Its good if you can still have faith in people after having a rough start. 

Its bad if you can feel something is wrong but you ignore the red flags or are talked into ignoring them. But thats not gullible, its not having enough self esteem to trust your own instincts.

In either case you are probably not giving yourself enough credit. You seem kind and level headed in a way. I hope you are able to find some peace; i think you can. I wish you the best.",t3_e2txxz
f9fy6aj,t3_e2txxz,"I have a mental disability and I know how it can be hard socially because of it.  At home growing up with my schizophrenic sexist mother I was beaten a lot and treated as an embarrassment by my siblings for many years.  At school, people took advantage of my disability and bullied me.  I know what it feels like when someone does these kinds of things and then finding that others can't relate to helplessness the situation creates.  

Understand though that it's not an end-all situation no matter how entrapped you currently feel.  Right now it may be hard but understand that you have the free will and right to create your own environment.  At the moment the opportunity may be slim however if you prepare you can seize the opportunity to leave them in the dust.  

One thing to understand is that no matter what your value actually comes from you.  I know its easy to assume the opposite knowing so many people who are so willing to devalue you at a moment's notice but the reality is that they only have a barring over your value is if you let them.  No matter what happens you are still you, they can't take that away from you so beliving in your own true value as a person is a lot more important.  

No matter what happens there will be ass hats, it happens.  However these people can't destroy you, they may insult you, or even bring you onto the brink but as long as you move forward their actions lose impact.

When I tell people how bad it got by the time I left school no one tends to believe me due to how extreme it got.  One of the things I always point out as a major factor was how I was treated by the faculty and teachers.

I personally find that teachers get a by for their behavior.  When you go to work you will always find lazy, good, bad, enthusiastic co-workers.  Most places hit the entire spectrum and schools are no different.  You have lazy, good, bad, and enthusiastic teachers to.  But for some reason, if you say this usually people don't get it.  In reality, the teaching workforce needs to have the same standards in place as any other.  Instead, a lot of schools don't feel they are responsible for the learning environment they create.

This is something that needs to get out and needs to be addressed.

Thank you, OP for this submission.",t3_dyer1j
f8kqb8t,t3_dyer1j," My 1st grade teacher, she was in early 40's, usually prevented me from hanging out with my friends, made other kids bully me in school, made her 6th graders bully me, poured a bottle of water on me, ripped my notebooks, throwed my belongind into trash, etc. (yes 100 percent true) I often came from school with ripped tshirt (school uniforms are expensive), me full of mud and injured. Later, my parents reported her and she got punished and she can't be in the schools anymore. And I went to another school.
 In the 6th and 7th grade, she was born in 1973, my math teacher usually yell at me for absolutely no reason. She insulted me and my parents (yes, she said a lot of insulting words to my mom, what a fucking whore) in front of class and said ""If I were you, I would cry at the right corner"" like every week. 
Now I am in 8th grade, I am still young, but at least there aren't any bully teachers near me.

And I hope they die painfully.",t3_dyer1j

I hope you know that none of it was your fault and that there was never anything wrong with you. Know that the teacher was the one with the issue. Maybe those teachers were upset because they couldn't get laid the night before and decided to take it out on you. You just never know. :)",t3_dyer1j

I believe you because it happened to me too. This type of bullying stays with you long after school and can diminish your trust in anyone in authority. But know that it was never your fault. No one can help being disabled and any teacher who mistreats a disabled child only does so because they're lazy and don't want to put in the extra work and care! People like these teachers should not be allowed to work with children. I wish you all the success and happiness!",t3_dyer1j

f87tsn0,t1_f87qjvw,"Thank you for your positive words and its very true.  I left that school my senior year because of how bad things got and years later I went back for my diploma at a different school. Environment plays a major factor when learning and when a school allows bullying that really affects things.  The thing is that at my old school I was a D student barely passing to a B+ student at the second school.  When I went to the second school I found the old one lost my entire junior year.  So I ended up redoing a year and a half.   They also allowed me to work at my own pace with only a room attendant.  It was a very simple program we had large boxes each one with our books and homework with packets designed to replace the teachers created by the teachers.  We were allowed to work as fast or as slow as we wanted and in any order.  I did all of that work in three months.  When I was done I was really proud of myself and I realized a lot of things.  Including how much my performance was based on how I was being treated.

Later on, I came to terms with the rest.  My wife who was also bullied helped me realize that no matter how much I was blamed for my foul treatment during school it wasn't my fault.  I eventually went and majored in Psych earning my masters where I learned more.  I learned why people do it, and how it works.  I'm hoping that I can help others here as others have helped me in the past.

f08bgyc,t3_d2q6gw,"Okay i use the words articulation and indoctrination as well. You can also say things like being superficial. But what we are really trying to say here is that people will do what ever they want to another as long as they know others will go along with them. Which means the solution is have others stand up for you when a person acts out. So the bully is using the things we use to groom a society and flipping it around to enable his bad doing. And they go along with it because they want to belong to that group. Ordinarily enablers would want to belong to a healthy group and not a bully group. They also feel bullying becaus they see him do it to others all the time. Usually people don't act out because they fear embarrassment or loss of friends if they behave badly. So this is all twisted around and it is probably why you are using words like indoctrination. But that word means we are brainwashed to be like the ones around us so they don't feel ignorant. Schools parents jobs they all want you to follow in line and not ask questions. But asking questions is how ideas develope to become better. If they become better then the ones who broke it before us will feel guilty and responsible. They would have to pay something or lose something and they do not want to do that. The church and psychology therapy want you to forgive. But forgiving only enablers the wrong doer. You need to confront them. Probably the best thing to do is slowly inject people in your life and stand up to the, and if they don't get it them lol for better quality people. When we don't trust anymore it is important we go slow and find a winner. Get a base hit. Get a man on base. Our society is broken due to people not standing up and so many turning their head which allows others to get away with almost murder. It makes it now where good guys finish last. No good dead goes unpunished. No one wants to admit the elephant standing in the middle of the library floor. No one wants to admit the e order has no clothes. So what you have done here in articulating this is discover the heart behind politics. Behind every news story. Behind every good book or song. You have dabbled in the study of linguistics. You have hinted the origin of all religions. You are beginning to accurately describe the ha,n being in present day and his recent past history over many generations. It will on.u get better when there are sufficient people to constantly stand up and apply pressure when they see wrong. Take care Hope this helped.",t3_d2q6gw

If they keep putting you down and make you feel terrible about yourself then they don't deserve to be your friend. It can be nerve-wracking to tell someone you don't want to be friends anymore since it can go one way or the other, but doing it is so worth it.

Can you broaden your friendship circle? I was bullied on and off in school myself (I'm 31 now) and I coped by befriending other people who I knew were struggling with people being mean to them. There's strength in numbers and people who know what you are going through are a.great support. And you for them.

ew6c8yv,t1_ew3w7o8,"Hi and thank you for your message! It is appreciated more than you know :) Putting this kind of message in school chats is beyond necessary as this issue of Bullying is real. There are people facing this issue every day. More so then kids did in the past because of social media.  Just because the message is not melancholy does not make it less necessary to make people aware. I am not saying you said anything in regards to melancholy. I am using that as an example because a teacher in the teachers Reddit made a point to mention that. Just because the song is happy and empowering does not make it less serious. We need to empower kids to continue to be the best they can be. 

I think the issue of bullying is bigger than being pretty. I believe it starts at home with the child's siblings, parents, & nuclear family. Then the child's outside environment becomes a factor. For example, if you have a father that does not think it's cool or stupid to like science or slime and you're really good at it you will grow to be turned off by the idea of science and creating things as it was not accepted by your father. When other people play with slime and or like science you will resent them. Because your home environment did not accept it.  So you will always be bitter or jealous. Which creates other avenues for that person to bully that person. 

The song ""Smart"" is basically empowering you to be the best you that you can be. If you like slime and science. Then do it. Do what makes you happy. Because if you're happy then chances are you won't care if other kids are different from you because you're living your best life. Furthermore, your parents will learn to accept your passion because you are determined to be the best at something. 

The whole video is coming. I agree about the abusers and pedophiles. Thank you for that :)

here i go 
Half of these problems are due to capitalism. Poor parents can't do shit niether can the kids. Their stupid job dosen't give em' enough money and you see these abuse cases .You are right in a way . It is due to problems at home .But that's only true for 60% . There might be personal reasons for the bullying 
This world is money controlled. Every kid in the end realizes that they need money to get jobs etc .They resort to cheaper means so Praise Capitalism again for that .
No song is gonna fix the root of all the evil - MONEY . Parents accepting them is a problem when the kids are dependent on the parent's money .
Like i said Capitalism brought a lot of problems to this world - Education system ? That's just the tip of the iceberg",t3_cmngbx
ewelzez,t1_ewb9727,"I like deep and this kind of issue needs to be talked about. So cheers to you Sloo! Money, of course, is a reason for a lot of things but you don't have to be rich to be a good caring and supportive parent. Some parents deal with low salaries and then take out those frustrations out on substance abuse or other activities. That is their choice. Just because you have a situation that doesn't work for you does not mean your kids should suffer your wrath when you come home because of what you chose to do with your life. You had a choice. Everyone has a choice. They are free to make their own choices. You don't have to stay in a job that treats you like garbage. It's your choice to stay there. You can always find a better job. You can always go back to school or even start a business etc. Most people are just comfortable in a situation and don't want to put in the effort to look. While some people are just scared to take a chance and then they live their life with the should ah could ah mentality.  

Furthermore, blaming other people, or money, or outside factors is just making an excuse for your own actions. People need to take responsibility for their own actions. Instead of passing the baton on everything else. 

Secondly, let's say you are creative. You have 2 choices in my opinion. You either A. Find a job that you can best utilize your talent and become the best you can be. Or B. You create a career you create a job for yourself and become an entrepreneur to sell your service or product. Then you work like hell to make it work because you are doing what you love. I teach my kids. Do what you love and the money will come. It's that simple. 

Finally, The time is now for young people and adults alike to take responsibility for their actions instead of dreaming of another life or wanting to be someone else. Be the best you! That is the whole meaning behind the song ""SMART!"" Just like it says in the song. If you are raised with self-esteem and pushed to follow your dreams, you are never going to give up no matter how hard it seems at school/life/work, etc. And that my friend is what makes you ""SMART""

eq3jb9c,t3_bx41sh,"Hello (and prepare for a rambling answer). Thank you for posting. You never have to apologize for what you're feeling. I have severe depression, and there are some people in my life--people who are generally sympathetic to me--who just don't ""get it"" and who want to tell my why I shouldn't be depressed. Some people contain things within them that are poison even if to outer appearances things are perfect.

Further, a lot of people who are bullied are the nonconformists and the outsiders and the ones who are different. The bullies will often intentionally make you feel bad or guilty for not being like everyone else, or even if they don't intend this, it's the effect. They will guilt trip you for things that you cannot control, whether bad or good. The common denominator is that one way or another, they want you to feel bad, or at least don't care whether you feel bad or not.

In my case I got it not just from school bullies but from my mother--I feel inadequate, I feel like I don't have a right even to exist, and at the same time ""friends"" tell me I have no right to feel this way because I have food, money, job etc.

Guess what: they don't get to vote on how I should feel, and I don't have to explain myself to them. (I keep telling myself this, but i need lots of external validation, unfortunately. Nevertheless, objectively it's the truth.)

Nice neighbors, good friends, woods, bike at age 11, T.V. in my room, etc.. and I realized that I hated those kids from that shit school, but I would routinely go hang out with them to get treated like trash, belittled, told I was ""horrible or I sucked"" etc.. since they convinced me that it was 'unfair' for me to have those things, since I was a minority and evil, and to appease them, I accepted it.. it fucked me up for years.

I have heard a lot of different things. and because of my timid nature I never really talk about myself, some didn't even know I had suicide attempts or suffered from depression.

the thing is that it is impossible to know what someone has gone through if you haven't listened to their story, actually listened and understood not just heard. they probably don't realise the toll your history took on you. most people with a past like them (and people with a past like you) tend to try to be compassionate and understanding because they know just how easy it can be to fall deep in life.

you might have never gone hungry and had both parents but I bet they don't know the full extend of the devastation that can come from negative body views or BPD; or the self hate caused by anxiety. The mind is unimaginably complex and ""pain"" isn't just easily compared by looking at how bad it looks on the surface.

anyones problems matter. doesn't matter if it's a strained connection between brothers or severe depression from watching your parents die. it's not some competition to find out who has the most right to complain. it's a call for the compassion of other humans, a need to have someone help you in bad times.

Thank you for sharing this. People should see it so they know how awful others can be for no damn reason. It makes me want to go out today and notice those around me and look for opportunities to give a kind word to another. I mean, the people who tear people down never fail to look for the chance to do so... those of us who aren't down with hurting people need to look for as many opportunities to build people up as we can find, to help offset the damage the others do. 

I'll start with you. It's hard to share stories like this because they hurt us and we naturally try to protect ourselves by trying not to think about it, burying it down, suppressing the pain. Doing what you did instead, and sharing what happened? That's brave- and smart, too! I was bullied when I was in grade school through middle school and I'm 40. It took me years of self-destructive behaviors and choices before I finally decided to figure out wtf I was so hurt and angry about, and there was a part of me that never grieved the attacks of my peers against me during my adolescence. I hope you continue to be brave so you don't have to lose any of your adulthood to such.

None of  this is about you, remember that. (It took years of therapy for me to realise this after being told the contrary by adults at the time.) It's all down to them. Bullies don't need a reason to be who they are - they are damaged, malfunctioning people who deserve to be shut in a lunatic asylum till the end of their days. Steer clear of this retarded piece of trash if you can, but it of course would be more fun to clap them right back where it hurts e.g 'Who are you talking to - the only piece of s\*\*t here is you. You even talk it,' 'You're so skinny looks like even your brain starved to death etc.' Or just treat this person like he/she's dead - ignore them, don't listen to anything they say, walk right through them and watch them go absolutely mental at not getting the reaction they want.",t3_bme7bt

Sometime in middle school, I got better at fighting back, and there were fewer black eyes in the photos.  Still some, but they were fewer in number.  I was in hundreds of fights, just in elementary school.  Once a friend counted 10 kids beating on me at the same time.  They didn't intervene, because -- well, I don't blame them for not intervening, they only would have been beaten down, too.

I'm not a pretty man.  The few women I've dated -- I always found them lovely, but attraction is subjective, at least to a degree -- almost uniformly stated that I was not their standard for attractiveness, or not the usual level of attractiveness for them, but my character or personality made up for it.

Then the army happened, and shit hit the fan.  I came to in a hospital in Germany after having my face rebuilt, and I was even less pretty than I was before.  Now my face is all kinds of asymmetrical, and since symmetry plays a large role in attraction, my lack of it, coupled with the scars on my face and my head, tends to mean I am completely alone.  I have a few people I occasionally hang out with, but I'm not pretty, young children tend to look at me with fear in their eyes, and there's just a general sadness and loneliness in me now.

I‚Äôm a teacher, So many I can help a little; 
If you don‚Äôt think you could speak directly to a teacher to try to get some help, do you think you can write a letter? 
You can write something like 

Mr/Ms._________
I am having some issues with _____, ____ and, _____ they are spreading a rumor about me that makes me feel unsafe. I was told to go to a teacher but I am anxious about talking face to face. 

You can go up to the teacher and say ‚Äúthis note is private, can you open it during lunch time?‚Äù Then hand them the letter 


I know you have anxiety about talking with a teacher or adult, but, unfortunately this note will notify them but it will not explain more/defend your side of the story. You will have to talk to somebody eventually. If you hand a note to the teacher explaining that you‚Äôre feeling unsafe and you‚Äôre anxious about talking about why...then they will know to be more gentle with you and help the experience seem less scary. 

If you still don‚Äôt want to talk to a teacher, if you have a safe environment at home you might get a parent to talk to the teachers for you. 

MOST teachers are not bad and aren‚Äôt there to get you in trouble and make you feel bad for your feelings, there has to be atleast one adult in school or in your life that will help you through this and make you feel more safe. No child deserves to go to school and feel unsafe. 

Stay strong and take a deep breath, being scared about talking to teachers is a normal thing since they are the authority (person in charge). But we‚Äôre human like you and chances are they have been through something similar to you. 

Your physical differences do not make you a freak, I‚Äôm so sorry that you were made to feel this way. As long as you love yourself nobody can take that away from you. I am sure that you are an intelligent , bright, and awesome person. 


Remember, like all things in life‚Äî this will past... and if you can make it through the night, there‚Äôs a brighter day.

Stay strong and feel better.

It really does not help that for the past 4 years, I've gone to high school with most of the truly bad ones. This was after the years I suffered from them beforehand. I see them in the hallway today or they say something and honestly, it's really upsetting. I've blocked out so much of that time and sometimes I'll get a flashback after an interaction with them. It hurts.

People need to mind their own business. Only real friends understand that this still bothers me today and they don't even know the majority of it and don't ask. They may not have understood at first but no one can and they do now and they haven't ever said ""get over it"".

e5fxzaa,t3_9d2yl2,"Man, I feel your pain... Literally, I read this post and it brought me screaming back to middle and high school.  I was short and hit puberty late, and as a result was bullied incessantly.  This long period culminated in being splashed with acid in high school, which thankfully healed mostly.  So I know the horrible toll, mentally and physically, that bullying can take. 

I agree with the prior poster's sentiment, but acting crazy or school shooter-y is not the answer. You may not be bullied, but you may get shunned and isolated and buy in to the new persons.  As U2 sings in ""Peace on Earth"" :

They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you

My advice, for what it is, is to find friends with similar interests. Concentrate on school.  Try not to show fear, and don't live in it.  Tell your folks.... Don't withdraw. Alot of times, the bullies are taking out other problems on you, whether envy or a poor home life. If it comes to it, fight once if you have to.  Even if you take a beating you'll generally gain respect and they'll move on. Don't show them it bothers you.

If it becomes unbearable, report them. There are stricter rules now.  Look into a private school. Just don't endure in silence.  Play the long game... If you do, you'll generally have the last laugh.

And I agree. Work out. Learn martial arts or something. But keep busy and don't Billy yourself. What they say doesn't reflect on you. 

Good luck and all the best. ",t3_9d2yl2
e5g4zoa,t3_9d2yl2,"Looking younger is not inherently bad, look at the adults around you, many try to look younger. But I know that at your age it is a big deal. If it is only one kid and he only did it once, try to avoid him, maybe he will forget. If more kids start to pick on you, then seek help from the adults.

If you think there is something wrong with your development, you should ask to visit a doctor.

Now some tips to ""becoming an adult"":

The main reason most kids don't hit puberty is because they don't do any sports. Doing sports triggers the production of testosterone. If that is your case, I would suggest start swimming 3 times a week. Swimming is ideal, because it is an intensive and exhausting sport, plus you can progress at your own pace since it is not a team sport. I wouldn't recommend a team sport because you would be in a disadvantage to your peers who already have hit puberty.

Other things you might do, is to avoid sweets and candy, sugar increases insulin level, which in turn reduce your testosterone levels.

Did you do sports with intensity, to the point of being exhausted or did you just participate in ""sports"" but never really did much nor got tired from playing?

I would give swimming a shot, it is a very complete activity and you won't be competing against somebody.

Quitting sweets might help you tilt the scale and it can't harm you.   Your brother is already going through puberty, he doesn't need to do things to trigger it.

In 4th/5th grade there was a girl that choked me on multiple occassions and stabbed me in the knee with a sharpened pencil. I still have the mark nearly twenty years later. I don't remember complaining about any of this to my parents, but they were having marriage issues and I didn't want to make things worse. These were physically annoying, but looking back I preferred these instances to what came in middle school and high school.
I had hoped to escape the awkward weirdo phase elementary school had put me through. I was sure things would be better since I now had contacts instead of thick nerd glasses. Ahh, naive me. Those hopes were thoroughly destroyed but a c@nt named Allison who made it her mission to tear me down on a daily basis for four years. She turned my few elementary school friends against me in a matter of days, telling them all I was a lesbian and a perv. Those are social circle death sentences if you go to a conservative Catholic school. I don't know if anyone actually believed her, but they always acted like they did. People avoided sitting next to me on the bus or in our lunch room. They would giggle along with Allison when she was talking about me. I came to hate school and everyone in it. I was alone, abandoned, and often came home in tears. I became very depressed and bordered on suicidal. I had some painful medical issues for two of those years. This caused me to limp and Allison used to walk behind me and imitate as others laughed. Turns out i had a tumor in that leg that required multiple surgeries. When i came back on crutches , she would slam doors shut. Allison might have done this until the day we graduated if I hadn't snapped and grown a backbone. I saw her passing  note one day that had another 'x is a pervy lesbo' on it and grabbed her by the strap of her backpack before tossing her against a locker. She ran off screaming and everyone just stared. No one ever called me a freak or lesbo ever again. Allison herself dropped to the bottom of the social totem pole. Turns out teens are quick to turn on each other at the slightest provocation.
Its strange, I've long forgiven my elementary school bullies, but Allison is different. I hated her for years. Not the typical teen angst hate, but a dark hatred where I wished all manner of vicious ill on her. Its tapered off over the years, but i still hold a certain contempt towards her and people like her. Allison, if you are somehow still out there, I don't want you to die, but I hope you never have complete peace in your life. My revenge is living well with my wonderful man and adorable dog. You have to live the best life you can. Theres a good chance your bully ended up like mine, alone and working a sad dead end job. Karma comes for us all in the end. When we mistreat others, something rotten grows inside and others can sense it. It makes them feel repelled. Thats how i move on. ",t3_9433zg
e3l504h,t3_9433zg,"I‚Äôm sorry all this happened to you. Most importantly, you have to put some distance between you and them. Social media only reinforces bonds that you don‚Äôt need. Remove them from your life. 

Get some counseling. Even just talk therapy, get it out of your mind and into the air. It sounds awful and weird, but it helps. 

I‚Äôm almost 45 and I‚Äôm still having trouble dealing with what happened. I don‚Äôt go to reunions. I moved to a different county for 15 years. I don‚Äôt have kids, so I don‚Äôt run the risk of seeing them at a PTA meeting. 

I actually saw one abuser on a realtor sign the other day. I didn‚Äôt know it was him, only the name identified him and thought ‚Äúwhoa ‚Äòjock boy‚Äô got fat and aged  terribly‚Äù. So life took revenge for me. 
 
",t3_9433zg
e3jbut9,t3_9433zg,"> How do I stop doing this? How do I let go of the hatred and negative feelings that arise every time I think about it?

That is tough, time and persistence. Find distractions when you are thinking about doing that, over time you will probably think less and less of it. Surround yourself with good friends that you can talk to about this, talk to someone, some times just talking about it can help get over those feelings. 

When you are feeling strongly about these memories, think about the good things about yourself, write them down, take time to talk yourself up, focus on these things. Even though you encountered some assholes in life, that doesn't mean you what they said is true, they just said what they though would get under your skin. ",t3_9433zg

Thank you for saying that! Bullies actually don't stop bullying after school. It is a truth that needs to be heard. People will sometimes say that they grow up and have no need to do that anymore, but I've realized they do! 
I like your point of view on this! Their opinions really shouldn't matter at all! Though I'm still kind of stuck on the caring about what other people think of me. The good thing is that I have a counseling appointment coming up, so that should help. ",t3_9433zg

I on the other hand, became homeschooled after an accident that nearly killed me. It was in the same year she bullied me and after the accident she still had the audacity to come up to me and make fun of me with her friends. I just wish I would have stuck up for myself at that time. It would have saved me so much time wasted on anger! My bully graduated as thespian of the year. Not only that, but I had accidently told her my plans of going to a highschool in woodland park and she immediately moved there! It really sucked, but I was in online anyway so i never saw her. ",t3_9433zg

I guess the real greatest moment will be when I can rid them from my head and stop letting their past actions control my life. I do have a counseling appointment scheduled on the 14th and I will talk about this.

My grandfather lost his son at 10, he was emotionally crippled for the next 60 years of his miserable life. Everyone had to take care of him. He was never a ‚Äúgrand parent‚Äù to me and I shed not one single tear for him when he died. He made the decision to ignore his other children, including my father, his siblings and his wife who had to become surrogate father and primary caregiver. to 4 in the 60‚Äôs!

Unfortunately, you‚Äôll find bullies wherever you go. They‚Äôre everywhere. Even those who suffered bullying sometimes are prone to bullying others themselves.

One example: there was a Reddit user who posted how she was called ‚Äúugly‚Äù all throughout her childhood and adolescent years, and how she has self image/esteem issues now because of it. I read her words with sympathy until she ended her post with, ‚ÄúMaybe if I grew up in the US, I would‚Äôve been accepted because they‚Äôre all fat and don‚Äôt know how to dress properly.‚Äù That may not be exactly verbatim, but that‚Äôs essential what she said.

So, here was a young woman who was victimized by verbal abuse/bullying, yet had no problem verbally abusing/bullying others.

Needless to say, I pointed out the hypocrisy.

Maybe that‚Äôs just how some victims of bullying cope?

Is there anyone from that group you‚Äôve gotten comfortable conversing with? If so, I strongly recommend you focus on them, and forget the jerks. Really. They‚Äôre not worth your time, so don‚Äôt waste precious brain power dwelling on them, or their words.

Keeping extremely clean  by showering twice a day (I know) & re-applying rx deodorant/antiperspirant after each shower,  drinking loads of water,  and throwing out any old  stained/contaminated t-shirts and clothes helped a ton also, because they hold the smell/bacteria in the fibers and  constantly re-infect you, even when they just came from the wash. Just buy a couple packs of cheap  cotton tees & change them religiously.  Don't think you can just buy the otc  ""clinical  strength"" stuff, it will not work. It has to be from your doctor.  Just speak up & ask next time you're in.  Good luck!!",t3_fzpe3v

The dermatologist told me about this deodorant called ‚Äòlume‚Äô that can help odor causing bacteria, sweating, etc. But I told her I tried and it didn‚Äôt work, then I recently I went to do some more research on that deodorant, I came across a prepping ur clothes video on YouTube for ‚Äòlume‚Äô. They were saying that I have to prep my clothes before putting them in the washer with a spray by the brand ‚Äúnature‚Äôs miracle‚Äô. I looked it up it said it‚Äôs used for pets/odors, I was kinda confused. But says it‚Äôs safe to use on clothes, and that it can work better with the persil detergent. So I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll give that another go with that deodorant, I hope it can solve this issue.

I‚Äôm familiar with Hibiclens from a clinical antiseptic testing standpoint. It is good at removing bacteria, but also depend on the contact time for the best results. Perhaps try sudsing up and letting it sit for at least 3 minutes if you still have any? I figure it might be hard to find during this whole COVID-19 thing. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd use during our decontamination protocol for atleast hands. We used a different type of antiseptic on the body, but it‚Äôs just a different formulation of the active ingredient, and it‚Äôs more for surgical site preparations. 

And don‚Äôt worry about your mom. My mom is also the same way.  Sometimes you just need to make an appointment and not say anything to them. I share everything with my mom, but when I found out medical issues I did not want to share with her, I had to keep it quiet and go myself.  I would try going again to see if they can run tests.

You seem to know a lot about these things, how are you not a doctor? Lol. Also, my brother and I are on her health insurance. 
And I remember when I went to the dermatologist, I took a test for my thyroids because I thought this issue was an overactive thyroid or something. A few months later I got the results and it came back negative, I was quite confused. And she was telling me before that I could try the advice she gave me, and if none of that works
I should come back and see what she can prescribe for the sweating and odor. But I never went back because of my parents, again my parents keep trying to get in the way. They‚Äôre always saying things like it‚Äôs all in my head and I shouldn‚Äôt worry about this. Like how about I comeback from the gym all sweaty and smelly, is it still in my head?

fo1398i,t1_fnyo5la,"The body one we used was called chlora prep,  but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, since it‚Äôs more of a rub, and not a soap. It‚Äôs the same chemical, just slightly different, and has alcohol to dry. It‚Äôs a surgical prep, so it also has a stain inside.  I also think it‚Äôs pretty pricy for small amounts, so it‚Äôs probably best to stick to hibiclens. 

Lol. I wanted to be a doctor and tried, but didn‚Äôt have the best grades. I ended up liking lab work anyways. I‚Äôm also just really fascinated by bacteria and viruses.

fjk2w46,t3_fds981,"This one hits home for me as well.

My daughter (now 13) is on the spectrum and when she was in kindergarten in a ""prestigious"" Manhattan private school, I used to make it a point of going to pick her up every single day. I would get there very early, usually when the kids were still fussing around the playground area.

This one particular November day after most all the other kids were back inside getting ready to leave the school my daughter and ""her friends"" (my daughter had told me numerous times they were her friends) were playing near a plant potter, essentially a decorative cement bowl, which was filled with dirty water (growing season was over and it rained few nights before).

I was about 20 ft away when I saw my daughter ad picked up a stick and looked like she was stirring the water. She pulled out the stick and I saw there was black gunk on the end of it. The other girls, noticing that I was right there, were whispering something to my daughter, and saying ""go ahead!! Do it!!"" at which point I got what was happening and went over to them and coaxed my daughter away from the stick and bowl. The ""friends"" scattered, giggling, ""she was gonna DO it!""

I brought it up to her teacher and the headmaster. Same as you. Same responses. No action taken, or even implied. I was even told to calm down, because ""in the end, nothing happened, right?""",t3_fds981

fnptbm6,t3_fds981,"Idk how helpful this is but I distinctly remember as a kid watching a documentary called ""Growing Up Phillip"" or something like that. It was about a special needs child and in the movie Phillip takes food off of another kids plate. From that point I remember having some form of fear of special needs people that I had honestly until my early 20s. There was also a child in my school who had an aide who everyone knew and seemingly tried to stay away from. I remember him taking a football of mine and walking to the woods and throwing it where i couldnt find it. I remember just being nervous around special needs people because the behavior felt erratic and it made me uncomfortable not knowing what to expect or not being able to communicate with them. 

None of that justifys bullying by any means but I feel that fear can lead to this feeling of wanting to be stronger than the fear (""How can I be afraid of this kid, look at him. Im better than him"") Normalization I feel his helpful to make kids not be fearful of what they dont understand.

A turning point for me was a disabled adult at a wrestling show. I would watch him come in and welcome everyone he walked by. He would cheer the good guys and check on the bad guys if he thought they were really hurt. He was just so pure. I noticed he would always be at the mall waving and speaking to people. Someone made a shitty comment to him so i walked over and talked to him. He said ""Its okay. I love me thats all that matters."". He considered everyone his family. Hes a guy I would keep an eye on in the mall after we would chit chat just to make sure he was safe and no one was picking on him. I had never felt so protective over someone in my life. His unconditional love and care really opened my eyes. I havent seen him in about a year or more now but writing all this really made me think about him and want to check on him.",t3_fds981

Yes, it's tougher to be non-straigth and dating people with baggage. One of them is not a choice, but they still have to tell you what's coming, and what is easy and what is tough on your life.

They probably think they can still change who you like. But it's all about the person you are with. If you tell them you want to date married women because you do then that's just a dumb thing to say, so until they hear ""i am dating (person's name and situation here) because that's who I want to be with"" then I don't know how you expect them to stop trying to ""change"" you, it seem like you just want to fight as well, or at least be a victim, because even though I have no experience in this area, I can 100% guarantee when you are sure of what you want, and the person you want to be with, and they clearly see it, then they will reach their real stance, but not before, not when it's just hearsay and wishful thinking, thats just human behavior, we don't believe it until it smacks us in the face. Parents wont believe what their children are until it's presented to them like a 100 foot wave smashing them.

fimroxa,t3_f8n3vm,"Classic bully phrase.  I start with the I shouldn't have to do anything because you should know better.  I tend to talk down to bullies so I open with this one to establish that they are in the wrong.  Then when they start making threats I continue.  If they go with ""I'm going to kick your ass!"" or something threatening violence I say, ""Okay, you do it, right here, right now, I won't fight back, I""ll let you but to warn you I'll be laughing at your dumb ass from the ambulance as you get hauled away by the cops.  I earn a week off while you earn forced early retirement."" 

I found that bullies who act like this want a reaction, usually a specific reaction.  They don't care about rules or any standard, I doubt this guy cares as much about his job as much as you do.  I also noticed that as long as they feel they are getting something out of it, even if they get into trouble then it's worth it.  So fighting back when he eggs you on could be giving him what he wants.  (Note I mean physically fighting.)  So finding a way to get them to understand that they just aren't going to get what they want really helps.  

So by putting on the spot where they have nothing to gain does help some.  I have actually used lines like above and similar in the past and found they work fairly well, simply because it's just not giving out what the bully wants.  Of course, there will always be exceptions and I don't know your bully that well.  However understand that much of the time words are words and that most of what a bully says is just as hallow, but they don't care about being honest while you are.

If you have no support system then stay persistent and continue performing your duties. When disrespected, you will need to find a strategy to deal with every micro aggression in a smart way. 

From your descriptions, the ""adults"" you are describing seem to have not matured completely. You don't want to be like them, you don't wish to be in their place; you become something different and better. Know their weaknesses. Literally. This is very important. Every little act they do, no matter how small, you will not forget it no matter what. Write their petty acts on an online notepad because the human mind makes you forget these small yet painful stuff. 

Know that this isn't your fault. But seriously. Find their weaknesses. And every disrespectful thing they do put a mental strategy into how to get back at them. Don't be passive. Acting like everything is okay is NOT OKAY when things are actually bad. You need to find that perfect balance on when to show your dissatisfaction and when you don't react. Some situations it's okay to ignore and not to react. However, other situations you have to strike back in a smart way. It's different for every bully. They are all unique. Just know that no one is solely prey or soley predator. A prey could become a predator and go into the offensive, and a predator could become a prey in some situations because they are not gods incapable of being hurt. 

You are capable of hurting people. Of course hurting *people who deserve it.* Don't let your claws get rusty, you need to use them from time to time to preserve them. Be smart and observe your office politics. Really understand the reasons why they are doing what they do.",t3_evvqmc

ffa3obs,t3_es600y,"K you always have to gauge your situation. So the strategies I suggest may not work all of the time, because nothing does.

First of all if you're able to ignore them and carry on that's best. That isn't always doable and sometimes when you ignore a problem like that it grows.

Let me help you with the age thing, it doesn't matter. If you're 15 and a 5 yrs old is trying bully you, you will not care. If you see them as peers, you're on equal ground. Age is not relevant.

The best way to scatter the roaches is to shine a light on them. I often found if I could draw attention go what was going on, without ratting anyone out, was the most effective.

Sometimes you have to make a scene, which can be as simple as a well timed loud comment that makes people stop and look. One time a kid said something about me to another classmate, in a loud clear voice I told him to shut it. I'm the underdog, no one cares if they hurt my feelings. In fact that was the point. Suddenly there's a teacher wanting to know what's going on.

I didn't rat, I just told the other kid to repeat himself. Which he really did not want to do.

Another time to kids sitting behind me were saying things to make my girlfriend cry. In a loud clear voice I made a comment about their sex life, and called them by name. Now again suddenly all eyes were on us. They did not want this, they wanted to sit in the back and quietly embarrass us. We were already embarrassed, so I thought we should share.

The point is when you find a way to draw attention onto poor actions, suddenly no one wants to be involved anymore.

Hope this helps.",t3_es600y

I just get these bouts where it feels like no one likes me (even though I have no reason to think that), and niceness from everyone starts looking suspicious., or like.. Forced or artificial?

I used to feel like that in hs, even though, as I said I don't think I was bullied.. it was just sort of my default for some reason. 

At some point I decided ""well I don't have any real evidence that they don't like me, so I know I must be making a lot of assumptions about people's intentions."" Then I thought ""if I assume by default people don't like me, it probably affects how I act around them, making me maybe unlikable.""

Then I decided because of a lack of evidence proving otherwise, I would assume everyone did like me and wanted to be friends. I consciously made an effort to ""believe"" this even if I didn't really believe it. And I think it worked, like people seemed friendlier to me and more responsive, even though I knew I was kind of forcing myself to believe this new narrative.  But I couldn't keep it up, so I didn't remain soo cheerful. But by then, the damage was done and I made friends on accident.

They were and still are good people, but then I realized I wasn't really ""like them."" So now were just friends/acquaintences. But thats ok.

So now, I kind of pick up on this vibe that *could* be interpreted like people maybe don't like me, or are being disingenuous.. But then I read it more like a hesitancy or uncomfortableness, and I don't know why, but thats ok. If I want to get to know the person better, I might try to find out whats up, if I'm reading something into them that isnt there. But most times I realize I don't really care either way.

 I mean right now it sounds like youre the one more in control of the situation, just because hes scared.

But since it is on your mind it tells me two good things: 1. you're a decent human being and 2. You have it in you to make things good between the two of you again. 

I mean you were friends before right? You both made mistakes. You guys can salvage this, if you both want to. If it doesn't work out, well, you tried. The attempt counts as maturity though.  Maybe consult a school counsellor on best way to approach it.

f843htk,t3_dyw1yx,"You can forgive anyone.  Forgiveness isn't about reconciling, it's about letting go of your own emotional response to the person.  You don't have to absolve them of their blame, or believe what they did was right.  Most middle school bullies grow into the realization that they were assholes.  They'll probably never seek out their victim(s) and apologize, but more often than not they feel some guilt for their actions.  Anyway, forgiveness means different things to different people, it's a range from the Christian trying to love them, to the more stoic learning to be indifferent towards their past actions.  I don't think it really matters even if you make a decision to ""forgive"" them, just deciding not to waste any more time or energy negatively affecting your life thinking about them can be good enough.",t3_dyw1yx

fduqxub,t3_dyw1yx,"It took me a couple of years, but at some point I realized that the guy who bullied me was just scared himself.  
Shortly before I left school we were forced to sit next to each other. And that guy, whom i hated because he bullied me all my school life, and I started to talk about math. And I ended up explaining him math.  


Afterwards I was very angry with myself: why would I help that person? Why would I even bother.

Quite some time, even years later, I understood that he was scared to fail, and he was jealous of me, as school was always easy for me.

Only then I was able to forgive him. It made click and I saw things from his perspective.

That does not mean I am not effected; I still am. But I am working on accepting my past and not be angry with myself all the time.  
Its a very long process. I think i am getting closer. Talking about it helps. I dont think about the things that happen all the time, but I have developed a very negative thinking stream. And I blame other people when things go wrong, as i feel like a victim. That does not effect that guy, just me and my current life, relationship with people around me at work etc. So I hope to be able to let go of that baggage and become the person I really am, not staying the one that hates herself.

Thats how I am trying to cope :)",t3_dyw1yx
f850yc5,t3_dyw1yx,"This is a tough one for me...

I was severely bullied in middle school 30+ years ago. I have a lot of unresolved anger and hate issues because of it.

I have developed PTSD type symptoms in the past recent years and I have made attempts to contact my childhood tormentors to confront them regarding the bullying and the long term effects it has on me.

Two of my biggest bullies I‚Äôve tried to make contact with won‚Äôt even respond or even acknowledge me. One of them went as far as to block me on Facebook after I posted a rant on one of his public posts regarding the physical assaults he made on me in the boy‚Äôs locker room. I tried to have a conversation in private with him on Messenger initially, but he wouldn‚Äôt respond.

The other is a local 3rd grade teacher. I‚Äôve sent him 10+ emails. He has never once responded.

I had a meltdown a little over a month ago, and I imploded on Facebook. I was somehow able to tag a girl who embarrassed me in front of everyone on the bus ride home. She‚Äôs not even one of my friends, so I don‚Äôt know how I was able to tag her, but she responded right away and apologized. I was spiteful at first and told her that her apology would‚Äôve meant something if I didn‚Äôt have to solicit it three decades later. She agreed.

I messaged her in private afterwards and told her how she made me feel at the time and how it still makes me feel. I told her what I was going through at home while all the bullying was going on. She apologized several times and told me that she became a Christian since that time and has apologized to many people for things she‚Äôs done in the past.

I gave her credit for replying. That was more than the others have done. She took that as me accepting her apology. It‚Äôs odd, but I‚Äôm not seeking apologies. I want those people to simply admit that they did indeed bully me. I just need the acknowledgment.

I was very drunk and depressed that night, so I deleted all the rants on my wall, including the one with the apology. I feel like I don‚Äôt have to dwell on her anymore. 

Yes, I believe it‚Äôs possible to forgive your childhood bullies without any of them trying to make amends, but you‚Äôd have to be a very strong person to do that. 

I am weak, sadly.

Best regards to you and I hope you are able to forgive.

Don't be afraid to speak up. Similar thing happened, vice principal threatened to kick me out and as soon as she fired off her first threat I shouted: ""IM SORRY IM WEIRD!!!"" Her door was wide open, everyone could hear me. She then gave me a piece of candy and said: ""take this and get out."" 

Later on she tried again to kick me out (even thought she said: ""I don't know why I'm kicking you out that's why I brought you here to ask you."") And my parents helped me out, got pissed at her, and I was able to transfer. 

This was in a Technical College. A lot of times, people won't give you a even a second to report bullying. Welp, I have autism and my parents paid a lot of money and I refuse to be kicked out for no reason besides reporting bullying.",t3_dqcnxc
f4vueiy,t3_djvgvh,"This is what I hate about schools, especially with the American school system, teachers and other adults don't take action against children who bully others. There was one case of a high schooler who committed suicide because his manager at his job also bullied him. No one reported the numerous incidents between the manager and the boy and after the boy's suicide, the manager was charged for involuntary manslaughter, but then it got dropped. 

In my case, when I was in middle school and high school, all the adults I spoke to said they can only have a talk with the bullies. So it was a slap on the wrist and the torment got worse. 

I think the reason teachers can't take action against bullying is because they are not trained to handle situations such as that or they were told by the school system that it's ""kids being kids"". This really needs to change! The age of children committing suicide due to bullying is getting younger, the youngest I heard was a child of around ten years of age. When a child commits suicide due to bullying, the bullies are usually not held accountable, but they should be! The parents of bullies should also be held accountable and pay restitution for the parents who lost their child.",t3_djvgvh
fdzkh9j,t3_djvgvh,"It‚Äôs because bullies have rights too.  The right to due process, the right to face their accuser, etc.  The charismatic bullies just lie and say that the victim is targeting them.

The teachers know what‚Äôs what but we can‚Äôt do jack about it.  Unless we can personally eyewitness an incident, it‚Äôs one kid‚Äôs word against another‚Äôs.

If it continues, or even regardless, report it to your boss or supervisor along with your record of trying to make them stop. 

At te same time i would look up if there are laws in your state relating to workplace bullying or hostile work environments (may not apply if you aren't a protected class but may be worth just checking).

Keep one eye out for a different place that can treat you better or pay you more. Always. Know your options so you don't feel trapped, even if you never use them.",t3_dik82o

I've complained many times about her but nothing ever gets done. They just expect me to suck it up and honestly, I do suck it up, but it doesnt mean she doesnt bother me.

I admire you for riding it out. Sometimes there's nothing we can do when we're faced with these maniacs. Stay in touch with people who matter to you, it really helps not to socially withdraw when you're dealing with a lot of stress in your life. Are you doing any counselling with anybody or therapy as well? It's okay to ask for help from them if you're stressed out. You probably are aware of that but I just needed to add that anyway just in case.
I also wanted to add to please do not for a second blame yourself. This stuff can happen to anyone.

My name is Scott and I am in North Carolina. One of your students recently reached out on reddit.com about being bullied in the r/bullying forum or sub reddit. This person stated that all the other students in their class wanted him/her to kill themselves. Also the original poster stated they were constantly being jumped and beat up and left bleeding. The original poster has apparently reached out for help, but no one is doing anything about it at the school nor the police. I just wanted to let you know that I will not tolerate the actions from your school. Something needs to be done asap. If not, I will go to the media about this or I will talk to the principle and get to the bottom of this one way or another.. I'm sure yall have a lot on your plate to deal with, but no student should have to go through bullying to any degree, and in this case this is an extreme case of bullying. Please email me back and let me know what yall decide to do about the situation. If there is any way possible for me to talk to the principle directly, or have yall forward this email to the principle that would be greatly appreciated. The original poster and I are direct messaging each other and I will inform them to go speak with Mrs. H Collins to further escalate the problem.

They're just words. They can't do anything that will actually affect your studies. You can get better results and a proper job and they will eat their own words. Big Mama gets a job , other motherfuckers don't . 

What the fuck do you think they can do ? They probably can't even study (most of em ) the lessons properly. You're in collage .Fuck them . You'll be successful in life and they won't .  In the end Only a job or Money matters. 

If you ever realize that in the capitalist world , Only money will give you support. SO those faggots who keep making fun of you will die with their families or get kicked out and suicide. fucking pussies will burn in hell. 

This is gonna get a bit dark here .When you see them or any former bullies in a shitty position , you fuck up their lives make fun of them, Let them know that in the end you won ( Kinda like how Kira won in Death Note ). Make fun of their parents and their shitty lives if you want. This is the method i use.

I've always been quite skinny and before I got lens implants, as a child I wore glasses and those thick 'coke bottle' glasses at that.  At the time i thought it was because of my glasses that i was bullied, but it was only as i got older that i realised that probably wasn't the main reason.  The reason was that because I was self conscious about my glasses, I carried myself in such a way that I sort of made myself a target.  It was only as I got older and started to accept the way I looked that began to carry myself in a more proud way, walking with my head held up.  I know it's easier said than done but you just need to have a bit more belief in yourself, hold your head up, and walk with more confidence.  If people see you going about hunched up, head done, looking at the floor instead of not drawing any attention to yourself like you are hoping/trying to do.  You are actually drawing more attention to yourself and certain types of people might see you as a target.  But if you walk with your head up, confident you'll probably not get people try to intimidate you.  Like i say being more confident in yourself is easier said than done, thats why I think trying some style of martial arts would be a help to you in gaining confidence as well as learning to defend yourself if necessary.

The reason for this is its easy to assume malicious intent and bad case scenarios. A lot of the times you just wont know and theorizing negative can bring you for no reason, to no benefit for you. You can totally train yourself to reduce negative theorizing. Its hard though 

Also, if i were in your situation, and i was worried someone was getting in between me and a good, professional relationship (even if i weren't sure), id bring up the source of information for the reason i was doing things. I might leads with ""X was good enough to let me know i should be taking two hours, but I finished in 45 and checked my work multiple times, because i was worried i missed something. Do you think I missed something?"" Say it in a well meaning, sincere, non confrontational way, with both of them present. 
If your coworker had good intentions, it will be a nice way of letting the boss know of your coworkers kindness.  If he didnt have good intentions hes got a chance right there to save face but he will hopefully know not to fuck with you in that way. He might fumble through a weak or lame excuse if hes lying.  If hes got a problem with it youll have a chance to clear the air. If you got a troublemaker better to know up front than be fucked with behind your back.

I agree it's unhealthy to analyze every interaction I've ever had with this person. I only started to believe it was malicious because he continued to exhibit similar behavior after the incident I described in my post. Also, I said that I was taking two hours per return in front of my boss and this employee and he didn't say anything. He had advised me previously to take two hours so I think he should have mentioned this to my boss.

I did try to talk it out with this guy. It was difficult to get a full sentence out without being interrupted. He did finally let me finish though. He said he had no idea and that he would stop, but he continued to act in such a way.

He is also was very crass by nature. He would always make belittling and offensive comments as if they were innocuous. He would also lecture everyone on the most basic portions of the tax law. These lectures would also usually include several factual inaccuracies. I never mentioned the factual inaccuracies because I thought it would be rude. I really wish I had said something now!

I agree I need to be more forceful with other people. I actually tried to quit twice before I finally quit. I let my boss convince me to stay the first two times. I was finally able to do it the third time. My output while I was at that firm was actually quite good because I quickly realized that that employee was acting maliciously and I started going to another employee for advice. He was extremely helpful and actually gave me tax returns to do. I think my boss wanted me to stay on because my output was good. I was valued at that firm, but I just couldn't deal with all the negative interactions I had with that employee. Thank you for the advice though. I'll definitely apply it if I'm in a similar situation in the future.",t3_bidfbf
em0docp,t1_em0911m,"Well.. Sometimes people are meek to admit fault or jump into a conversation that they aren't a part of, or sometimes they arent paying attention.  I know of two good people who got some bad feelings over wrong info reported in a meeting that was actually the fault of the other, but it wasn't corrected on the spot by the person who gave the wrong info.. Anyway they cleared it up and became friends. I am not saying it will always be innocent but it can be. 

I think in general its good to correct factual inaccuracies, depending on the type of meeting you are in, like how formal it is, or if there are clients present for example. 

I feel if you are respectful, humble, and not antagonistic its a good practice to defend and speak up in these times. In some cases, it may be helpful to think of it as doing people a favor. Some people really don't want to offend, or give wrong information, and would be thankful to be caught before it got too far (maybe not the case with this guy). 

I feel like almost all workplaces will have a bad egg of some kind.. Like a bully, a know it all (who doesnt know anything), some who takes credit for the work of others.. What sounded good about that place is your boss seemed to appreciate you, and you had other coworkers you could get along with. I bet the other coworkers knew he was a jerk too. I feel a little bad for the boss.. A lot of times they dont know of their real problem employees because no one wants to tell. He will lose other good people if he doesnt find out. 

I think its sooo much worse when one of the really bad people are your boss or supervisor, or a social clique that behaves in a bullying way that dominates the office culture.

I'm not sure i would have left over one person who was not in a position of power over me.. But of course if you never leave to see what else is out there you might never know of that other, much better work situation. 

Anyway i am glad you got out of it with your head right.  You seem to have responded very reasonably too. Your self esteem and mental health are always worth protecting and standing up for. Good luck in your future!",t3_bidfbf
em0s1r5,t1_em0docp,"That place does have really high turnover. During the time I was there, four people quit, including myself. Three of them, including myself, were women. Another person, who I have remained friends with, just gave the boss notice that he was going to leave; so it will be five people in a year who have quit. You totally guessed right about other people at the firm hating that guy. All the accountants hate him. They all find his lectures marred with factual inaccuracies impossible to bear. Only the receptionist and the office manager like him.",t3_bidfbf

First off, thank YOU for your appreciation. I don‚Äôt do it for the glory, I do it because I want to. So thank YOU. 

You don‚Äôt need to be like anyone! Be yourself. Being yourself is the most alpha thing in the universe. As a man, you want to be ‚Äúalpha‚Äù. The leader of the pack, the man who people look at and say ‚Äúdamn, what does he do so different?‚Äù

Get yourself some goals first off, don‚Äôt ever say to yourself that people who look down on you achieve more than you, because that‚Äôs bullshit. What do they achieve? Pain and sadness from another person? Get outta here. Go be a letterman football player and be an asshole to people and tel me how much you achieve. 

What you gotta do is put EVERY SINGLE THING down and look at your life. Your mom or dad or whoever raised you right, because if they didn‚Äôt, you wouldn‚Äôt be getting picked on. You got so much going for you kid, so think of everything that you have become in your life and go move a mountain. 

You‚Äôre skinny and weak? Bullshit. What I hear is an empty canvas. Build your body on your own time, set goals and achieve them. Nobody says you have to be buff and toned. I have a bunch of skinny friends and they are some of the coolest dudes I know. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre an amazing guy, you just haven‚Äôt found it yet. When you do, you know where to find me. 

And remember, if it ever gets so bad to the point where you can‚Äôt take it anymore come back to this post and look at living proof that someone has lived through it.

elavv2t,t3_bf4947,"That's just the way everyone are, or a majority of people. They are usually selfish. They don't think about their actions and the consequences that follows. They don't care how others feel, only themselves. Regardless of their upbringing, they chose to be the bully. There are others who are not exactly bullies, but still chose to show indifference and apathy towards others. They tend to have this complex that they are better than most people, we all do. Some know-it-alls and elitists are an example of how some people aren't bullies but still just as bad, like a majority of people on the internet forums such as this site and many others. Also, young people in their teens, and even in their 20's are another one of those examples. Often times, they are judgemental, unfeeling, thoughtless, self centered, egotistical, and just plain indifferent towards others. Not once had they thought of anyone but themselves, not even towards people they don't even know, which is apparent on various internet websites and social media. It's part of the human instinct to be selfish, and a bit destructive, wether directly or indirectly. Whatever the case, they are the main cause of the problems we see in our lives. 

Not all of them are bullies, but people are still pretty bad. It's one of those instances where humanity should just end.",t3_bf4947
elbiz0m,t3_bf4947,"I can feel bad for anyone I choose to.  You demanding that I not feel bad is just another way to bully people into compliance.

But with that said, I have a bully at work, who delights in causing me physical pain.  I'm a disabled Veteran, and this woman intentionally stubs her shoes into the floor by me to make them scream, and with my tinnitus and hyperacusis, it causes me physical fucking pain.  The boss has been out sick for a few days, which means that this horrible person has been doing it whenever there's no one around except her minion.  It's like having sharp spikes driven into my ears.

I was thinking about that today at work after she'd been an asshole to me again, and I realized that she could die, and I'd probably feel, more than anything else, not sadness for the death of a person, not sadness at their partner's loss, but more than anything else, I'd feel a sense of relief.  Relief at knowing that she couldn't hurt me anymore.

I've put in complaints at work, emails to the boss -- sometimes daily -- even a hostile work environment complaint, a request for reasonable accommodation, and the chain of command has shot it down every damned time.  They know she's horrible, they know I'm depressed, even occasionally suicidal, and I sometimes wonder how it would look in the press if I offed myself because I just can't take it anymore, that the one Veteran they have, and a disabled one at that, took their own life because they just couldn't take any more of it, and command wouldn't do a goddamned thing to fix it.

If anyone out there is is in management or HR, take a hint: get rid of the bully.  If they threaten a lawsuit, let 'em.  Don't let one shitty human being ruin another person's life, or multiple people's lives.  Don't let them bring your organization down from within simply because they're a horrible human being.

I don't know if it's human nature, but bullying is really normalized and there is this mythos around it that it somehow makes you stronger. That implies of course that you were weaker before, therefore it must be your fault.

In case of teachers victim blaming though, I simply blame lazyness and lack of incentive to act. If they can pretend hard enough that the victim has some option to end the bullying, they can justify doing nothing themself. So blaming the victim for them simply makes the job easier.",t3_agvpwd

This has taken me over an hour cause I just wanna put this out there and clear my mind a little. 

 (it is long, I feel it will help those in need, so please take some time to read this, especially if you‚Äôve had a terrible day like I did just right now):                

Being lonely feels like having an endless void that needs to be constantly filled but it never gets filled. 
That‚Äôs how it felt for me all through school, I genetically have an anxiety disorder - I do not want to see a psychiatrist. There is no permanent cure you can take for anxiety. Anxiety medication is horrible and destroys the brain over time and it isn‚Äôt worth the side effects. 
Anyway -

Through school I never said a word to anyone from grade 3 onwards, especially as I got older and my disorder developed in a school environment. If someone was to speak to me, I would brake out in a tremor but would always be as polite as possible. Thus I became an easy target, and serious bullying followed in my later years when I changed schools in grade 8 and relocated into the bush. ( forest/mountains/nature ) *im australian btw. 

Anyway, back to talking about the hole void thing here with loneliness... 
That void that never got filled for me in school, got filled with severe depression in grade 5 after I started getting bullied by only the teachers due to my lack of team work, motivation and overall confidence. I swear the whole class would plan to be in on me. My teacher in grade 5 Mr. Frazer would ask a question, almost everyone puts there hand up, and I‚Äôm right at the front in the corner and he asks me and I wasn‚Äôt even sure what‚Äôs going on cause I was to depresssd to care and to anxious to speak. So then he‚Äôd just pretend to voice my voice in a stupid way and the whole class would laugh. This happened till grade 7 till I left the school. It toughened me up for sure, but made my anxiety disorder unbearable. 
Depression through school felt like a dead weight trying to pull me into the ground. Different to loneliness and it being a endless unfillable void. There was a school councillor that I saw but he left at the end of year 5 at my school and then there was never help or someone I could talk too. Every day at lunch time, I would be in the sick bay trying to convince the ladies I‚Äôm sick and need to go home. I would even make fake vommit out of fruit purae and uncooked vegies that come in noodle packets and pretend to throw it up out of my mouth outside the sick bay. 
After a while of doing that and being able to get home. It wore thin and the office ladies picked up on it and would just let me chill out in there for a while or kick me out. 

I eventually overcome depression in 2012 by riding my bicycle and listening to bands like AC/DC and parkway drive.. ( in grade 7 ) I was still depressed at school a little, and my anxiety was allot less because riding took my mind off things. 

I found a deep connection with nature because the only thing I enjoyed in life surrounding school, was riding my bike to school and having a passion for mountain biking. I felt more comfortable in the national parks riding my bicycle, then I did in my own room alone with school work. ( that‚Äôs how insane I was from school and my mental challenges )

Before I left my first school which I went to for almost 8 years, I had a huge accident on the way home from school on my bicycle in grade 7, I was lucky enough that one of my only friends who so happened to go the same school as me but wasn‚Äôt in the same class, saved my life the day I was riding home and crashed my bike. I do not remember the crash because I had a TBI ‚Äútraumatic brain injury‚Äù and had suffered from amnesia *could not remember anything at all 2 weeks even before the crash*. I was bleeding extremely bad and there are still stains on the road at Bond Uni. All I can remember is waking up from what was pretty much death, in hospital vomiting and my Mum by my side. 
I have no idea how I didn‚Äôt die. 
I guess everything happens for a reason. 

It was a 18 week recovery that flew by because I slept most of it *brain trying to repair itself* the only things I remember during my recovery was my grandma screaming at me for being into mountain bikes and random people from my school in my room. 
The left half of my face was completely swallon, beaten and scarred and I had missing teeth and a busted lip. ( I will try and find the photos and post them in this post if that‚Äôs possible ) - I‚Äôm all recovered now with straight teeth and the only scar I have from the accident is still a busted lip. 

I changed schools and locations after recovery from my TBI at 13 years old. Got bullied at my new school and was physically beaten for what I think was the 3rd time in the head at that school but this time serious resulting in a light concussion, even though I spent a short amount of time at this school ( 4 months to be exact ) during the day I got hit I planned not to return. The day after I had a concussion from getting bashed in grade 8 was the last time I came out of my room for almost a week. I did not move out of bed when mum or grandma was trying to take me to school. It got to the point where I had a complete melt down and then only my mum understood what must have been going on at school. even if my grandma dragged me there I wasn‚Äôt getting up-
 I did online homeschooling ( distance education ) with other kids online for 3 years but it never worked cause the anxiety was constant especially being on the internet where i would get bullied via Facebook from all the kids who use to go to my most recent school. 

 So I dropped out of home school by the time I was 16 (really it was 14 cause I had to much anxiety to even attend online class lectures), I had NO one and mountain biking took over my life and took me to Canada, whistler in 2016 at 17 years old for the summer season and I achieved a dream I had since I got my first computer and watched videos of mountain biking in Canada during some of the worst times of my life in school. 

Now I‚Äôm 19, I‚Äôve been genuinely happy and extremity healthy mentally and psychically for the last couple of months for the first time in almost 2 years, and I‚Äôve never felt better in my life.. 

From the start of 2017 to almost the end of this year, I was severely depressed and would be up from the afternoon till 4am in the morning. It was like I just didn‚Äôt want to live another day again. The scary thing is it took so long for me to work out why this was happening to me because it felt all to normal and familiar..

I only believe I recovered and came out of depression because I have only one person in my life who will support me forever.. 
I also came to a realisation that life isn‚Äôt for ever. Every day needs a purpose or to do something that is self fulfilling. With people or without. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Making memories is so important because when you make those memories you are in the moment and happy, all my best memories are things I experience on my own on my day to day basis..

Now I‚Äôve written all this tonight because I‚Äôve had a close mate from mountain biking try and bring me down during a phone call and I can feel anxiety coming back. 
If anyone tries to bring you down, you remove them from your life straight away, no positive thoughts observed associating that person. When someone tries to bring you down even if it‚Äôs your best mate, you talk to them seriously and open up. If they don‚Äôt want to listen and just Want to win an arguenment, they aren‚Äôt a real mate. 

Last 4 months of my life consists of. 
Meditation daily, gratitude practised daily. I Hike Mount Warning bare foot atleast once a fortnight for cardio exercise and brain clarity. I work for my mums Dyslexia company helping children who cannot read. 
I go to the local rock pools almost every afternoon now that it‚Äôs summer and boiling hot. 
I drive my 4wd and go camping. 
I have 3 dogs I look after that I love. 
I have a few little hobbies which includes body boarding, old Japanese cars, philosophy, history, online gaming. 

It took weeks of dedication to retrain my neurotransmitters to be active and not depressed 4 months ago. 
And drinking one cup of dandelion tea and mediating once a day has kept the anxiety away until just tonight üò™.. plus b vitamins. Exercise. Healthy eating. Omega 3. If you battle with things like me. Only you can put your mind to it to change that. It‚Äôs not complicated. Just need dedication to improve 

I would most likely have relapsed into long term depression if I never write this tonight after my mate literally called me to bully me on the phone with his other mate saying I‚Äôm going to put on weight again, become pale, lose all my hair, never do anything in life etc etc üòÇ
Find what you enjoy doing or what you think is interesting/awesome and keep on doing it or get into it! All your desires will come true kinda like mine sorta did I guess. Even if your desire is to have friends! Just be yourself first and do what you need to do and the right friends will just fall in place some way or another. 

I spend 90% of my time on my own now. Which is when I‚Äôm most happy, relaxed and free spirited. 
Hope this helps someone in need of relief of what ever they could be going through. 

If you put your mind to something you can do it. I was the last kid in school who anyone would have thought would achieve what I did before I relapsed into depression again last year..
Just remember my story if youre ever in doubt!

If you want to see my video from my candid trip before I relapsed back into depression feel free to message me

Peace ‚úåüèΩüá¶üá∫

ebvrnpy,t3_a6kdb3,"I have a rather similar trait. I appear very confident, and I can be funny and charming. But there is nothing beyond that. I cannot make connections above this superficial level. And the confidence is pretty much fake. It's a learned behavior, an act that became second nature... just not nature. It's based also in a deep conviction that I am unlovable, therefore, I have to act, provide and statisfy to make myself worthy. 

 I have tried describing that to a therapist before, but that was of little use, since I appeared very confident in front of her while I described how little confidence I have and how I struggle making connections. My modesty didn't much help either....I never try to make a big thing about my issues.

As for advice, I got none. I was only really able to connect my problems back to bullying last year, and this year was...closer to hell than I have been in a while.

What I would guess is, that I never really learned how to develop deeper connections with strangers. The time people usually learn that stuff in (for me, between, I assume, my memory is really bad, 4 and 18 there was always someone out there that had it in for me, with different intensities each year) was filled with constant abuse, so there are traits I simply never developed (not to assume stuff about you, but it is like that for me). Add that abuse-fuelled self-image issues, and this kind of trait we have seems like a logical conclusion.

So I assume healing would have to cure the negative self-image and based on that continue on to reteach socialization. But I'm just guessing.",t3_a6kdb3
ebwmpe3,t3_a6kdb3,"First, congratulations on the clarity of your career vision. Forensic Psychology is a great field, very complex and complicated, and quite lucrative once your are established as an expert witness.

There are multiple kinds of social skills. Your issue is about cultivating intimacy, not making small talk. To cultivate intimacy, you have to find people with whom you can mutually become vulnerable. Also you have to not continue to invest too much energy into people who are not available for intimacy. You have to not invest so much time into your work that you avoid addressing this problem. 

Cultivating intimacy requires empathy and attention focused towards other's pain and a willingness to talk about that pain. It also requires your willingness to discuss your own pain, and to value turn taking and reciprocity in the relationships you create so that you dont linger in lobsided relationships without correcting or rejecting them. You also have to understand and tolerate pacing as true and stable intimacy can't be built too quickly.

You are probably emotionally avoidant. CBT can help you have insight into the nature of the problem, which I imagine is connected to the bullying, but insight is not going to be enough. You need to act these things out in an exposure therapy sort of way to get past them. You need to do it, not understand it.  You will probably need a coach or therapist to help you recognize where you are stuck and to motivate your action as the pattern of avoidance is well ingrained. Try ACT rather than CBT next time you select a therapist maybe? Good luck.

ec2tde7,t3_a6kdb3,"I don't normally say this since my own experiences have been limited thus far. But since you seem to have tried all conventional routes, perhaps look into learning ""lucid dreaming"". I've read stories of how people have come to resolve traumas and mental health issues through it.",t3_a6kdb3
ebwh0cs,t1_ebvqtwn,"Thanks for the reply! I think it is not difficult for me to see I am capable enough manage my life to some degree. But, I would not say I have my shit together when it comes to other people. No matter how ""succesful"" I am, I still feel terribly lonely. 
I do not really have the exact voices in my head of what others used to call me either. I painfully remember them, but I do not have them in my mind in daily life. However, I still act like I do. Maybe I have internalised it or I don't trust others, but it is really difficult to put my finger on it. Thanks for you message again!",t3_a6kdb3
eceu9p6,t1_ecbws77,"Thanks for your input, bud! I personally had a fairly bad encounter with depression myself, so I can only commend you for getting out of that place. As for me, I recognise part of that story but something seems a bit different. Firstly, I like being with people and I want those intimate contacts, but usually I feel better by myself because of anxiety and mistrust. Second, I enjoy my work a lot. I am aware a large degree of stress is involved, but I think what I do is intrinsically rewarding; either I help someone get over their own hardships, or I figure out new methods to help those suffering. To me, the main problems seem to be trust and anxiety. As for how to deal with that: no clue.

I have furthered a lot of lifestyle changes. Like doing 5min workouts when I wake up, cutting out caffeine, eating more healthy, but also larger changes like moving out. I do feel the first smaller changes have been effective, but now I'll have to see if that extra freedom allows for some other positive changes as well. Thank you for your concern, and I wish you the very best!",t3_a6kdb3
ebwhnhk,t1_ebvrnpy,"Thank you so much for the reply. I recognise a lot in that story but it is really difficult to find out that you have such deep convictions. 

I do especially recognise the appearances problem. I am also described as too modest, and I never direct my negative emotions outwards. Last year I did a short therapy session because I believed that I was afraid that others think of me negatively, but at the end of the therapy I had learnt that I think that they think negatively about me while they may not even display behavioural signs of it. It is such a deep belief that I overlook it in day-to-day life, and even reasoning about it makes my insecure because I cannot analyse thoughts I am only aware of to a limited extent. 

Realising something is very wrong with you is very hurtful, and I have to admit I nowadays often think that I maybe should just accept that this is what I have become and live my life regardless of the issues I have. As for the connection thing you mentioned, I also recognise that but somewhat differently. Connections, or ""attachment"" as psychologists call it, are learnt very early in infancy. This attachment we form to parental figures (and sometimes others) is also predictive of how we approach relationships later in life. Teenage years are not specifically related to attachment, but it is a very sensitive period where you try to find out your identity. From what I've learnt, bullying tends to really cause severe problems in identity development which does seem to fit with developing that belief of being unlovable. 

Thank you again for your thoughts on the matter and I hope you are able to grow out of this yourself as well! :)",t3_a6kdb3
ebwnd87,t1_ebwmpe3,"Attempts at CBT have not exactly yielded promising results but your point about thinking about the people I let close is something that indeed seems warranted.

ebwk6wr,t1_ebwj5os,"Thanks man, you too. And as for the therapist part, it really means a lot to me that people say that. Usually in therapists with a history of problems are not held in such high regard in my university...",t3_a6kdb3
ebwkm2z,t1_ebwk6wr,"I can only judge that from my side, that of the patient: Last time I went into a therapy setting, I had no idea what was wrong with me. I didn't even know where to begin to describe. I didn't even know what to describe. The most outstanding issue back then was my depression, while a lot of my dysfunctional behavior and attitudes was regarded as normal by me.

I brought up that I was bullied for more than a decade, and it flew right past my therapist back then, just as the rather dysfunctional stuff I brought up along the way, as if it was completely normal. The therapy was as effective as you would imagine.....

I don't believe a patient could come to you, mention 10 years of peer-abuse on a sidenote, and not have that checked out.

It's one thing to know the theory about all that, but I think having experienced stuff like this gives you way finer antennas.",t3_a6kdb3

They're not healthy people. In psychology they call them 'everyday sadists' and they enjoy hurting and humiliating other people, especially the nice ones. You need to try and make new friends that will appreciate what you have to offer. Even if you're not super spiritual, church could be a good place to start as most families who go to church do so because they're seeking healthy, supportive relationships and that's a need that we all have.

One Sunday night I was so fed up with fear, that I agonized all night about my plan to sit at another table. The next day that's exactly what I did. I sat at another table with some people who I wasn't exactly friends with, but were friendly with. A couple of my friends came over and told me to come back to the other table, but at that point, I thought 'fuck you, if you were my friend you would have stuck up for me prior to me moving tables'.

doguuwx,t3_76sxui,"There's no question that it can have permanent consequences well into adulthood. I had to grow-up emotionally very early in life because I was being bullied badly at home and at school. A way of putting it is that I did not have a childhood. Stuff people would take for granted like ""playing"" with other kids, having ""pretend"" play and toys and all that stuff just wasn't part of my early life experiences.

Which means, as an adult, its one of the things that pushes people away from me. Guys especially expect women to be kind of playful and ""cute"" in their behavior and its just void from my personality.",t3_76sxui

I was conditioned to be a target and am currently in therapy trying to learn how to deal with it in the future.  I cannot leave my house alone and I am afraid to ever work again, because I know I will be targeted again and bullied incessantly.  It is hard learning that you were not at fault and that there is nothing wrong with you, it's even harder to believe it.",t3_76sxui

dok4pfh,t1_doi49gq,"Mmm. At first it feels like a reminder which it is, then it just continues. So far mine haven‚Äôt stopped either. The biggest thing I found to take away is that you‚Äôll know what to look for in the future. Example at my job I had a co worker that worked with me short lived because of how he was. I immediately recognized what kind of a person he was one I got to know him. I refused to allow him to get close like I had the people of my past and he wasn‚Äôt easy to give up either. Once he got fired I could rest easy again. It‚Äôs just little things like that you can recognize and use as a defense for yourself and possibly your children when they get to that point. In a weird way it‚Äôs like your self teaching yourself how to avoid those kinds of things in the future.",t3_76sxui

fy2w7ms,t3_hr97a9,"No you're not the only one. I was excessively bullied since the age of 7 until 15 for a multitude of reasons. I went through a french school, 2 American schools and now a British one (and we only have 6 foreign schools in my town). So I get it, and the kids were ruthless. Telling teachers about all the shit they did in and out of schools, the rumors, the cyberbullying, the threats, it did nothing. Even when I called in my parents for a meeting with the head of the school, things only calmed down for like 2 weeks and then got worse as obviously they said I was a tattle tell and what not. All I can say is that nothing really worked until I moved to this new school, its very new so small student body and I was a junior (rising senior) as there were no seniors and we're only 5 I was/am good, I only have senior year left and then its college. Oh yeah and I was bullied for being gay/bi in middle school (I thought I was a lesbian but later on came to the conclusion that I was/am bi). Anyways, a friend I trusted at school (one of the first people I came out to) thought it was okay to out me to two homophobic dudes and you can imagine the rest. People from two grades above would message my best friend asking if it was true and why it didn't bother her, dudes would stop talking to me and bully me more, give me weird looks, the girls would say rlly rude stuff e.x. ""so you like pussy now ?"",spread rumors that I would stare or peek in the bathroom (while I always minded my own business). I just wanted to stop existing at one point or go unnoticed, it was truly awful and messed me up but now 2 years later in therapy, I definitely improved a lot more mentally. 

 my dm's are always open, feel free to message me about anything <3 and fuck whoever thinks you're not valid or worthy or anything! You're valid to me and the rest of the LGBT+ community, our point is to love and support each other not hate! You deserved to be loved, feel safe, supported and cared for!! 

To anyone reading this, It's totally okay to move schools if you need to! I did until things calmed down, everyone told me I can't keep running away from my problems I need to face them, but honestly fuck that, If I didn't leave I probably wouldn't be here now... It's not weak, you're strong for knowing what's right for you and acting on it! It will get better, I promise, honestly I always thought this sentence was bullshit (and it might be for other stuff) but for bullying.... once you're out of Middle or High school it's completely different and ppl aren't as childish and close minded.

fsjddk7,t3_gscbkb,"You should ask that of your self.   Yes or no.  If you honestly feel like you don't then you need to create that.  When a person's self-esteem goes to shit or even the fact that they never truly learned how to have self esteem its very easy to let the value others place on taking hold.  Even if that's at 0.  However, this is not the true definition of who you are.  The real value comes from your self, it comes from building something from the ground up. 

The way I see it is that you didn't get much encouragement growing up, or at least not the kind you needed.  So you never had much of a chance to build your self up as such.  Understand its never too late.  You could be 99 years old and it would still not be too late.  

Ask your self honestly ""Do I count"" and respond as honestly as you can.  If the answer is no, or some variation thereof, don't make the assumption you have no value.   There is always potential there, something that you can do.  See it instead of a limitation you need to challenge and overcome.  Make that person in the mirror count to you.",t3_gscbkb

You will only cause yourself pain being around her and holding back your feelings. There is no way out. True friends take care of each other and if she was your true friend you would wish her to fulfil her dreams and be with whoever she wants. This crush is blocking you from being her true friend and causing you pain. Sorry to say it like this.

f7x1x08,t3_dxusvk,"I won't go into too much depth here, a lot of what I'm going to say is copy pasted. You may have heard some of it before, but don't take it for granted.

If you are psychologically impacted by these events:

1.) Depression and anxiety are common psychological consequences for bullying victims. As such commonly recommended tips do go a long ways in helping. Having a good exercise routine is essential. Although what defines a good exercise routine depends on the person. Some people prefer cardio exercises. Others prefer weight/strength training. Some people might feel satisfied exercising once or twice a week, while others may need to do so everyday. Find what your normal is and what your exercise preferences are.

Usually starting out small and gradually building up leads to the best long term results. Starting small can look like taking a walk around your neighborhood once a week. Or going for a 15 minute jog once a week. Over the course of weeks or months you can slowly increase the time and frequency of your sessions.

2.) Getting the right amount of sleep is important. For most people this is anywhere from 6-8 hours of sleep a night. Also sleeping at the right time to abide by the circadian rhythm is just as important.

3.) Seeking out therapy is very important. There is no shame in doing so. A therapist can offer advice and a different perspective on your situation. Finding affordable therapy can be challenging. Universities and colleges & high schools usually offer free counseling options for their students. Some workplaces these days offer benefits that include therapy sessions, so find out if your workplace offers these.

4.) Try meditation to deal with stress and/or depression. There are different kinds of meditation so find one to your liking (ex. Mindfulness, Deep Breathing, etc).

5.) Keep a journal. Write down your thoughts and anything else on your mind.

Finding Social Groups on meetup.com / Facebook / Reddit / Discord groups abound around the world.

That previous stuff I copy pasted from the stickied link (https://old.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/anesxq/some_tips_for_newcomers/)

One academic article I've found to be the most insightful and helpful on how to cope with bullying to date is this: ""Bully victimization and emotional problems in adolescents:moderation by specific cognitive coping strategies?"" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25156292)

If your in school or have a public library you can probably access and read the article for free. I think it's worth a full read, but I'll copy and paste the sections that I found to be most impactful in case you can't access it.

""8. Positive reappraisal, referring to thoughts of attaching a positive meaning to the event in terms of personal growth; 9. Positive refocusing, referring to thinking about joyful and pleasant issues instead of thinking about the actual event.""

""using other styles, such as Positive Reappraisal or Positive Refocusing people may be more resilient.""

""Firstly, when helping an adolescent to cope with bully victimization, it could be important for health care professionals to assess to what extent the adolescent uses self-blaming, rumination, or catastrophizing in response to bully victimization. Secondly, the adolescent could be assisted to become more aware of and to challenge these maladaptive cognitive coping patterns and to acquire new, more adaptive strategies such as positive refocusing or positive reappraisal.""",t3_dxusvk

Sometimes it takes a while before you find your tribe. It took years for me. When I was in middle and high school, even for a while in my twenties, I was exactly where you are now. No friends and it seemed as if no one care if I lived or died. The friends I thought I had only used me for what they could get. 

But one day I finally decided that I was better off by myself then with friends like that. And I stopped giving a damn what other people thought. That was the day my life changed and slowly, I started attracting friends who were genuine and caring people. Now, I have a circle of friends who love me for me and we often take trips together! I eventually found my tribe and they celebrate my little quirks and idiosyncracies because, believe it or not, we all have them! Around them, I'm not judged and can be weird when I want to!

First she tried talking to her and asked her about it. In a very nice way and not making her feel ""accused"". Unfortunately, the daughter did not reacted well, so my friend decided to go talk to the school staff/teachers and asked them to keep her updated about her daughter's behaviour and also asked about the girl who she was bullying. When her daughter did not stop and things got even worse, she decided to call the mother of the the girl whom she was bullying and invited them over for dinner at her place! My friend made her daughter apologize to this girl right there in the table! And told her ""I am in contact with *name of the girl* and her mom and everytime I hear you bully her I am going to invite them for dinner and you're going to apologise! - my friend's daughter finally left this poor girl alone, haha.

eyaldey,t3_cw640o,"Based on your comments, I wonder if it is truly bullying. Bullying has to be repeated. The school handbook should have some info on bullying and the school district should have a policy too. 

If the school is a good one, they should seek to understand before punishing. Do your best to be open-minded while standing up for your child. How is the school going to support her so that she is less likely to get in trouble again? How do they expect her to react if she is attacked again?

Another thing is to journal, as in write things out physically, it's qualitatively different from typing them on a keyboard.

So keep your hard earned  effort. 

Maybe even keep posting here to vent.. And save it to share later, when you are ready.

I encourage you to try therapy again. Its normal to have to go through a couple of false starts. It might take awhile to find a good ""match."" Its ok.
It might be worthwhile to find out if there are therapists who specialize in adult survivors of child abuse on your area. Im not familiar with the field but it could be worth a shot. 

Theres also groups like this: http://www.naasca.org/
Maybe can help you find leads? Maybe a support group? Again im not familiar with the group. You can google ""naasca yourstatename"" if you're in the US, they have resources by state. The point is youre not alone. Theres a whole bunch of people who were abused as kids that are adults now. Just hard to find because people like to hide such things :( just like you, no?

You seem like such a caring guy, who loves his kids. Maybe you feel some shame about the irony of you being a big tough guy on the outside but so injured inside. I hope you will keep trying to find help, so you can be your best self, for your kids, and for your own well being.

etcbvtg,t3_cask85,"My recommendation is to figure out what is working, what isn't and to share that info here. A child living with a bully parent is probably the most awful situation because you can't really escape that easily.

I think 99% or more of us who were significantly bullied carry a strange sort of weight that is hard to explain, easy to ignore, but its there. The only thing I've found that works is to find positive outlets for that negative energy. So for me, instead of thinking how much I hate people, I think about how to bring people more together. 

You might find this forum more useful than therapy. It's like AA - the only person who can help another drunk is someone who's been there. If you want to do more than help, I have an online forum and school that starts with fixing the bullying problem first, adults are welcome.

et7799e,t3_ca3b5d,"Eh nothing to be ashamed about. Having played video games for many years this sounds pretty normal, not uncommon by any means. Just don't go putting so much trust in and getting connected to people you don't even know at the end of the day. Online is not a substitute for real life interactions.

I mean watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euy7zPm3ypM

A lot of people just play games online simply to vent and talk shit, not to actually play the game believe it or not. And some people have shit lives where their performance in game is the only thing good about them, and they put a lot of their self worth behind that in game performance. This has been the story for more than a decade.",t3_ca3b5d
etbptte,t3_ca3b5d,"Wow no need to be shamed by this. I'd tell my sig other and friends about it too. You can get together and verbally bash this random psycho to help you let off steam.

One of the dangers of internet socialization is that people can behave badly with no consequences AND the person on the receiving end of the bad behavior will deal with it in a vacuum of social support from their real world peers. You don't have to do that. 

Think of it like some one you play tennis with on occasion and know them only on the court. If they went nuts and started talking shit to you, you'd tell your friends right? Then they'd validate your feelings, which is good even if you already know you're in the right. This normal rallying of support for yourself isn't something you should deny yourself because it was ""just online."" The feelings and words were real. So go on. Share.
Let them help you laugh it off, or be angry at that douchecanoe with you. Maybe they will tell you not to go on there again. Maybe you'll do it anyway. But whatever you choose, keep them included. It's all part of life. No be shame :)",t3_ca3b5d

Let's face it...what do you have in common with people who belittle you and your parents? Nothing. You deserve better.
So if sports aren't your thing, consider an art class at the local art museum ( many times scholarships are available for class fees to be waived)  or community college ( yes, they may consider you even if you're still in high school) , a book club, committees at school etc...meet others who challenge you to grow and strengthen your self- esteem. And, you owe this group of abusers no explanation for not being there with them.

I've known some people out there to have darker humor. They'll poke fun at people but they'll also laugh with you if you insult them back. I don't think those people are necessarily bullies. 

Poking them back with a good comeback is a good litmus test for what kind of person they are. If they tell you not to be offended, but get offended if you say something back to them. Probably means they're assholes. Would be a good idea to slowly distance yourself from them and find some new friends and activities to participate in. Tell them your busy with other things if they ask you why your not hanging out with them anymore.

1.) Prepare yourself, I‚Äôm about to bring a concept into this which I feel you could use. Gandhi created this concept called civil disobedience. It‚Äôs a form of nonviolent or peaceful means of protesting. It‚Äôs when a civilian protests without the use of violence and in most cases controls his or her emotions to behave in the opposite of the expected norm. There is a psychology technique or concept of this, I forget the jargon or terminology for it but basically you react opposite to what is expected. Essentially, when this guy bullies you, you smile and give him a compliment. You say something nice about him. For example, you could compliment some trait about him. 

Btw, watch this link. This should seriously help:
https://youtu.be/7oKjW1OIjuw


2.) You could pretend he is literally invisible and does not exist in the room. Now this may be harder and more inevitable because you might always have to deal with him. Basically, pretend he is empty space and there is no one there. When he says something horrible, pretend that you hear a fly buzzing, look out the window, greet someone else, talk to a coworker, anything just do not let anything he says faze you.

3.) I just thought of this now. This isn‚Äôt really an option but just a form of legal punishment you could take: Get a restraining order. Maybe that could solve the problem...",t3_btr4kv

*the full story is on my profile also a pro revenge story* 

They‚Äôre throw rocks at me and when I just about make it last then I receive a few punches in the face and end up going home with cuts and bruises they used a compass to try and stab me once! 

I tried to tell my head of year teacher what was going on but of course she did nothing she was more concerned about my appearance and also it was outside of school they wouldn‚Äôt do shit 

So I had to either take the long way home which avoids them completely or take my chances and take my short way home and hope they‚Äôre not there or I managed to come and go before they did! 

My dad was very concerned why I came home with cuts and bruises I told him a lie some kids were throwing rocks and bullying another kid and I got caught up in it

Well when I walked home one day it was raining so I thought let‚Äôs go home quick but someone was following me didn‚Äôt know who but I thought crap just get home quick when I came to the boys throwing rocks and punching me 

It turned out the guy following me was my dad he watched those boys punch and kick me while I was pushing past and that‚Äôs all he had to see before he lost his shit! 

He grabbed one of the boys by the neck and trust me he wanted to hurt him sooo bad but he knew he couldn‚Äôt so he just threatened him

It scared that boy soo much and I tell you it never happened EVER again! 

If you‚Äôre older and maybe much taller than your brothers bully..... I‚Äôd advise this as a last resort

At the end of the day people do anything to protect the ones they love right? 

I took after my dad after that my cousins niece got bullied when I took her to an arcade she was playing on the dance machine and one boy just hopped on it infront of the screen and pushed her off and took over when I saw that I grabbed that shit stain by his jacket and slammed him up against another machine... pushed him to the floor grabbed his wallet and took ¬£1 out and said ‚Äúthat should cover another game for her since you stole hers!‚Äù Threw his wallet back at him kinda helped him back up and pushed him with my foot like kicking his ass and he never bothered her again ",t3_b82akz

I have been told by any number of women that I dated that I'm ""not someone I would usually date"" or straight-up that they didn't find me attractive.  And that was ***before*** the army.  I had my face rebuilt, added a bunch of scars, etc.  I am **not** a pretty man.

But I have the benefit of a few generations time on this planet that you have not yet experienced.  I could give some long-winded diatribe of advice (and still might, who knows?), but in short, fuck 'em.  They're young, they're ignorant, and right now, they think they're on top of the world.  In my experience, life is not kind to people like this.  They tend to favor assholes who call themselves alphas and then they find out much to their dismay, the guys are assholes.  They deserve each other.

What I did with my situation -- my own mother could not bring herself to call me attractive, but hey, thankfully, they signed me over to the state, so I've got the experience of bouncing from one foster home to the next going for me -- but I what I chose to do with my situation was to work on myself.

I have found that what people want -- everyone, irrespective of gender or who they're attracted to -- is they want someone whose company they enjoy, and they feel safe with.  Read books so you have interesting things to contribute to conversations and in class.  Work out -- yes, exercise is your friend -- like it or not, we're animals, and teenagers both awash in pheromones, and the combination of being nice to everyone (not to assholes, mind you, they don't count, but don't provoke them if you can help it, they tend to enjoy hurting people, so avoid them when you can) and passing someone after a good workout can do wonders for what that person thinks of you.

Practice good hygiene.  Wash your face regularly, take good care of your skin and drink plenty of water.  Eat nutritious food, not junk food all the time (not saying you do, just mentioning it in case).  You're 16, so establish good habits now.  The young girls who were awful to me in high school are now old women, and I am an old man.  I like to think I have done a lot with my life, and hopefully, been of service to people.

What matters is character.  When people look back at who you are now, let them say, ""He was good to people, he worked hard, he was a decent bloke.""

I have lived a good number of years now, and I have awards and medals, etc., from my time in the military and law enforcement, federal service, etc.  The 2 compliments I treasure are as follows:

1. A little boy asked if I could be his daddy.
2. A woman told me she always felt safe when I was around.

I always know my surroundings, I always have a way out of every situation and environment I enter, I am always armed and I swear to god I'd rather start killing people than be a victim ever again.

It changed nothing about the feelings I have for myself. There are days I genuinly hate myself. I find myself pathetic, weak, disgusting and repulsive. And nothing I ever did could change that and I tried working on that a lot, by myself. I honestly for a long time didn't think that the bullying was to blame for those feelings, because I've rode the wave of ""bullying toughens you up"".

Bullying is a traumatic experience, and depending on who you are, what happened to you and how long it went on, it can have the same outcomes as child abuse and molestation, armed victimization and all other kinds of abuse and trauma. Science found that the peer group has massive influence on a childs development, with some arguing the influence is equal or greater than that of the parents. So it doesn't amaze me that research indicates that bullying can be as traumatic as abuse and neglect by parents.

I was bullied in middle school too, luckily never physically, but being made fun of for being ugly and Asian did their damage for sure. Reading thru your Reddit history, all I can say is you have to find a way to let it go. What happened in high school happened then. I'm not saying what those bullies did was right, they were young dumb and insecure kids. I work with children and they are mean, nasty, and will pounce on any sign of weakness. That's how some kids are when they get to a certain age. I'm not trying to excuse their actions but I am trying to say it's possible to forgive and forget. Focus that hate and anger towards other areas of your life. If you work on your self development and spiritual growth, I hope that it brings you some internal happiness. Don't worry about the external like other people or relationships. Those will only bring temporary relief. The only thing that can bring everlasting peace and joy is what goes on inside our head. I wish you the best in your life. ",t3_af59dz

e2uox80,t3_910iwr,"I don't understand this myself. 

My guess is that a lot of bullying victims probably want to put their bad experiences behind them and not revisit bad memories. That and maybe shame, since bullying is basically being dominated. Also lack of trust.",t3_910iwr

e2vmabs,t3_910iwr,"I'd join any that might exist. CPTSD from grade school abuse by peers. It doesn't seem to get taken seriously when it's called bullying, and when you properly call it abuse you get accused of exaggerating. There was no win. I just try to avoid people now.",t3_910iwr
e2vzqwx,t3_910iwr,"I wonder how many bullying victims that were mentally scarred from it realize that this is due to bullying. Or give the bullying the credit it deserves. Sounds stupid, but that was the case with me. 

My bullying ended with me fighting back against them, after 6 years of heavy peer-abuse, 2 years of rather low intensity bullying. I fought a lot of dudes, and 2 years later it finally stopped. 
The classic ""happy ending"" for bullying. My thinking back then was, that bullying made me stronger and more resilient. Thinking back, I exhibited tons of signs of PTSD, flashbacks, nightmares, hypervigilance, social withdrawal, emotional nubness etc., back then, but who would have told me? In the midst of my bullying in grade 6 I was forced to see the school psychologist (for ""denial to perform""...yeah...), and she didn't recognize anything either and didn't adress the bullying at all (I think, that should have got her fired). 

So how on earth would I have recognized this? My bullying began in grade school, likely in kindergarten before that, I know I was an outcast, but not much more, so I didn't have any comparison to what it means to be normal, because a ""normal me"" never developed. 

My first crash, massive depressive episode, anger outbursts etc. came in grade 12, when I tried to socialize more and was often immobilized by social anxiety, yet I also often performed well in social situations, and I could not understand why the hell I performed well sometimes, and was stunted other times. At this point, I thought the bullying was behind me. 

The same in my second crash, I was seeking help for depression and sleep problems, but nothing else, I did not know where this came from (I didn't seek help for social anxiety, because I rationalized that I could meet new people whenever I wanted to, I just choose not to....yeah...), because again, bullying ""toughened me up"" and was behind me. 

Only when therapy failed completely I was looking for other explanations, and only 1 year after that I found out, what actual impact bullying can have, and I read and heard about how other survivors were doing.

And when I consider my story, I am not amazed there are not more people here. Bullying is truly normalized. It's still put off as a rite of passage, something you beat yourself out of and never think off it again. Compare this sort of normalization to spanking or to circumcision, both being proven to be traumatizing and harmful for childrens development, how long did that take to realize? And both is still widely practiced. 

Add that to the toxic shame that is part of the trauma from prolonged bullying and the narrative that bullying victims must have done something wrong, or been freaks to deserve being bullied, and ask yourself how many victims will rather think they are deeply flawed, then mentally scarred from bullying? I did think that.  

In a few months I can go looking for therapy again, since now my insurance wont pay jack. I wonder how many therapists I can work through until I find someone taking bullying seriously. ",t3_910iwr

To be honest, the people who did or is currently doing those things to you probably have no idea.

I started contacting some of the tormentors from my childhood last year. Most chose not to respond. I‚Äôve had two block me on social media. I‚Äôve had one apologize and acknowledged her behavior during that time was a way to cope with abuse she was experiencing in the home. She wasn‚Äôt trying to defend her actions, but was explaining why she acted out the way she did back then. It really didn‚Äôt have anything to do with me. I was just a shy, quiet awkward boy who was bullied and not-well liked, so I guess I was the person you went to terrorize whenever you wanted to feel better about yourself...

I‚Äôve even had one claim he had no recollection. He then told me, ‚ÄúThat was so long ago. We all have problems. Get over it.‚Äù

I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre still in school? If so, your brain is still developing and the experiences happening now will affect you in the future. The past shapes our future, and today is the foundation you‚Äôll build tomorrow on. Get control of things ‚Äúnow‚Äù while you still have the chance.

I want you to know I was also bullied pretty badly in high school and was a cheerleader, and that weird dynamic made me so uncomfortable. I cried almost every day. You‚Äôre absolutely entitled to have feelings about it and be angry. 

Many years later I still go to therapy to address group bullying. It definitely helps. In my experience as I got older I was able to let go and forgive, but I don‚Äôt think I would have gotten there without therapy. Your feelings are real feelings and they are valid not matter what. It did get better for my as I processed over the years and got older. I know it‚Äôs hard to see, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And you are worth it!",t3_grmzz8

Make him feel like, he is the most useless thing in the office.

If he being physical, well guess what you‚Äôre not in school anymore, you can always report this jerk.

This is how i deal with this type of people, usually i treated them nonchalantly, as if they disgust me, they will soon avoiding you out of embarrassment. Bullies crave reaction, so  don‚Äôt give them one or better make them feel worthless.",t3_ergmj2

This new guy doesnt talk to anyone, who sits by themselves at lunch and barley talks works with people. It sounds like you dont talk to other people either so they are probably thinking the same thing about you. Because your so quiet, they could think you dont like them. Be honest with the guy. He could think you hate them, and maybe just dont know you have anxiety. I shudder at work, but because I told the people around me when my anxiety isn't going well that day they help me out and I acually like my job now. And if they are still acting like an asshole even after they know then you should point out they are being an asshole. 

But I know it's hard. Its your first job, and everything is new scary. But to them, they just see you as the new guy and could possibly be going through the same thing as you.

You can buy a pen on Amazon that has a tiny audio/video recorder in it. No one can tell it‚Äôs a recorder because it looks just like a pen. Just clip it onto your shirt pocket. I did this at one job I had. It wasn‚Äôt a bully I was recording, but this other co-worker who would literally have screaming tantrums in front of patients.

Don't let her deflect the issues by letting her frame herself as a victim.  She did something wrong and needs to acknowledge it.

fegqfsk,t3_efur7n,"Sorry to hear about your narcissist of a so-called 'sister.' Egocentric people like her are just incapable of an apology and will always see everything as revolving around themselves. She really reminded me of my ex-friend who was sisterly with me during childhood, but in high school often incited the bullies to attack me (one time even with a knife), and then complained to everyone who would listen - even including my parents - how the guilt from her actions/not defending me was apparently 'killing her.'

Make an excuse to go out whenever your sister is around. Give your sister the silent treatment if you just can't be around her and block out every single word she says. (Easier said than done, I know) And let your parents know this is happening but if they refuse to help then it's time to start making steps to move out and distance yourself from the lot of them. You are the most important priority in your life, and should protect and value yourself first and foremost of all.

(And it is truly horrid  when your family start emulating the bullies you used to face: My own mother has been telling me things like I'm unattractive without make-up, that I'm not 'cool' for not getting drunk on alcohol/smoking weed like my peers etc. Good thing I don't live anywhere near her.)",t3_efur7n

Yes, that was bullying, and from what you describe it sure does sound like it traumatized you, so I would suggest getting the proper help for that!",t3_dwbnce

f7ie7k6,t1_f7ia0s1,"I agree with this.. And it actually does sound like the kind of things some kids will do just to try it of to fuck around and think its no big deal. And it does sound like gaslighting style bullying that some kids might think is hilarious or get caught up in the fantasy and actually believe. 

Think about the slenderman stabbing girls. One was legit sick but i think the other just got caught up in the narrative. This is just an example of how far non-psychotic kids can get caught up in some dreamed up story and hurt others without stopping to check themselves.  Another example I can think of is once when I was in elementary school one ""ringleader "" type somehow got practically the entire class chanting that one of the students was dead, *while that student was in class*. I dont know how or why it started and i wasn't doing it but it was fucking surreal and i remember just watching this thinking wth is going on. I wasn't even the target of that mass student freakout and it still weirds me out to this day. You sound like you were victimized by a ringleader and a  hoard of these ""playing along"" people which can absolutely be traumatic because of the sheer number. 

I really really suggest you get a good therapist for that asap. Theres no reason for you to wait around a few more years to see if you magically get over it on your own. You seem to doubt how seriously you should take it.. Well get to a professional.. If its no big deal itll be over fast.. If it is a big deal, they can help you.

See if she is able to manage her emotions while there, but talk to her daily about it. If nothing changes....GET. HER. OUT. and either move schools or homeschool her. If you are unable to homeschool her, then fight as hard as you can with teachers, principles, parents, until your daughter is old enough to stay home in a more peaceful environment where she can take online and even college classes.

I‚Äôll be honest i dealt with bullies from year 7-10 and I probably will in year 11 because I seem to attract a holes and all I did was try not to react and get into a fight.

As a teenager, everyday incidences of being called homophobic slurs, and attacks on my appearance hurt me more than the occasional ""flare-ups"" where the bully acted out toward me aggressively - either by physically attacking, sexual assault via groping and butt-poking, unsolicited photo taking, screaming, setting off fire works around my house, horn honking, banging on my door, or damaging my belongings. When the bullies act out aggressively toward me in these ways it bothers me less.

evbxn70,t3_cj2fh0,Cant say I agree. I think its a mistake to attempt to change your behavior to appease bullies. Bullies dont target people because of the way they act. They target them because they see them as a convenient stepping stone to greater popularity. Build confidence in your ability to defend yourself. Work out. Take martial arts if possible.

I like what you said about people telling on them and having mandatory lessons on this; well that it only makes the problem worse.

You are smart, and you will still need to deal with people like that in the future; people acting out and others going along with that. There will be people you notice in your future where some company makes this horrible product that barely even works. The workers too afraid to tell their boss the thing does not work. Instead they help make this product so they still benefit making money at their job. Going along with their bosses poor design of the product. Those people working there are the same people you are talking about at your school. You on the other hand have much more substance than them.

Our parents should do much more watching out for bullying, or enabling behavior when their kids are at home. Our friends are then encouraged, trained to stand up to the ones they know who are bullying (or the ones going along with it). Normally when a person acts out of line they are afraid of being embarrassed in front of the others, but that requires the majority of the group to be normal, and thus respond in healthy ways.",t3_citcdk

evd20x4,t1_evbp6bg,"I'm with you on everything you have said. The last part of your message though has me confused. If this insecure person turns into a bully to be noticed by others, to be popular. Then the people around him will also go along with that bullying. These people who enable the bully do so because they are also insecure, want to be liked. If one of these people felt that this is wrong and stood up to him then they risk being noticed and rejected (bullied too, by the group which they use to belong). So now we have a group of people who do as they want, with no checks and balances within the group of people. So no, I disagree with you my friend. You do not live this life only thinking about that change is something we have control over ourselves. It is a system of people, and you belong to that system. If something needs fixing then you apply the appropriate steps to handle that person, or group.
So in the above example people are afraid to do what is right because they would rather be silent and enjoy the benefits of being liked by a group. Even seeing them hurt someone, their benefit of the group outweighs the horrible things they witness ""and"" take part in. Because a bully can not get away with it unless others go along with it. 
In a new example that would be healthy you see this instead. When a person bullies he would worry about being embarrassed in front of others while acting that way. he would worry his friends would find out and loose his friends. He would worry that the school would suspend him, and loose his standing with his family at home. So this shows just how many people enable a bully (I listed them just then). 
The phrase ""you should first start change with yourself"" really means something else here. People often tell others how to act, and in a lot of cases that is needed as we just mentioned before. But often we also just tell others what is expected of them never once thinking how we look ourselves to the world. If we admit what is wrong with us instead of ""always"" looking what is wrong with others, the emphasis on ""always"". 

As far as changing people. Alice Miller said it best. You have to confront the people who have hurt you. It is done with pressure until they become a better person. Pressure from their friends, family, and school (in this example). The only way they can get away with it is from those not doing a thing while it goes on. All it takes for a bad thing to happen is have sufficient good people just standing around looking up at the sky while it happens. Alice Miller is a person worth checking into. 

Knowing what you know now, you can then see what politics are. There is an elephant in the room, and no one wants to admit it. The emperor has no clothes. AND, the one about nice guys finish last, and no good dead goes unpunished. ALL of those quotes come from the very same things you are seeing at school. People go along, they intimidate those who confront them, and horrible ideas come about because no one is brave enough to say it is wrong.",t3_citcdk

esdv5el,t3_c78lbx,"I stood up for friends against bullies and it put the target on my back. I was bullied for years after and somehow my friends always managed to disappear when it happened. One - a supposed best friend before I knew what real friends were- actually told me that I should have know better than to draw attention to myself.
 
One exception was in elementary school. It was actually the first time I ever stood up to a bully. I was in 1st grade and a 4 th grader was tormenting a group of kindergarteners. I got in front of him and started yelling at him to leave the kids alone. He grabbed me by the shirt and was hollering in my face, saying he was going to punch me. Then the kindergarteners (3 of them) surrounded him and started yelling at him to put me down. They were more allies than friends but it got the job done.
 
My daughter (12) has defended friends against bullies since she was 8 ( she knows we have her back and feels empowered to help her friends). As a result, after seeing her raise issues with teachers and administrators in defense of her bullied friends, she has a couple friends who now defend her when the bullies try to strike (which is often in jr. high).
 
So maybe part of the issue has to do with how much support defenders feel they have. My daughter knows my history of being bullied and how awful it is. But she also knows that if someone messes with her I have no problem playing hardball with her school to get it stopped immediately (did so a couple of times over the years). So while she‚Äôs annoyed by the target on her back when she defends friends, she isn‚Äôt afraid to do so because she is confident that if it escalates she has the power of her parents behind her. And equally as a result she has a great reputation as a defender in her school and her teachers are more likely to take her concerns seriously so aside from letting me know, she doesn‚Äôt needs my help.
 
So, maybe when friends don‚Äôt defend each other from bullies it is because they feel or they know they don‚Äôt have their parents behind them, they would be alone in the battle, and thus likely to lose. Everyone is so painfully alone in the struggle.  I know there are kids out there who become toadies because they‚Äôd rather corrupt themselves and be awful to someone than be bullied themselves.",t3_c78lbx

I was bullied pretty badly my 7th grade year. Pushed into lockers, someone threw asphalt at my head, and this guy wanted me to fight him but I wouldn‚Äôt.

esdx9q1,t1_esdwc61,"Thanks. As a parent now, I am astounded as to how isolated bullied kids are. It seems like it honestly takes a lot of looking the other way or not taking kids misery seriously to perpetuate the toxicity going on.
 
Much of what bullies kids go through, would have adults calling the police. Not to disregard adult bullying (especially workplace bullying ). But that is usually more subtle and I believe the seeds of it in both perpetrator and victim are sown in the schools. Certain behaviors that are deemed acceptable and ‚Äújust kids being kids‚Äù are outrageous violations.

Get away from your bullies.  If you're in a small town and there is a network of people bullying you, that will almost certainly mean moving someplace else.  The bullying is unlikely to follow you.  Your current location and the assholes in it are not the world.

Get back at your bullies; make them fear bullying you further.  What will be possible or effective (and what you can get away with) will vary from situation to situation and person to person.  If you want to go with any kind of legal route, I'd suggest keeping a journal of bullying incidents and information about your bullies you can use later; and if you're in a single-party-consent jurisdiction, record voices whenever you're around these people, and save any recording containing a bullying incident.  

If you have any recourse at all against these people, start documenting what's happening.  In your documentation, don't just describe their demeanor or how they made you feel.  State what they actually did.  Subject - action verb - object.  ""So-and-so struck me.""  ""So and so said such-and-such to me.""

I'm smart, outspoken and never let anyone get away with anything they said or did. When they hit me I hit them back. 

But did it ever stop them? Did it heck.

When I tell people I was bullied they say if I ever hit them, because if a bully is intimidated they wont hurt you. That is a lie. I hit them, they took it as a challenge. They do not stop.

I struggled from being year 8 to year 11. I don't have behavioural issues. I wasn't super poor and I wasn't super smart (I was in the top sets but quite far from being the smartest). I shouldn't have been a victim.

You're not bullied because you're aspergers, you're bullied because they are arseholes. And I highly suggest you get counselling or some therapy after you leave school because you will have picked up very unhealthy coping mechanisms, because I know I did and I wish I had realised sooner.

I'm glad they have gone elsewhere and you can have your final year in peace. But don't underestimate the damage they have done.

eo5hnem,t3_bpozsu,"I have bullied one person in my entire life, and it was only because one person in my seventh grade friend group was jealous of that girl. It was an experience that taught me a lot about the toxicity of peer pressure and the impact of words. I'm very ashamed of it now, but this girl handled it REALLY well, so here are the actions she took that made us back off:

&#x200B;

\- **She surrounded herself by a couple of acquaintances** whom I believe she trusted and that kinda made us feel like idiots to single out a girl who has support, although we still continued the bullying.

&#x200B;

\- When she was alone, she was always either reading a book or listening to music. Trust me, bullies hate it when their victims **don't acknowledge them or are unfazed by their actions,** so if you continue with this **""unbothered attitude""** for enough time, they'll realize they can't tear you down, and they'll leave you alone. TD;LR don't give them the power.

&#x200B;

**- She informed the school's counsellor,** who called us in for a meeting, gave us a long lecture about bullying, what it can do to a person, how horrible the girl was feeling, and at the end told us that if she receives one more complaint from the girl, she'll contact our parents, inform them about the situation, and suspend us from school. We were really embarrassed (deservingly so) and we didn't go near the girl for two weeks, then I apologized to her (I genuinely didn't realize how horrible we were being).

&#x200B;

More Advice:

\- Please do not commit suicide. These people aren't worth *anything*, let alone your precious life. Groups like these exist in almost every normal school, and you just happen to be the target of this one group. That says NOTHING about you, so it's absurd that you're starting to believe their comments. Do not change your self for their acceptance: do you even *want* acceptance from people like *them?* This is important because once you do change, it would be really difficult to turn back.

\-  I know some public schools don't take bullying as seriously as they should, and this is why I think you should **tell your parents.** I know, it can be difficult to admit to your parents that you can't deal with this on your own, but they have a powerful voice. Make use of it.",t3_bpozsu
enwfcob,t3_bpozsu,"This was me....same situation....in high school. Here are some options to handle the situation. 
A. Inform the school. ( Even if you think they are aware --- state it verbally. Repeatedly, if needed. It's their responsibility to keep you safe while you are on school grounds.) Make sure your guidance counselor knows and helps you plan next year's classes away from this crew...as much as possible. 
B . Make sure your parents are aware. Their support is powerful. They can stay in contract with school.
There ARE Parents Advocates available through the schools themselves which act on behalf of families. Your school's Board of Education will direct you to them. (Call the main number of your Board of Education. The operator will direct you further.) 
C. Have your friends rally around you and by your side. Their very presence can make a difference.
D. Realize they are probably jealous of you. This was my case and this is  the cause of this type of harassment. Whatever the cause, though, don't change who you are for them.
E. Harassment is illegal. You may wish to contact someone in the legal community to assist with this situation. My sister-in-law did this for my niece and the problem was soon resolved.

&#x200B;

ldk why you are forced to interact with this group/ these individuals. maybe they live nearby or you are in school together. even if they seem to be unavoidable, you have to always remember that they influence a very small corner of the world. you have all the time and possibilities in the world, maybe that's what these people hate on. you can choose to be somewhere else because it sucks where you are. you did not cause this so choose not be the victim of it.

in all probability, these people are terrible toward each other and will tear each other apart if they did not have someone to crap all over.

I'd talk to your office manager first. Not in the moment, separately. Tell him frankly, especially as he appears to have seen it, that you have already requested the behavior to stop and you are not being respected. This is a problem you want assistance with. You would like this to remain cordial, but the behavior has to stop.

I'd be interested in knowing if there was a separate HR department? Generally those should be sectioned away from managers to better allow for this kind of thing. 

If neither of these are doable, seek outside assistance [https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/crc/2011-workplace-harassment.htm](https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/crc/2011-workplace-harassment.htm).

It may not be physical, but it still leaves wounds, and based on what you said, you're already starting to feel them. It will be all right to keep being a temp for a while. To seek other employment.

elu8v33,t3_bhjw09,"I feel the same way. I have ideations about hurting the people who have hurt me. I feel bad about it, but I want to make them feel as horrible as I do or worse.

I'm years out of school (26 y.o), but women never change. I don't say that to discourage you, but I think you should stand up to her in a realistic way. The best thing I ever said to a bully in 6th grade was (very calmly) ""I may not be popular or cool and some people may not like me now, but I feel sorry for you because you will *always* be a horrible person."" She didn't completely leave me alone after that, but it definitely caught her off guard that I confronted her and she bullied me much less.

However, what you're going through is not just bullying -  it's actually harassment, which is a crime. Your teacher could be liable if anything was to happen to you. If you don't feel comfortable saying something just yet I would speak to a guidance counselor, dean, or assistant principal as soon as possible. I know you said you don't want to, but she could be doing this to other people and you would be preventing others from going through the same experience. If you're going through what you described it truly would not hurt you to say anything to an authority figure. Have you spoken to your parents about this? They can be allies as well, depending on your relationship (obviously I don't know what your home life is like).

No matter what anyone says there is nothing wrong with protecting yourself - even if that means ""tattling"". If you were physically assaulted there would be immediate consequences. In a perfect world this kind of assault should be considered equally punishable.

But if you're still hesitant, have you tried yelling back at her in the same tone? If she yells ""You have no friends!"" yell back ""You're a terrible excuse for a human being!"" It's not the most mature route, but she doesn't sound very bright and you might be speaking her language.

I hope this helps. Like I said, women don't change. They may not scream at you when you're in a career setting, but they'll still talk behind your back, be passive aggressive - all that fun adult bullying. If you learn to stick up for yourself now you will be able to cope better in the future.

Please do not get physical, however, because you will be the one who is suspended or expelled. You don't want her to ruin your future opportunities and violence is not the answer.

elv5p2n,t3_bhjw09,"I hate it when people tells me to ignore the bully n they‚Äôll stop eventually. That‚Äôs the stupidest advice ever. Why cuz one, they still kept bullying n 2 it‚Äôll just drive u more insane if u don‚Äôt deal with it. It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúoh if your pants keep slipping down, just ignore that. It‚Äôll pull itself back up.‚Äù So my advice to u is to stand up for yourself. Only fight her if it‚Äôs necessary otherwise, u stand up to her n make sure that you‚Äôre tired of her shit. U can tell the teacher if u want but honestly they don‚Äôt do shit. Trust me, I‚Äôve been there. Don‚Äôt let your bully keep going at u cuz it‚Äôs not worth it. It won‚Äôt get any better if u just ignore your bully. N believe I tried n it drove me nuts everyday. So u stand up to her n pretty much tell her to fuck off n if she doesn‚Äôt, she deserves a blow in the face. Cuz honestly, she sounds like she‚Äôs all talk. If u did get in trouble in school, I honestly say whatever cuz u did what u have to in order to defend yourself cuz sometimes, words isn‚Äôt enough. U been dealing with this for a long time. Plus it‚Äôs a one time thing. If your parents r upset, explain to them that you‚Äôre just defending yourself n if they don‚Äôt understand that, well it isn‚Äôt your fault. But do stand up for yourself, even though it isn‚Äôt easy cuz as harsh as it sounds, really no one in school is gonna do shit. Cuz the school has 0 tolerance for violence even though it‚Äôs self defense, plus their job is to teach u school crap, not help u with your situation which is stupid as hell. Anyways I hope I helped u out. I know my advice might not be great but that‚Äôs what I have to deal with throughout my school years. Maybe they‚Äôre all some better advice but that‚Äôs what I have in mind now",t3_bhjw09

When she puts her hands to her face, punch her in the belly. Hard. Once she‚Äôs on the ground kick her in the lower back as many times as you can. Your goal is to cause as much pain as possible so she‚Äôll think twice about messing with you again. Kicking her in the kidneys is incredibly painful but leaves minimal evidence. If you have time, around the seventh kick start talking in a calm voice. Explain how blows to the lower back bruise the kidneys, causing damage that won‚Äôt manifest for years. Keep kicking to punctuate your speech. The calm tone of voice will be terrifying. Keep kicking her until she cries. Try to avoid kicking her in the face, as cuts and bruises will be obvious. Kidney punches leave minimal bruising but are extremely painful.

If you are at school and there are no witnesses, immediately go to the office and say she attacked you and you had to defend yourself.

I saw in your update and comments you tried reporting her and talking to your parents. If things don't change id still try guidance counselor and principal. Id also document the bullying and your response to it. Theres sort if an escalation checklost here: https://www.stopbullying.gov/get-help-now/index.html

Id also consider confronting her directly and asking her whats up. Maybe it wont work, but honestly its the most ""adult"" way to take things inot your own hands. ""When you do x to me, it makes me feel y."" Id try this for awhile.  If you get nowhere then:

When people say to ignore a bully, its not exactly a straight up ignoring. It can also be a neutral response so they get bored with you. There is a technique called ""gray rock"" that i think is used more with adults dealing with narcissists or other toxic personality disorders but i guess some recommend trying it for school bullies too. https://bullyvaccineproject.com/the-grey-rock-technique-for-dealing-with-psychopaths/

You could try looking at her from a position of ""maybe"" feeling sorry for her.  You already know something is wrong with her. Random bullying is not normal or healthy behavior. You might have already even been told this by adults you complain to. ""She probably has problems at home"" or something like that. They maybe give you this as a reason to ignore her/let her continue to walk all over you, or to excuse her, or minimize the impact they *think* it *should* have on you, making you feel dismismissed. 

But you don't have to use this perspective to allow more bullying. You can use it to empower yourself.

1. Apply it to gray rock method if you can. Think of it like the basis for your neutral/unentertaining response for her. She wants to get a rise out of you but youre cutting off her source of entertainment by by being ""boring."" I dont know how well this will work because she being an upfront and unsubtle aggressor. I would think it would work more for actions that seem manipulative or subtle, or for two-faced bullies.

2. Feel ""concern"" for her. Fake it if you dont really. Its like a direct-whole hearted confrontation but its more deliberately persistent and maybe intrusive, getting into her space. Now its less about your feelings and more about your concern for her.  Point out directly ""hey i notice you do this when this happens.. Do you have anything you want to tell me?""  Try to be sincere and consistent if can. Maybe she will actually open up. Give her a period of one last chance to make it right. Maybe even suggest some problems you think she might be having ""are you being bullied at home?"" If she starts to give sincere responses, and it appeals to your sympathy, you can respond in appropriately. (Id still be on guard tho but thats just me). Suggest counseling (she probably needs it anyway). No progress? Then i would..:

3. Assert a complete passive agressive high road, from a position of outright pity, condescension, and sarcasm. Again, you know something is wrong with her. The words may be the same, but itll be loaded with condescension, and you think of her as a naive child. This is you turning the tables on your bully. You are essentially bullying her back. The hope is that if you can convince yourself that she is someone who must be weak and in need of pity, you weaponize it. You've got to believe it though. Shes got money? Her parents might neglect her, and be just tossing money at her to get them out of her hair. Her parents dote on her? ""Oh im sure they love you very much"" amd give her a sad, pitying smile.  Shes pretty and wears stylish clothes and make up? Shes obviously insecure about her looks, and youre so sorry she can't come to terms with herself. Shes poor? So sorry shes having a hard time but if she works hard and tries her best you just *know* she can make something useful of herself if she really tries. Dont know why shes a bully? ""Im so sorry you seem to have some self confidence problem.. You can get help for that."" Basically realize that her every strength she tries to bully you with is a front for a weakness and weaponize it. Be consistent. But this will work best if you can convince yourself that its true. She gives you quiet ""bitch"" mouthing? Mime exagerrated crying because she needs the ego boost, poor girl. If she ever appears upset tell her ""there, there,"" ""oh no!"" or ""oh my!""  The more you talk to her like a troubled 5 year old the more annoying it will be, and the more entertaining it is. Fake, condescending pity is a pretty easy go-to, imho. *Know* that she is *less than you* because shes dependent on you to feel better about herself. At least while using this last tactic.

If you wanted to be ""faster"" at verbally engaging her, this could be a frame of mind to help you out. Maybe its worth a shot if you don't consider her to be a physical threat. I can see this as causing an escalation that could lead to a physical fight though. 

I dunno if this is helpful. I hope its not annoying or hurtful. Whatever happens dont hurt yourself. Its a temporary problem, i promise. Anyway good luck.",t3_bhjw09
elyrlu1,t1_elx5sye,"Haha. You're very considerate for telling me all this. I was a chicken to the counselor and she has been reported to the principal before on another student who is unfavorable by looks and had a need for everything to be perfect but it didn't do well. The bully's mother came and took nothing.

For the 1st point, I'm not sure if this is working or if I look scared to her. 

For the 2nd point, I feel that she wouldn't take me seriously if looked concerned for her. I have tried but she never got it or took it seriously.

The 3rd makes it look like I'm playing along, have something up my sleeve or just not scared of her anymore. 

If I have to choose why she feels the need to bully me, I think it's because she feels that I'm inferior to her. I'm not trying to gloat but I caught on in school friends good at first until I went mad of the drama she stirred up and fell to be alone. I seemed confident and chill but quiet and close to the teachers. She's smart academically but she feels the need to act ""all that"" and hate on the people she doesn't like excessively without a second chance. She perhaps thought I was smart when really I'm just stupid lucky. Or maybe she knows and hates me for that. Or maybe she thinks I'm in some way stuck up in her opinion.

I'm going to share what I know about her up at the original post if it somehow helps to explain her act.",t3_bhjw09

elyt8uv,t1_elyrlu1,"Sure it could be helpful to know more info. I kind of really doubt she thinks you're inferior to her. I think its more likely shes trying to convince herself that youre inferior to her. If she already believed it, she wouldnt bother talking to you. 

Why were you chicken to the counsellor? 

If someone else has reported her to the principal, and nothing came of it, thats not a good reason to not try. A lot times people take action when they get multiple complaints. It confirms to them who or what the problem is, if they don't know who to believe.  If you know of others who have a problem you should all go complain. Take your parents with you. 

For the first point (gray rock) its always hard to tell if its working. Even when adults try this. But you have to be consistent for a long time to get any results. Like months. Or the school year. If she sees you get emotional then itll be like you have start all over again. 

For the 2nd if you really want to find out about her and are sincere in your concern, you can expect that she will be confused and not feel safe to take it seriously, because she would be vulnerable. She would be afraid of opening up to you because she knows she has been bad. You would have to sort of have a very thick skin and willingness to be patient and forgiving. It would be the most ""mature"" way to handle it, but in some cases it might just not be worth it. But if you can get her to open up or at least let her know you are worried about her (if you really are) it could help. But yeah this wouldn't really be revenge. 

For the 3rd point, honestly i would find those reactions in her to be favorable. 
>makes it look like I'm playing along, have something up my sleeve or just not scared of her anymore.

ekimu12,t3_bbepwh,"My bully from elementary and middle school (I was homeschooled during high school because of this person) somehow landed a job right next door to mine on the same strip of stores. Legit, was scanning groceries one day, I look over at the bank that we have within the store... There she was. A part of me felt like dying right then and there. The confidence I had built literally went flying out the doors. At first, I had no clue she was working next door. I initially thought she was just in the area and decided to set up a banking account with that specific bank, but then she began to appear more frequently. She was always chatting it up with the tellers who worked at the bank, always staring holes into my skin. I figured she probably didn't recognize me, so I kept trying to ignore looking in her direction when I'd see her.

 
Then on one grateful, glorious day, she decides to go through my line. We say nothing other than ""Hello"" exchange a ""Thank you/You're welcome"" and a ""Have a nice day"". This happens 4 times total within a single month, all while she's still going to the bank, having chats, and staring. One evening I had worked, and got off bright and early in the morning. As I walked past the store next to mine, I see her sitting at the main desk in front of the store, she was wearing nice clothing, a name tag, everything, that's when it hit me. I ran home that day, I had an epic meltdown, couldn't believe the odds. 

I thought to myself ""Okay, out of EVERYWHERE in this city, she lands a job... there?"" I was so beyond perplexed, I could not believe it. This girl I'm speaking of was the primary source of every mental issue, illness, fear, problem, everything I developed later on in life.... I was suffering from flashbacks, I was so upset and fearful that she was going to plot against me or ruin what I had worked so hard for. In school, I had no friends cause of her. Any chance she got, she'd attack.

A few weeks after my discovery, she goes through my line once more. I look her directly in the face and proceed to ask ""Hey... I don't know if you remember me, but...."" she abruptly cuts me off and says with a trembling voice ""Oh my gosh, yes! I remember you, we went to school together. I've been wanting to say something, but didn't know if you remembered me either."" 

Her face was bright red, she had tears in her eyes... we had another short exchange of pleasantries, and off she went. Surprisingly, it went rather pleasant. Since then, I had lost the job, had to move, but she remained polite during every encounter after the confrontation. 

Only thing I wished for was an apology... but I gave her the benefit of the doubt anyways. She seemed more mature, didn't seem to hold a grudge, didn't seem evil, or in the need to ruin things. It was one of those interesting scenarios life places people in. Even though she pained me very deeply in the past... She appears to be a better person in the present.

Best you can do is act indifferent or like you don't care what they're saying. Because you shouldn't. those people dont pay your bills or take care of you now or in the future in any way. you do not need them.

I have been out of school now for decades. Some of the people who bullied me (not the hard-core cases but the more causal bullies) probably don't even remember what they did to me, and if they did recall it they would probably rationalize it away or not even be aware of how much their actions damaged me. But \_I\_ remember it and live with the consequences every day. They aren't the ones who hate themselves; they aren't the ones who have nightmares; they aren't the suicidal ones.  It isn't fair, but it is what it is. The point being that if anyone tells you that it wasn't a big deal or that it's time to get over it, well, eff them.

I endured bullying in my youth as well which resulted in me leaving school in 6th grade (to be home schooled which I didnt really stick with because I gave up caring as a result of the depression which was brought on from the bullying) and I have isolated myself ever since. I am 29 years old and I still struggle to this day with depression & social anxiety which started when I was a kid because of  people being jerks. One thing I hate is when someone shrugs it off or acts like I should have gotten over it because it happened a long time ago.  I have encountered a few different individuals who have acted this way when I have confided in them. 

My aunt even tells my 14 year old cousin to  ""put your big girl pants on"" when she confides in her about being bullied but yet when people are mean to my aunt on WoW, she cries about it. Which is totally okay, don't get me wrong, but when she sits there and tells my cousin to get over it or to put her big girl pants on, it makes me mad. I've tried to intervene but my aunt doesn't listen to me at all and acts like her parenting is the best ever. I'm fearful for my cousin right now because I see myself a lot in her and I don't know how to help her when my aunt won't let me. I've definitely expressed to my cousin that I'm here for her and that she can talk to me about whatever but my aunt has such a tight leash on her, I feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

Do not get angry, they love that. Do not look hurt when they exclude you. They want to know that what they are doing is hurting you. Yes, speak to them again, but do each of them separately and alone. Together they are a team and are not afraid. Individually they are scared cowards. If, after the talk they continue, do not be afraid to call them out in a calm, logical, and non-confrontational matter. They are bullies. Bully one says (for example) your work is mostly just paperwork. You say ""excuse me, did you just say my work is mostly paperwork?"". Put them in the position to have to explain themselves.

Usually I would advise to really put the pressure on teachers, but at the point of this kind of abuse your daughter faces, the only option left is to pull out and find her another school.

I know that can be difficult and extremely hard, but believe me when I say, that long-term, it's easier to find a new school now. The psychological effects of this kind of bullying are devastating, as you see already, and it will only get worse.

Then, try and find some child therapist that knows his or her way around bullying cases. You can also try and find her some out of school activity like martial arts. A lot of martial arts trainers do not accept any form of bullying in their groups. Speak to them about it.

One more thing:

"" I always let her know that it would hurt me and not to speak on things like that. ""

This is a bad reaction. I know how hard it is to hear that for you. I know my parents were in the same situation. And they told me the same thing. And all that did to me, was leave me alone with my most terrible thoughts. Don't leave your kid alone in that.",t3_a5nfzl

I know feelings towards relatives can get complex. You make lots of excuses them and their mistakes, because there is this affection for them inside you, that you can't turn off. So I maybe shouldn't say this, but given what happened to you, what they looked away from, your parents make me sick.

And this answers why you. Because you had the bad luck of being thrown into a peer-group of monsters. There is nothing wrong with you, I want you to know that. Their actions and lack of action say nothing about the quality of your person, it says everything about the quality of theirs. 

And that you could not stop this all from happening is no sign of weakness. Nobody ever cared to show you how to defend yourself, even talked to you about what is happening and why. There is no blame on you here. No sign of weakness. Not at all. 

I understand your loneliness and your desire to feel loved. Many in this sub do. Hang around.

I'm still with my parents, even though they split and I live with my mom. They always told me to defend myself but when I did the others would act like I attacked them first, and because they damaged my reputation I'd get in trouble and make my parents even more angry. They have very high expectations for me that are getting progressively harder to meet, and it doesn't help that they see my troubles as ""excuses.""

If you ever want to chat, you can DM me here. I will not ask you for your name or anything. I also can't say I'm a great conversationalist, but I've been at a similar point. And if you decline, no problem. Back to the topic at hand.

That abusers seek to destroy the victims reputation to cover up and enable their abuse is a known tactic. Happened to me, too, very early on. At least I think (my memory is a mess). The name for that is DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim / Offender.

How is your credibility at your current school, in case you want to complain, to both cops and school board?

Now, I will not tell you what to do. You choose for yourself how you want to proceed.

The whole table of girls just laughed and I just wondered what was wrong with me. That moment still makes me sad then I get angry that I didn't do something about it.

Another time we were being given tickets. These tickets were like a reward thing. If you got one the teacher would literally give you a handful of candy. One of the boys in my class came up to me, ripped the ticket straight from my hand and tore it to shreds! I remember feeling so sad i wanted to cry. He came up to my face and said ""YOU DON'T DESERVE IT!"" Not a single person did anything to stick up for me! They all just laughed at me. Looking back on it, It makes me SO ANGRY! I really wish I could've stuck up for myself in that moment.

One that REALLY haunts me is when I tried to confront the same group of girls about why they were talking about me. One of the girls said ""Oh my gosh!"" "" She's weird and nobody likes her!""

One time I was putting things in my bag at the end of science class in junior high when a kid hit me over the head with his binder.  It was towards the end of the semester so his binder was full of papers, it was heavy and it hurt a lot.  I tried to ignore it but about 2 seconds later, he did it again and laughed with a friend.  I let go of my bag and waited for him to do it again.  As soon as I felt the binder touch my head, I reached up, grabbed the binder, yanked it away from him, and threw the binder as hard as I could across the room.  Then I quickly picked up my bag and walked out of the room.  To this day I don't know who the culprit actually was, who his friend was, or who else was in the room (although I'm relatively certain the teacher was still in the room as I left).  The last thing I saw was ALL of the papers coming out of the binder as I chucked it and seeing them all raining down completely unorganized.  In that moment it looked to me like someone who shuffles a deck of cards with a bridge into thin air but it looked to me like an entire reem of paper.

e8sji37,t1_e8s9l3u,"Wow, thanks for sharing!  The bullying you experienced was much more physical than mine.  I guess the few times it got physical my wrestling took over since it's what I knew.  I can remember 2 or 3 times when I got into a tussle I didn't start and then I finished it by putting the kid on his back and pinning him.  I didn't know what to do after that so I spent over an hour one time just holding the other kid immobile on his back.  He tried to fight and escape but I made that painful to do and I was smaller but better at grappling.  He just teased me from his back, with me on top of him pinning him.  

  

I'm really sorry you had the experiences you did.  I can totally relate to wishing that you'd just kicked the bully's ass instead of letting them torment you.  When I was going through it as a kid, I used to daydream about that kind of shit all the time.",t3_9sxt38

e8u5enx,t1_e8sotgk,"Well, I didn't respond physically because I was a weak, 13year old girl and was faced with about 10-12 boys who had made it their pastime to torture me for the 3 years previously. Whenever I responded physically - I once kicked a boy hard in the balls when he stole my money out of my hand and threw it onto the train tracks - they'd go running to their mums who'd call my house and complain about me. It never worked the other way around though, whenever my mum called them, the parents would either deny that their kids would do such things or blame it on me for being an easy target.. 
so long story short, there was no way I could've responded physically without making it worse for me... it went on for 6 years in total. ",t3_9sxt38
e8st6fz,t1_e8spxt4,"I felt that I was too scared to respond and as a result did not. Internally I had a response, but I was too fearful to show it. My Mom always told me that If someone says something to you, you need to say something right back no matter how mean it may be. Though this is coming from a mom who literally had physical fights with the girls that bullied her. The problem with saying mean things back is that the person doing it can also be seen as a bully. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes saying things back will make things with the bullies worse, but I think that's when you need to tell teachers and people that can help. In this situation I lean more toward the saying things back because It's like you're speaking your mind and getting things off your chest before they set in and get worse. Though, I think that's just because I was taught that I shouldn't care what those people think. ",t3_9sxt38

e8w7fx8,t1_e8u5enx,The disconnect there is that you obviously weren‚Äôt an easy target if you responded to the bullying in a way that made them run to their parents about it. I‚Äôm really sorry you experienced that. ,t3_9sxt38
e8spm3a,t1_e8smhrx,"Exactly.  No one really helped me to deal with it.  

  

I took a LOT of bullying and teasing all the way through grade school, high school, and even into college. It took me a really long time to learn how to respond to bullying. I was small and physical violence was only an option for me a couple times. But in hindsight, I didn‚Äôt have to resort to physical violence and I didn‚Äôt have to be teased or bullied. I just didn‚Äôt have anyone teach me how to do it. Now, it‚Äôs always uncalled for. It should always be squashed and corrected and we should teach our children not to bully and to stand up to bullying. But that said, I‚Äôve taught my sons how to respond to teasing and verbal bullying. And we practice it all the time. I point it out to them when I see it anywhere and help them to learn. You can agree or disagree with my perceptions or my methods, but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve taught them in a nutshell:  

  

First, realize that verbal bullying and teasing are just shit tests. It‚Äôs just someone giving you shit to rattle your cage. Knowing that makes it a lot easier to respond. So before you let someone hurt your feelings, call it what it is... it‚Äôs just a test. Then, here are your options for responding to the shit test (different shit tests and different personalities call for or favor different responses):  

  

**1) Ignore it**. But REALLY ignore it. For this to work you can‚Äôt pretend it doesn‚Äôt bother you. It has to REALLY not even register with you. You can‚Äôt blush. You can‚Äôt make a face or clench your fists. You can‚Äôt stutter. Just really ignore it. If you can‚Äôt do that, use one of the other options.

**2) Agree and amplify.** It doesn‚Äôt matter how negative the comment is. You can always take what they said, and blow it out of proportion to the point of absurdity and hilariousness. And that‚Äôs your goal. *Example:* a radio commercial came on talking to ‚Äúall the women‚Äù about how unhappy they were with their current bra. A kid asked one of my sons if he was unhappy with HIS bras. My son could have gotten his feelings hurt. He could have said ‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm a BOY! I do NOT wear a bra!‚Äù But instead, he smiled wryly and said ‚Äúdude! Shut up! I‚Äôm trying to listen! I‚Äôve GOT to find a better bra. Mine are all so uncomfortable. Quick, write that phone number down for me.‚Äù Everyone laughed and the situation was diffused. He agreed and made it funny. *Example 2:* I was actually the culprit in this instance. I kidded to one of my sons that he was SOO skinny. He responded: ‚ÄúYep, I'm like a churro with legs.‚Äù How does anyone respond to that? You laugh, hug the kid, and tell him THAT was a good one.

**3) Pressure flip.** This one does require a bit of wit. So as a parent, I intentionally practice with my sons. The goal here is not to deny what the bully has said to you, but instead to take it and flip it to put the pressure back on the bully. *Example:* One of my sons is named Bobby. Another kid at school called him ""Booby."" His response was to loudly whisper ‚ÄúHow did YOU know I have boobs? Were you staring? (While mockingly covering his nipples over his T-shirt).‚Äù Ok, this one has some agree and amplify to it too, but you can see the implication and pressure he put right back on the bully in response to the teasing.  

  

Now that‚Äôs the verbal and mental side of bullying. On the physical side, I roughhouse with, and I teach and practice MMA with them. Really, any martial art. But knowing how to handle yourself physically is key.  

  

And on that front, they know that I‚Äôll be upset if they can‚Äôt look me in the eye and tell me that they didn‚Äôt pick the fight. But if they are being physically hurt or even threatened, or if they see someone else being physically hurt, I‚Äôll back them up 100% for going on the offensive. They don‚Äôt need to be scared of being suspended from school or for any other reason if that‚Äôs the case (yes, this one comes from my own experiences growing up. I intentionally went to the fetal position when I saw a principal coming after I‚Äôd responded physically when I finally had enough of the physical abuse from another kid.  I was scared shitless of what my parents would do to me if I got suspended for fighting.).  

  

I can‚Äôt eradicate bullying and teasing. But I can prepare my sons and give them tools to respond to and pass shit tests from the bullies when it‚Äôs directed at them. And then the next part is teaching them how to take a stand for others when they see someone else being bullied or teased. But that‚Äôs a post for another day.",t3_9sxt38
e8weg48,t1_e8w7fx8,"I was an easy target because it was easy to make me cry, that was their game. When it got harder to make me cry, they got more physical. When I responded physically myself (hardly ever) I guess they were just surprised. And that one occasion, he didn't expect me to kick him in the  nuts :P

In the future if things were to worsen or you needed to prove a claim, doing this could help you out.

Does your workplace have security cameras? If so, and you need to communicate with your workers, try to do so in view of the cameras. So they cannot make false allegations against you. 

If you need to communicate online, try to do so with email and write professionally. This way there is a paper trail of communications all in one place. Have a good password on this email and your computer so it does not get hacked.

This may sounds stupid but whatever, I only 36 so take it for what it is. I have not seen mention of any hobbies from you, I hope you do have them, if not go train in combat. Like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, from my year doing so, I can say that no one will bully you and if they do the owner/top black belt will likely ban them from training after painfully subduing them. I have trained with so many great people from all backgrounds for all sorts of reasons. I have met people who came to learn to fight bullying, law enforcement, people with autism and all sort of disabilities, even a guy with 1 hand who is absolutely amazing at BJJ. IT is the most welcoming thing I have ever done, builds confidence, health and friendships. Combat bonds people and BJJ is as close as a civilian can get.

I was bullied a lot the beginning of this year (mostly physical),I'm going to be a sophomore, so I decided to lift weights and start wrestling. It all stopped. It's wrong for people to get bullied but in the real world the victim should make an effort to not be a victim if you get what I'm saying. I don't know what else there is to say.",t3_8v01jo
e1kckoi,t1_e1jpxia,"The thing is, I don't think you should change *for* other people. 

I know having been so alone and quiet throughout my life, I made some awkward blunders socially in college as I was trying to learn the ropes of making friends. Nothing that warrants bullying. I don't really bite my tongue when I think a friend is being insensitive or rude and I think that bothers people. 

That's a voice, a change, that I made in college because otherwise you will be a doormat your whole life. I've toned it down, but in the beginning if someone I asked to hang out a week prior suddenly told me the day of that they found better people to hang out with because they forgot about me, I'd just straight up tell them that that was rude and they weren't being a very good friend. Being told things like that *upsets* people because it injures their ego. I've found often in situations with very rude and manipulative people, if you call them out, they will suddenly make *you* out to be the bully. It's projection and a way of diverting accountability. 

The group of people who bully me in college are a particularly ""popular"" group of alternative music kids who think really highly of themselves, I've since met other people who also think they're assholes because of their hive mind. 

Those aren't really people that I feel like I want to change for. 

Sophomore in high school? So you're like 15-16? Don't let people tell you how to change so that you fit better into their idea of normal. If you enjoy wrestling, that's fine. But letting other people control your worth/image/personality is setting yourself up for more issues as you suddenly need approval from other people to feel good in your own skin. That's not a good place to be, that's where I am right now. It's not a healthy thought process, but I want to be liked because I'm not a bad person.",t3_8v01jo

e0gq1fe,t3_8ps2e6,"I respect bullies like I respect a forest fire. If I try to burn it into submission I'm the worst kind of fool, the kind that endangers others. Like a forest fire, the best strategy is to recognize the conditions necessary for one to occur and plan for contingencies. For example, equip the first responders properly and be ready to call for help if those plans are inadequate. 

I like this analogy so I'm running with it. =P 

Most forest fires are started by human actions. There is a lesson there for bullies too. We create the conditions in our organizations that let them thrive. We don't set interpersonal boundaries properly or give people access to resources to prevent bullying. Some bullies can be helped by directing them to counselling. Some need to be let go before they can damage the organization. Often victims need additional support. 

Similar to forest fires, negligence is often a contributing factor. Someone will carelessly flick a cigarette butt or perhaps hire someone without properly assessing their character. Or in the school system it's often playing ignorant. Perhaps that parent should have moved their child to a different school system even though it was inconvenient. Perhaps that teacher should have called social services on the abusive parent. Who's to say? All I know is that if you leave a smoldering cigarette butt on dry grass then a fire is likely to follow.

I have been bullied since I was 4. I'm 18 now and although sometimes people still treat me like crap I have a better outlook on life at the moment.
So many teachers and teaching assistants and even fellow students over the years brushed off my complaints. Apparently good students can't be cruel. ""He's a teachers pet he wouldn't hurt anyone."" ""You're too sensitive"" etc.

I have also bullied people before and i'm really not proud. I hate myself for it. I can never forgive myself for it. But ""hurt people, hurt people.""

2. They don't care. They've done it so long that they don't care anymore. They've seen and heard it all and your problem barely registers anymore. 
3. They're bad teachers and they don't know the line of discipline. Some teachers don't have kids, don't like kids and don't really know anything about disciplining children when these things happen. 
4. They see the potential in that bully and not you. In most places, the bully is somebody important looking, someone with a sports background who can stand to be 'somebody' someday that will raise the school's profile. They're less likely to punish a student who could become successful and protect you, a victim who is likely to give up and fail. Yes, it makes them a fucking awful teacher.

I'm not a bully, I get bullied a lot, one time I fought back by slapping them with a book and my teacher canned me so hard the cane broke, it's unfair, Unfair, UNFAIR(sorry got me raged there).

Unfortunatelly the school system does not help to bullied children, so defending yourself, even escalating the fights can be a good way out. Maybe not always, but definitevely sometimes for sure.

I'm a parent of a 2.5yr old who plays with extreme social harmony with his friends. But this also has a downside because if another kid shows force on him, he doesn't fight back. Some kids can be more invasive than others. At this age, I understand that the kids are not consciously bullying, but my blood boils when parents of invasive kids take pride in feeling that their kid is going to be a future bully. ",t3_5j7mah

d9idtb1,t3_5al94e,"As a former bullying victim myself, I can assure you that nine times out of ten, the faculty will screw you over just as bad if not worse than the bully. The zero tolerance thing only exists so the school can protect itself from sue-happy parents, with no regard for the well-being of the students or common sense. The vast majority (key word is majority) of teachers will take ineffective action at best out of fear of the consequences (hence all the stories of both the bully and the victim being punished). This leads to students not trusting faculty and as such, bullies basically get free reign.

My best advice from my own experience is to find the one faculty member that doesn't have their head up their own anus and get them on your side. At least then, you will have someone keeping an eye out for you. If things go south and you get suspended for ""involvement in a fight""(this will happen if things get physical, even if you don't fight back.), call the school out on their crap. As a side note, that principal should be fired. It's one thing to be incompetent, it's a whole new level of idiocy to outright say that being bullied is the victim's fault.",t3_5al94e

You should really tell your parents about this, because that principal was totally out of line & had NO right whatsoever to say such a disgusting thing (as it also makes HER a bully). If it had been me in the situation, my mum would've come into that school like a hurricane & she wouldn't stop venting until the principal was sacked (& if they did nothing about it, she'd threaten to go to the local newspapers; & she honestly would do it)! LOL. Anyway, on a more serious note ... if this horrible principal had said these words to a chronically-depressed teenager & they later committed suicide; she could possibly get jail time for that! So there is NO WAY that she has the right to say such cruel words to ANY students! It's excruciatingly obvious that she is not right for this job & she should indeed be sacked (or at least given a position that doesn't involve interaction with students). Please tell your parents exactly what she said, because they need to hear you say it before they can take any kind of action (& fingers crossed something will be done). All the best, friend.

c7vx0bz,t1_c7vwmng,"I went through a similar situation in High School. Check my post history for a long summary I posted in another thread a couple hours ago if you're interested.

As an outsider looking into something that is familiar to me, my advice would be not to retaliate, but to shut them out. Their immature actions are NOT your problem to decipher. Nor should their hurtful attitude be your concern. Letting them go makes it easier to go out with your mind set on forging new, real connections with better people than them. I know that's very much easier said than done. But they don't have the *balls* to talk to you before they ostracize you, and that makes them not your friends, and not worth your time and attention.

Bear in mind the bully is getting something out of bullying.  Just leave.  When you find their next victim, share stories.  Realize you're important regardless of what the bully says.  Bullies lie.  Don't play their game.
",t3_15puk3
c7slvnx,t3_15puk3,"I dont think so. I call it a lesson in empathy.

The way I see it, thre are three ways to deal with a bully. First, bully back as both a line of defence and a way to expose said person's insecurities with their selves. Second, use humor or laugh it off. Third, kill them with so much kindness it 1, makes them too uncomfortable ir 2 makes everyone think that person is an asshole to be so mean to such a nice person.",t3_15puk3

c8641dn,t3_15puk3,"I'm a 6'4"" guy so I don't have to worry about being bullied. However, I think I can give you a few tips on what makes me think I shouldn't mess with you even if you're smaller than me.

1) Be crazy. I mean really crazy. You know those weird thoughts you get from time to time about how you could kill everyone in the room? Let that take over while you're talking to me.  
2) Make threats you can keep. Sure, if we got into a fight I'd probably ""win"" but not before you destroy my nuts, rip out one of my eyes or bite my jugular. See above.  
3) Challenge the challenge. Yell ""what the fuck are you gonna do? huh?"" fucking scream it. You're fucking terrified? Good. Use that. That means you're desperate and might do something crazy. Again, see above.

The point is that most bullies are pussies. When they imagine fighting you they're thinking it's going to be some kind of gentlemen's match where you exchange fists in a sporting manner. The quicker you make it clear that, no, this is a no-holds-barred fight to the death kind of deal your typical club douche bags will back off.

Of course keep in mind if you're dealing with someone who's legitimately crazy then run. Fucking run. Don't worry about being called a pussy. Admit it. ""Yeah I don't feel like getting stabbed by that psycho. I'm such a pansy.""",t3_15puk3
c860486,t3_15puk3,"Smirk and walk away. If they come towards you, verbally slowly threaten them with the most evil glare possible, ""Stay AWAY from me.""

In my childhood I have fought back and even beaten a kid up.  No good came of that.  I did not like what it did to me because it started to change me.  What's happening is that the bully attitude is replicated in the victim.  So now the victim will tend to bully other people.  That's why I say you can't fight bullying by fighting back.  There are better ways.",t3_15puk3

But I did learn something from all those years of hell. Acceptance of oneself and acceptance of your peers are entirely different and I know you can‚Äôt just accept yourself suddenly but you shouldn‚Äôt let the opinions of people who know nothing about you dissuade you because at the end of the day you spend like what 16-18 years in school before you never have to legally socialise with those bum heads again and you can just forget they existed and by the time you leave school they will be long forgotten.

And who says your not good enough for anyone, that‚Äôs a load of rubbish because I guarantee there is at least one person in your life who cares about you. Even just a little bit i mean you get along with the people you smoke with (they aren‚Äôt the right crowd to be around though so that‚Äôs a bad example and you should get some help with your addiction but I‚Äôm guessing they at least give a damn about you so that proves my point).

And even if everybody in your life doesn‚Äôt care about you there are 7-8 billion people on this Earth and statistically speaking you‚Äôre bound to get along with at least one person. You even have people on the internet taking notice of you and giving you advice and support so that shows that you‚Äôre good enough for somebody to like you so there you have it you are good enough for other people you just have a few issues to work out.

So try and kick your addiction, talk to a therapist about your suicidal thoughts and go out and find some friends who share your interests and work on your self esteem a little and you‚Äôll be set for the future (a support group that you go to for therapy would be a great place to start since they would be in a similar position to you).

You are not defined by how others treat you, and you're allowed to feel angry over how awful they were to you. There is no shame in knowing you didn't deserve to be hurt like that.",t3_gf0s7t
frb79ok,t3_gf0s7t,"I went through this exact thing when I switched schools after I moved.  My advice is deal with it now and don't let it fester.  It's good that you acknowledge it's a problem because I didn't. I thought it was normal mood swings and such due to puberty since I was always a moody kid, especially since entering my teens.  I kept expecting it all to sort itself out but It never did and now I have the monumental task of dealing with it all in my late 20's.   Talk to a counsellor, do research on how to deal with your symptoms (ie intrusive thoughts and anger/mood swings), get fun hobbies and such to distract yourself with, look after your health, build new skills and accomplishments to build your self esteem and maintain a group of friends and acquaintances who make you happy.  Those are all things I WISH I'd done when I was in school but never thought of, never thought were necessary/ useful or just never did.",t3_gf0s7t

Usually its number two, and really what it amounts to is manipulation.  The person really likes acting out like a jerk and just takes advantage of the abuse cycle by being friendly.

I like to think we are friends, since we make a good team at work when he's being serious, we send each other stupid memes nearly everyday, and he has offered me rides home after work which I declined politely - which is why I am confused as to how he feels towards me. 

Thanks for the advice, I do try to focus on work but he is just a bit too charming unfortunately lol and manages to get me chattering away all through my shift.

Communication is a very helpful habit for anyone.  Next time when he does it, just pull him aside and say, ""Hay, you crossed a line there, can you please not do that."" in a calm manner.

f5netsz,t3_do6kcf,"I agree with your title: it never goes away.

I‚Äôm still haunted by the demons (bullies) from 30+ years ago.

One of them is a 3rd grade teacher. I‚Äôve attempted to make contact with him on several occasions. Both through his work email and Facebook. He has never replied, but I know for a fact that he has knowledge of someone who was attempting to reach him. I posted something on the school‚Äôs Facebook page. They deleted it, and blocked me from commenting/posting. I told him that I hoped he and the school system he works for would try to take legal action against me.

I found another bully who used to physically assault me in the boys locker room. He showed up in my ‚ÄúPeople You May Know‚Äù feed on my Facebook account. I messaged him, confronting him about what he did to me and how it has affected me even still to this day. I had a mutual friend contact him to make sure he knew I was trying to get a hold of him. Again, no response.

In a drunken stupor a couple of weeks ago, I searched his profile and discovered he had a few public posts. I began a series of rants that attacked his moral character in an attempt to expose him for the monster he is/was.

I woke up the next morning to find all my comments were deleted (big surprise, right?) and I noticed he blocked me just a bit later. (He even had his wife block me.)

I‚Äôm with you. You start an anti (kick ‚Äòem to the curb) bully task force; you let me know. Karma is like luck: you have to make your own.

Best regards and good luck!",t3_do6kcf
f5oss28,t1_f5netsz,"Thank you! I do hope some day to create a precedent at the very least- schools love to really talk about being no tolerance and stuff but they really don't care. It's a game to bullies and just an annoyance to a lot of staff/faculty. Kids don't give a damn about detention or suspension. It's not humiliating. They're not being paddled in front of the whole school to take them down a couple notches anymore. Maybe that's the first step in actively ending bullying? Like a Palmolive soap, tough on smug bully grease and soft (but still effective) on the innocent hands. Not my best analogy. 

I definitely agree that karma has to be made, because while I do believe in it I believe in it being enacted by actual people, so we have to have involvement in that system. It does feel better to know you get where I'm coming from and have experienced similar stuff- not to say that I am glad you went through it, just that I am grateful for the understanding.

I was severely bullied at your age (over 30 years ago) but there wasn‚Äôt any Internet or social media back then. I know bullying is so much worse today than when it was back it my day with the advent of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc. Bullies who are too afraid to bully you in person can now hide behind their laptops and iPhones from the comfort of their homes.

I read one of the comments regarding taking screenshots of the messages and sending them to the very people 10, 20, 30 years from now.  That‚Äôs a great idea! I wish I had irrefutable recorded proof that I could present to the ones who bullied me.

I have been recently attempting to make contact with the ones who bullied me.

There is one in particular who used to physically assault me in the boys locker room. I found him on Facebook and messaged him. When he failed to reply, I viewed his profile and saw he had a few public posts. I went on a long rant about what he did to me. I woke up the next morning and discovered he deleted all of my comments. When I went to view his profile later on that day, I discovered he blocked me. I tried to view his wife‚Äôs profile. He had her block me, too.

There‚Äôs another who is now a 3rd grade teacher. I‚Äôve been emailing him and messaging him on Facebook for almost 2 years. Still, no response.

Practically anything you do to get even could backfire on you. If you were to organize a school-wide harassing of his premature baldness or divorcd parents, the school would probably wind up punishing you for bullying him.

Unless you can arrange for him to insult someone who is likely to flip out and attack him, you might have to play up the things he says and make him uncomfortable. If he calls you gay, begin to enthusiastically and loudly describe the sex acts he must want to have with you in order to bring up the idea. Make him regret picking you.

1.Talk with the faculty if you haven't already.

2.Try to speak to him and point out what he's doing. Some kids just don't register that what they are doing can cause real harm, they know it's mean, but they think it's all in good fun, pointing it out could be viable.

3.Try and convince him to laid back. Maybe he's mean on purpose, but deep down he's not that much of an asshole, you could convince him to dial it down at least a notch. He will keep being an asshole, but hopefully just with his friends, or through the occasional out of place commentary.

4. Confront him about the divorce, and get him to accept that what he's doing isn't acceptable, but don't rubb him in his face or he will simply lash out. Try and be empathetic even though you really think it's not justified. He might see he was doing wrong and be more mindful of his actions.

These are alternative solutions that might not work, but they also are options that avoid doing more damage. They require more effort than simply punching him in the face (which I don't deny could be another solution) or bullying him back about his divorced parents, but doing the right thing rarely is the easiest option.",t3_daaadr

I mean, they insult you, your style, demean you in front of others. That they use the pretense of humor doesn't change that.

I would tell them to stop, that you think this isn't funny anymore, and that this is making you uncomfortable. Will they listen to that? Likely not. But it takes away the pretense that this is friendly, when they do not stop.

But when they continue, you then can walk straight to HR or whoever is in charge for stuff like that. Because you tried to resolve this among colleagues, and that didn't take. And the moment they failed to respect your wish, they became openly hostile. It is not your job to defuse a hostile workplace, you already got a job, and I am sure your company thinks too, that you should do that job on company time, not waste time trying to stop people from messing with you.

And if they continue, you do it again. And again, and again. Word of advice, if HR can't make this stop, get the initiative and start looking for a better workplace. And maybe look into what legal options you have, if you would want to go that route.

They won't stop by themselves, and it will only get worse, with bullies it usually does.

The bully felt really ashamed and it was the first time he even realized he was doing such a damage. Since then everything changed and it gave me so much more confidence for the future. 

My advice: prepare the way how you want to articulate it to them and then initiate the situation where you can call them aside to tell them whats on your heart. Just be honest and straight and you have nothing to lose.

Bully: ""Did you leave home at 12 AM so you could get to work on time?""

Me: ""What does it matter what time I left home? What matters is that I got here on time.""

If they laugh or something or tell me something else, I'll just answer something like, ""Oh wait, this was supposed to be a joke? I simply didn't get the joke.""

If they say anything at all while I'm sat at lunch with the usual people I have lunch with, I'll completely ignore them, even if they ask me something directly. I won't even look into their faces.

Even if you try it with politeness just don't leave for occasional situation. This is something which needs to be rooted out and the only way how to really gain their respect is to confront them directly on that matter.

I will tell you how I did that - it was the day after we where on a team event and the guy was behaving really disrespectful there. Next day I was at home office but my decision to confront that situation just became definitive so I did not wait till I will be next time in the office and called the guy via phone straight away.

I told him this: ""Hi \*\*\*\*, I just wanted to ask you because to be honest I really feel like you have some problem with me and since we are colleagues who meet on daily basis it is not something that feels good. That's why I wanted to ask you if you can somehow articulate what it is about me which you don't like or basically what is the reason of your behavior or whether there is a reason at all?"" (btw I think you could use this, it's super effective :))

He instantly sighed in a way like being super ashamed and started to say things like he is sorry and he really pushed it to faar the day before and actually he thinks he doesn't really have a problem with me it's just some bad chemistry between us as he sees it. but he respects that I let him know and he will be behaving towards me like he should and even admited that the behavior is not ok.

He instantly apologized in his reply, saying he's sorry if he hurt me in any way, as though he knew what I wanted to talk about. The next day we spoke, and he felt really sorry and was actually sad I viewed his behavior this way. He claimed that he was ""joking"" with me because he really likes me as a person and thought of me as a friend (I forced myself to block most of this as I know it's just sorry excuses). He promised to stop nonetheless and to let his friend know that they're bothering me and that he should also stop. And the behavior did stop!

So I guess thanks are due. :)

My manager also knew and said he will under no circumstances tolerate this behavior and would deal with it appropriately the moment I ask him to. I ended up asking him to give it a chance and see if the bullying stops, and if not I'll let him know so we can proceed. Thankfully though, it did stop. I hope it doesn't happen again, but if it does, then now I at least know I've got a few options (knowing I have my manager's support).

f088g6t,t3_d3k4xg,"It's not that you are weak or that you play victim. It is more complex than that. What is happening is this. Now that you have incentivized what others have done to you initially now you notice it clearly when it happens again from new people. It is very prevalent. That is people acting that way is more common than we are led to believe. And you are right others do detect that you are aware of thier acting out. It is like be gifted. You can see through people and they fear you which just causes more bullying and them trying to intimidate you to run away. People don't want to see who they really are. Alice Miller wrote a book called the gifted child and it is about this. A person seeing through their parents ill founded opinions and acting out towards the ones next to them their children. And a child can see through this. I used the word plastic growing up but others call it superficial. But it is parents not dealing with thier past and projecting this on their children. Never to be confronted or they will intimidate the child to back off. There are a lot of quotes about bad parents from famous writers. Such as Doris Lessing. But we see this bullying too elsewhere with our friends co workers and schools. And it is the same cup of tea. A person who has problems acts out and belittles another so they feel better. They will get others to take thier side and they will enable the bully because they want to feel part of the group. To be popular. And also to avoid being bullied themselves. Since we don't get proper behavior and it does not get resolved with proper communication it leaves us with a sense that relationships won't work. So we try to protect ourselves. We even take slow motion steps in common tasks just so we can plan avoidance of problems. We also become so hurt that we want to set an example of how we want to be treated. We get excited when we see a good person. And when this good person lets us down well trust is stolen in every ,over we make outside that relationship. So we are looking for getting a man on base. And we just want to play and have the thought a good relationship can happen. The more it does not the more we feel isolated and punished. Because all those people are making their wrong doing seam like it is the vicious fault so we do feel guilty and we do feel worthless because of that twisting of words. Which is why a person experiencing bullying is desperate to untwist the words of the others and try to desperately find another to side with them. They see the enabling and want thier own people to side with the honest truth. Leo Tolstoy said the most beautiful thing is truth. All of this is actually making you a strong person and not weak. You are articulating human behavior and this is valuable information for everything we do. And this sense of brilliance and strength is what others notice and are afraid you. You do realize most the Dr Seuss books talk about these topics. Even go into depth about cause and effect of our actions. It is about standing up for yourself and others having courage to stand up with you. But you feel weak maybe because you. An not fight the problem. And the advice is have others help stand up with you. Pick comrades and not friends. The difference is a friend does it for what he can get out of this relationship. He is silent so he gets things from that situation. Where as a comrade does the right thing even if he looses benefits. Narcissism. Is just like bullying because it uses a lot of the same things. They have no remorse. They twist things around. They get others to enable. They intimidate you of you confront thier lies. They don't take no for an answer. They blame you for the very thing they did. It takes a to to untwist all this and that is their intention. To not get caught. To make it difficult for you to confront them. So it helps to discover over all what is happening here and there. And you are wright about how this affects a persons stability and thier whole existence. Just as when people stand up to wrong it intimidates the wrong doer which forces them to be a good person in the community. And their whole life is affected with a proper confrontation. The bully with out knowing all of this is doing just that but in reverse. It is significant in both directions. Sorry about this happening but you need to pull it together and use what you have learned and feel your strength so you can help put pressure on those people or new people so problems like those you mentioned are harder to get away with. What happened to you is terrible but it puts you in a situation where you now have answers to help others so they don't have to go through what you did. It also gives us purpose. People doing what ever they want to another is a common thing today and it needs to be terminated. Take care. Hope this helped.",t3_d3k4xg

ey32tt1,t3_cu2l9r,"Thanks for your story and sharing it.:)

Mine is kind of like yours but a little different.  I saw my cyber bullies in person. Daily.  They were the personal trainers, sales people, front desk personnel at my gym.  It's actually a fitness franchise.

It all started out with one personal trainer, who, for the life of him, did not like being ignored - in person.  I'm an introvert, and just wanted to work out, speak to whomever i chose to, make gains. (And yeah, i'm a girl)..

Gym members and employees would act out in groups, anyway they wished. But if i retaliated in any subtle way - they were offended.

Members who've also been harassed there, exposed them on the internet, just as i have.  But those same members always ran after placing their reviews. (Or probably were targeted and bullied).

I decided to stick around and see if there would be any improvement, after i placed mine.

Long story short, it seems it went from individual harassment, to a group,  to group facility, to meetings, conferences on the administrative levels probably up to the CEO. I literally saw them in a conference for damage control.  I wouldn't have known it until i saw the front desk manager, who looked dead at me, then ducked down behind the nearby desk when i walked past the admin. folks meeting right there in the lobby.

It was interesting to research and observe over a year of harassment and bullying tactics, that gym lost personnel, clients, friends, etc., just to get at *one* individual.  A person that the majority of these folks didn't know.  But were happy to take their frustrations/insecurities out on anyway.

*They just went along with it because it was fun - that was it.*

Whelp.. one day, i stood up to that one personal trainer, who instigated all that mess. Finally looking him in the face and calling him on crap, was interesting.

I felt sorry for him.  That smug grin was wiped off his face, and i saw him for what he was.  He was just a kid - (even though he looked like he was in his early 40s).  And not very intelligent, with his mouth swung open.  But what really amazed me, was this *kid* could influence a large group of  supposedly adults, (gym members/personal trainers) to the point they believed him, and without question - gleefully, acted out in groups.  People aged from mid 30's to late early 70's, from the looks of them. Some of them supposedly ""role models"" for *their* kids.

The *online* silliness started with their sales personnel, who's job is to also suppress anything on the internet to keep their company looking squeaky clean.  The moment i posted a little of my experience here on Reddit, there she was, like tRump on Twitter..  From that moment on, there was an online harassment campaign to shut me down, telling the mods here on Reddit that i was a shill.  Right now, her, the clients, relatives, co-workers and the watch dogs for that corporation are still working furiously on Tumblr, flooding my feed with some interesting memes. :)

Just looking that kid in the eye, was enough for to realize it wasn't worth my time, going there.  It worked i my favor, somehow.  I did get a chance to finally come out of my shell as an introvert. And met some really cool people with whom i'll stay in contact with.

But i will say, the whole experience was truly eye opening, and i am so thankful for this lesson.  I was able to observe firsthand - the lengths, people will go to keep their jobs, protect their egos/insecurities, and how far corporations will go to cover their as\*\*.

All because of some kid..",t3_cu2l9r

I‚Äôve encountered my fair share of similar instances but I still continue to play, because the people I meet and actually make friends with, mean more to me than some silly guild or some person calling me an idiot during a dungeon run. 

I used to play OW (FPS) but after I got tired of the constant toxicity and seemingly inability to climb, I quit playing Overwatch cause it‚Äôs just so toxic. 

I returned to WoW and have loved being back. I found a new guild immediately (one of the top in the realm apparently) and they are great. 

Basically what I‚Äôm saying, is that you will meet all kinds of people online. Some will choose to bully you, some will support you, and others will ignore you or betray you. It‚Äôs up to you to look into the positives of why you originally joined the game (not the guild) and hopefully you can find that sense of love again.

That's a very good explanation there. Another thing I've noticed in bullying situations is that status is an often overlooked factor. Many people grossly underestimate how much it influences whether a bully will face consequences or not for his bullying behavior alone. An average student bullies, he's a bully and is sanctioned. A less popular student bullies, he's a bully and is sanctioned. But if a popular student bullies, he's just ""hardcore"".

Yeah, perhaps that was my fault. Not to worry, my skin's gotten thicker these recent years. This happened years ago, to clarify.

But the thing is, teasing or not, when Jacob saw how upset I was getting, he should've apologized. Instead he kept it up, suggesting he actually enjoyed making me miserable.

Sure, he wasn't bullying at first. He was just being a dick and I overreacted and I apologized to the guild after that. But the problem is that's where it should've stopped. One day Jacob just came out of nowhere and started harassing me to oblivion, yet all the other guild members were *still* downplaying it as teasing, and how could you expect me not to have lost my shit after that. Everyone has limits and here you are thinking I'm some angel who's completely pure of any feelings of anger.

But for a lot of people that simply isn't true. Most bullies are probably either psychopathic or sadistic or are in denial--in other words, they were/are glad they hurt you, and they are glad they are still hurting you, or they will never admit they hurt you, or they will blame you for what happened.

It is possible that this wouldn't be true of your bully, but I don't think it's likely, and it just may reopen the wounds. The hell of it is that, especially at that age, being bullied is like being raped--they take something from you than can never be given back, they do something to you that can never be undone, and to this day some of them are probably glad they did it. Trying to have a dialogue with your bully probably won't change any of that. Maybe I'm wrong and there could be some sort of closure, but I myself wouldn't try.

Even if the end came to me the same way someday... at least I'd die knowing that I broke free from the role imposed on me, and I got to express my feelings through action, at least once in my life. No ego stroking which could be fake, but having the real brutally honest thing.

It all depends on the context and im sure your situation is unique. But ""standing up to a bully"" is sometimes bullying itself. young people might not understand the difference.

And it isn't a surprise when people will also ""stand up **for** that bully"" when they see you taking an action out of revenge. 

&#x200B;

If it isn't physical revenge then its just a case of understanding and influence. They don't see if from your point of view.  Understanding what you are standing up for is important. And understanding your opposition is just as important to understanding that conflict.

‚ÄãI partially agree with you on this. I can definitely see how in some cases, especially with younger children who are not as socially developed, miscommunication and misunderstanding of the others intentions can lead to an escalation of a situation. 

That being said, I think this factors much less into bullying that occurs in older individuals and adults. I think your completely neglecting how people at times can feel strongly entitled to things that are not theirs and are willing to engage in unethical behavior to attain those things. How would you deal with a coworker who desired (and felt jealous) of your position and sought to undermine you at every opportunity? This is a very real and common scenario that doesn't stem from a ""breakdown of communication"".  Somehow I doubt you would follow or find success in your own philosophy if you were to find yourself in a similar situation. 

>Your reply here is horrible. . .

>When successfully retaliating you need to exert tact . . .
This is terrible advice. This continues a cycle. This creates a bully.

This world. This reality. You say cycle, I disagree. I think inaction and naivety is what largely perpetuates the cycle of bullying. Many aggressors will back off when they realize their actions have consequences. What you are describing is a perfect fantasy world and at best, greatly oversimplifies the causes of bullying. If better communication is all we need, why do we have police forces and armies who use force or rely on the threat of force to enforce our laws and interests?

Do you think your words of idealism are victimless? There are serious consequences for being a victim, for being dominated. It's not a coincidence many bullying victims go on to suffer mental health consequences later in life. And sadly some of those went on to have the worst possible outcome of taking their own life. Some of them were pressured into taking the higher road by cowardly adults who used their words of zero tolerance and improved communication to mask their own unwillingness and fear of confronting the real root causes. In my eyes, those people have blood on their hands. Giving people permission to defend themselves empowers them and protects them from greater harm down the line. I don't want to see another generation misled by those who haven't experienced the nuances of bullying who advocate for unrealistic, ineffective strategies and ignore base human nature.

>If you actively practice what you are preaching - My comments serve not to blame a victim, but to stop a bully. You become what you hate because you want to play that game. You don't have to stoop to that level. Be better to yourself and others.

I really, really question if you've ever been on the receiving end of actual bullying against someone who saw you as an obstacle to their goal. Your views severely neglect to take into consideration how far some people are willing to go in the name of self interest.",t3_bs7olc
eph1tlc,t1_epfcfsw,"I wouldn't say i ignore the people that are solely self interested, I just advocate for a ""higher ground"" and in my experience ""getting back"" at someone is just too petty or too much work from my point of view. I just be blunt and move on. I use to be very spiteful myself and really it was just a waste of time. Why should a bully or anyone really occupy my time? life is too short. I guess i just chose to move on from a lot of that drama. 

&#x200B;

At the end of that road where you talk about revenge and getting back at people IMO you just find an unhealthy obsession with the idea of justice. Sometimes it really isn't worth it. 

> I think inaction and naivety is what largely perpetuates the cycle of bullying. Many aggressors will back off when they realize their actions have consequences.

If better communication is all we need, why do we have police forces and armies who use force or rely on the threat of force to enforce our laws and interests? 

I don't think what I'm advocating for is teaching people how to be passive, naive, or not take action. I think you misrepresent my intentions with that reply. In the same vein of having a police force and an army we also have a justice system. What I'm advocating for is understanding and communication right?  Don't we need to understand laws and interests before we seek to enforce them? I want to empower people to be active and informed on those laws and when boundaries are reached. 

>Some of them were pressured into taking the higher road by cowardly adults who used their words of zero tolerance and improved communication to mask their own unwillingness and fear of confronting the real root causes.

I don't want to see another generation misled by those who haven't experienced the nuances of bullying who advocate for unrealistic, ineffective strategies and ignore base human nature.

So you are saying that the root cause is solved by violence or at least the threat of it. Could you also say that violence is usually a last resort?

Like, if there was a flowchart of how to handle conflict in most any environment - violence would be at the bottom. so, If you just teach violence then you are missing the majority of tools that one could use to de-escalate or solve a conflict. 

&#x200B;

When you use words like ""pressured"", ""ignore base human nature"" and ""giving permission."" I think what you are really advocating for is a sense of **self agency**. Physical nature is the first and most ""base"" way we express **self agency.** bullies can rob you of that and maybe its natural to want to try to rebuild your confidence a simple answer like violence. 

But beyond that we use words. I don't think using words is cowardly - i think the opposite. I think using words is very brave in the face of violence. Violence is unfair. I just need to have a bigger gun than you to win.  Words are easier. 

&#x200B;

What I think many educators and authorities for young people are terrible at is enabling young people to use words effectively, to communicate effectively. Just like a athlete needs a coach a communicator needs a moderator. 

So in that respect I can see how you might see advocates for non-violence as quixotic and idiotic.  

&#x200B;

You are constantly on about defending people against the self interests of others. Is it so hard to believe that some people want to help too? Selflessly? (like writing long reddit posts haha) Its healthy to be suspicious of new people but it also can be very isolating.",t3_bs7olc
ephdgde,t1_eph1tlc,"I think you misunderstand what I mean by retaliation. Retaliation from my point does not necessarily mean violence or a petty act.

Only as self defense or a last resort. 

I also don't have an obsession with justice. Again you misunderstand me. I am for self preservation.

edk1zqd,t1_edjsb6f,"We are looking into the possibilities of moving and buying some land right now, further away from all this. I was bullied too. I grew up in a border town, where my sister and I were the only white kids there and it was pure hell in the schools. I did not have any memorable school days.  I don‚Äôt want that for my child. Unfortunately, we do-not live in a world where we can all get along or come together in peace. It‚Äôs very sad",t3_adktya
ee4q4oy,t1_ee0ywws,"Sure. Often times the victims of bullying simply aren‚Äôt being taught how to perceive and respond to verbal bullying. My parents never taught me how to deal with it. They just didn‚Äôt know.  But just like we teach our kids to tie their shoes and brush their teeth, I think we also need to teach them how to be resilient and to respond to bullying.  
  
So, shit test 101 (I call them crap tests with my 9 and 12 year olds):  
  
People will do this to you consistently throughout life. They give you shit to see how you‚Äôll handle it. It‚Äôs an innate quality that you probably have too, whether you notice it or not. At the kids age it comes in the form of name calling and poking, etc. If you respond by getting embarrassed, hurt, or turning red and slinking off, you can‚Äôt handle them. And then, because they got that superiority rise out of you, they continue to do it until you are able to make it clear that you can handle them. How does your kid do that? There are 3 ways to respond to a shit test:  
  
1) Ignore it  
2) Agree and amplify  
3) Pressure flip  
  
Talk to your kid about teasing. Help them realize that it‚Äôs just a crap test so that every name they get called and every insult feels like a game or challenge instead of a mean and hurtful personal attack. Then practice with them. Challenge them to spot the crap tests on the TV show they‚Äôre watching with you (by third grade there‚Äôs def name calling in their TV shows). Point it out whenever you see it in conversation. Point it out when a sibling calls them a name or does something mean and ask them how they‚Äôre going to respond. Remind them of their three options and ask how they‚Äôd like to respond.  Congratulate them when they come up with something particularly good, and help them figure it out when they can‚Äôt come up with something. If there‚Äôs a name in particular that they‚Äôre getting teased with, call them that and show a lot of love and good humor as you explain that it‚Äôs a crap test and ask them how they‚Äôll respond.  
  
Ok, so on to examples and explanations. To 1) ignore it means to really, actually, ignore it. You can‚Äôt flinch, turn even a little pink, grimace, or look away. It has to really not matter to you. When someone makes bunny ears behind you, you really just don‚Äôt care. When somebody calls you a variation of your name, you just don‚Äôt notice. If they ever get a rise out of you at all, this one is lost, move to the other two. It‚Äôs also IME very difficult for little kids to really pull off. 

2) agree and amplify. The goal here is to show that you don‚Äôt take yourself too seriously and to do so by saying something that takes what they‚Äôre saying to a funny extreme. Example, someone in school called my son Bobby, ‚ÄúBooby‚Äù. Bobby didn‚Äôt miss a beat. He mock covered his nipples over his shirt and loudly whispered ‚ÄúHow did you know I have boobs?‚Äù  Everyone laughed and the situation is no longer one where he‚Äôs being teased. 
  
3) Pressure flip. Exactly like it sounds. You turn it around on them. So someone calls you a pimple butt and you ask why they were looking at your butt.  Someone calls you a poo face and you respond by laughing and saying that you were thinking they looked like a puke so if we walk around together we‚Äôd be the walking pees.  
  
It takes practice. Some kids are better at it than others, but everyone can learn it. You need to be the one to explain it and practice with him. All the time if he‚Äôs struggling. PM me if you‚Äôve got other questions. ",t3_adktya

eddkzmd,t3_ad4p6o,"Not that I heard off.

The thing about movements like MeToo is that they are backed by very powerful interest groups, in the case of MeToo that would be Feminism and groups on the left side of the political spectrum (this isn't meant as derogatory, just matter of fact), and those groups have a ton of followers in Hollywood already. That means that not just the victims of the events that led to MeToo support the movement, but also people who were never victimized.

So a comparable movement against Bullying won't look like MeToo and I wager it will need time to grow.

One problem is, that there is no interest groups that is dedicated against bullying in the public sphere. That is largely because bullying tactics are widely used by both sides of the political spectrum to demean, silence, defame and attack opposition. Watch The Young Turks back to back with LourderWithCrowder and you will see both using abusive tactics against their opposition. The implications of Anti-Bullying reach society wide and go against the established ways of doing things.

That works against finding supporters that were not victims themself.

The other problem is that bullying victims often have smaller social circles and more negative life outcomes, meaning our ability of spreading the message is compromised, but thanks to the internet and social media, not by much.

Lastly, there is a narrative, especially among the political right, that bullying is a character-building experience, which is of course complete fucking dogshit. But it is a narrative that we must counter and a lot of people who have been through bullying spout that narrative. ""Bullying helped me toughen up"", we all know this kind of guy.

So based on that, what I think we should do to start a movement against bullying:

Organize affected people. Social Media Groups, websites, forums dedicated to helping bullying victims and to organize bullying awareness. I have no fucking idea how to organize such a thing.

Target groups susceptible to our message. Who has an interest in stopping bullying? The 2 largest groups here are Parents and Employers. Parents because they surely dont want their kids to be victimized in school and then ignored by our wonderful teachers, employers because workplace bullying causes significant economic damages. How to do that? I don't know. Suggestions welcome.

Lastly, playing with dirty tactics, based on the political division we see nowadays I think it could be a worthwhile approach to frame anti-bullying messages in a way that suits the political narratives of each side, to get the word bullying, and with that the research and context of it, into the public eye. That would work by calling out the opposing political group for using bullying tactics (Trump said ""X"" that is bullying, exclusion of conservative students in course ""Y"" is bullying, the whole shabang. The correctness of the talking points is less relevant than getting the message out. A bit like subliminal advertising). That would either require funding for a troll farm, or an organized group of people to do that in mass and nearly full time to generate viral content.

Just knowing that you can defend yourself is important. This is why non-lethal hand combat self defense classes are so important.

e9nmuyd,t3_9wvj4w,"To me this raises a big issue with bullying that sometimes an individual is not ready for the group. I can't comment on this specific case, but it could be for example someone who might well be bright and knowledgeable and well-educated, but doesn't fit in with the business culture and does not know the details of their particular work environment. To the individual, they can feel unfairly treated, but to the group he or she is somewhat of a nuisance. If the bullying is ostracisation (being left out) then the group might be aware that it's wrong to be actively nasty, but nonetheless they resent him or her for making their lives harder.

They can be a nuisance especially if they at enthusiastic, approaching things in a new and energetic way without understanding the practical and/or human reasons for things being as they are. This is a typical situation for a new graduate coming in to an established existing workplace, or any new staff member really. 

I'm not saying that this is the reason for all bullying, just sometimes. The viewpoint of the group is one where they feel both sympathy for, and annoyance at, the newbie. 

You can apply this theory to society at large where millennials get angry with baby boomers for hoarding and hogging the resources of society, while the baby boomers (the generation born after the war), presumably feel a patient despair that the millennials can't comprehend all the issues at stake. Young people get angry and feel misunderstood and victimised, it's part of life, and the older people try to explain to the young what's what but they forget that when they were young they didn't listen either.

ea0ywoo,t3_9wvj4w,"I'm not sure this is bullying. Some people just have not the right chemistry to get along.

e9o5tcp,t1_e9nzgbl,"I think that the appropriate advice would depend on the situation. It could be that she needs to calm down a bit, stop going at a hundred miles an hour trying to change things, and take a while to fit in socially and professionally. It could be that she's not ready for or not suited for the role. It could be something completely different. Overall she can't control other people, only influence them, but she has the right to leave the job and she can talk to coworkers, family, friends, and other people, although some people she talks to might be duplicitous. A problem I personally have with talking to people in a workplace environment is that I can't take in what's being said to me sometimes. That's probably a sign that I'm out of my depth, perhaps, or perhaps not. But if I don't listen, or if I listen but don't understand, then that's not my coworkers' fault exactly. I'm not saying that workplace bullying isn't a bad thing, in the NHS for example there are issues with transparency and secrecy that are made worse by bullying, but if you're trying to get on in an organisation then that's kind of at odds with whistleblowing, I guess you've got to pick your battles, but I can say that no job will provide complete happiness and no job is perfect and there will always be jerks. I mean, it's one thing to look at a job that someone else has and think ""that's where I want to be"", but that ignores what that person has been through to get there and continues to go through, and when these things are spoken or written on paper they just come across as clich√©s: ""start at the bottom and work your way up"", ""be a go-getter"", and of course clich√©s aren't always appropriate but sometimes they are.

So for that, you're just cool to start with. :) Secondly, this sounds like what is called ""heckling"" and I know that all stand up comedians deal with it. The successful ones learn techniques and find their own way of coping with it. It might be hlepful to google dealing with hecklers or talking with local comedians to see how they deal with it.

It is the employer's job to make sure that you feel safe at your workplace. If you are seriously considering quitting, perhaps it would serve you best to talk to your employer, at least to establish a record that you feel uncomfortable there. A workplace should not be hostile. Workplace bullies, whether colleagues or customers, they exist because of who they are and with the support of other enablers. It is absolutely NOT your fault. I recently wrote an article about workplace bullying (http://www.vuongnguyen.com/tech-friends-lets-get-rid-of-workplace-bullies/), and unfortunately the statistics just doesn't look good for bullying targets: 82% of victims loses job due to quitting, termination or mutual departure. With this being the case, you can either establish record of a hostile work environment, sue the employer or you look for a different place of employment. The reasons bullies survive because it is simply less trouble for bullied victims to just look for another gig. I'm sorry I don't have a solution, all I can say is that I sympathize with you and hope that you find a place you'll be happy working in. Take care and please reach out to other people, to me.

fozwwae,t3_gackpx,"Yeah Reddit can be incredibly harsh, in my opinion the most openly harsh social platform (I feel like on fb people are a little more fake in regards to giving thier real opinion). Some people unfortunately just like to hide behind a screen to bully others. Try to not let it get to you. It's harder to do than to say. It makes me really sad as well especially when you post something you're proud of or you are just asking a question and its met with intense criticism. I am a yoga teacher and I've posted pictures only to get annihilated with alot of meanness. If anything think of it as a way to make you stronger because in the real world the bullying can be even harsher in some respect. I like Reddit a lot but there are always individuals who use it only as a way to troll others. It can definitely make someone really really sad and I've been really upset over some of the comments I've received but then you got to remember there are good people out there that are kind and non-judgmental.

I'm sure a lot of people dont always take the time to read the rules and it's a simple mistake, theres no need to be mean about it but just keep being you and learn from it and remember that some people like that just want a reason to be mean and then there's people that take that as an opportunity to be kind.

I was bullied a lot by a girl that was abused by her brother, she used to be my best friend and then dropped me one day and started harassing me to the point of damn near suicide. A lot of bullies are jealous of something you have that they don't, whether that's money, a stable family, actually friends. Bullies almost never have friends, their ""friends"" are people who are just trying to stay close so they don't have a chance of being their next victim. If you ever take a closer look at a bullies friend circle, they are scared of them the minute shit hits the fan those ""friends"" will be relieved to drop them. I can talk from experience I had to stay friends with one of my bully's for almost a year, I fucking hated her. We knew eachother for 2 years, the first year she was my best friend but then she got really mean, she liked to put down other girls to make herself feel better and started doing it to me. With her she was jealous of girls who had healthy relationships with people and men, pretty girls, people with a stable home life, and nice people in general. She targeted really insecure girls and would just make them feel like the lowest of the low. When I noticed her doing it I would tell her to stop but then she would just turn on me, out of fear of her spreading private things I told her as a friend I faked being her friend for the last year of highschool just so she wouldn't bully me. Everyday I despised seeing her, it would literally suck the life out of me trying to have a conversation with her. Everyone around me could tell I absolutely fucking hated her, and the day I graduated was the day I dropped her and never looked back. Bullies don't have friends, they are just trying to not end up in your shoes.",t3_era093

Best thing is once you know why people bully it can be for many reasons it makes it easy to not take it all too personally 

I have a manager at work she‚Äôs not my boss and I found her practically bullying others even me a few times! I‚Äôve always found she‚Äôs either jealous of that person which is why she picks on them... 

I sing for a hobby and I‚Äôm damn good at it, it what people tell me... and when she saw a video of me singing karaoke on a staff night out she commented on it and then after that she started making work life difficult for me but I can always talk to my boss about it or just stand up to her now and then...",t3_era093
ff6kzgy,t3_era093,"Well we all tend to bully when it's convenient.
It gets people to do things the way you want and ""its OK because....."" insert excuses.

Maybe it is ""helping"", maybe that person just doesn't know another way to get an important point across.

We think if we ask why some how the answer will solve the problem.

The real answer is they think they can.",t3_era093

I haven't met enough people who do this to get a full grasp but those I have met had so far two things in common.  First, they have massive egos for some reason and second there not that bright.  

I think that people like this will allow themselves to get agitated over small things because this gives them a reason to act out towards others.  I have a roommate who would get pissed off just because of how I cut the potatoes and would shit on me for it.  I knew a guy in the army that got pissed because I dry shaved at the time.  It doesn't really take much.  Sad thing is that from what I have found due to the unusual nature of this kind of bullying its hard to get people to take is seriously.

f9pk5fb,t3_e6b3l3,"Have u tried telling your parents? 
If they dont help u, take matters to your own hands and stand up for yourself. Do you feel like your life is in threat? cuz if you do, it is domestic abuse not merely sibling rivalry or bullying. Try telling an adult whom you trust and will take action. 
If I were u I'd just punch her in the face. Also just a reminder...you r not a fat s**t or whatever your bitch of a sis is calling u. Your beautiful and you matter. Dont ever let anyone tell u otherwise. <3",t3_e6b3l3
f9q2mi1,t3_e6b3l3,"Something my father once told me is how the family isn't just the people you live with, family represents the people who care the most.  I find a lot on reddit from places like r/JUSTNOFAMILY or r/family how people put up with an unusual amount of abuse from family members that they wouldn't put up with otherwise.  

The reality is that you are in no way obligated to tolerate such abuse.  Even from family members.  I can bet your sister gets a real power trip from treating you like this so until that changes she will never stop.  Take it from someone who knows though that the longer this goes on the worse it will get even getting to the point where she won't even recognize what she is doing.  This could hurt not only you in the future but potential spouses and children as the behavior bleeds onto them.  

You need to stop the behavior.  I looked at your comments and think that in a way you are enabling your sister by refusing to do what needs to be done.  Some times people need a good swift kick in the pants when other means refuse to work.  So you shouldn't be afraid of hurting someone who prioritized doing harm to you.  If you have reached out to your parents without any help or others with the same then it comes down to you vs her.  If it keeps going one day its a possibility you will end up going NC, which is a very common result from cases that sound similar to yours.

They can react to it however they want. They can laugh at you, dismiss you, deny it, want to call you names, be bitchy, whatever. It doesnt matter. 
If they want to be friends, they will show you. If they don't, they will show you. Maybe, you guys can have a talk about it. Maybe theres bad information, or peer pressure involved, or a misunderstanding. You decide what you want to tolerate. 

Whatever happens, don't stress. There's always other people. The main person to worry about is yourself though, and your own future. 

Good luck!",t3_detzym

f2txjw1,t3_de8ltc,"it's a big big world with very different people out there with very different goals and different lifestyles. School is just society's training session to become a good slave...getting young humans ready to spend the majority of their waking lives in servitude to a company or government or organization... there is no escaping it.

My point is that you, me, and all the other students in schools are just slaves... it's pointless for slaves to fight other slaves... let it go. dont assign any more value to his opinion than there is. It's just HIS opinion that reflects on HIS character and his experiences (or lack thereof) in life. it does not affect you or pertain to you in any way. it is his, and his alone to own. Most people will observe this too.

Best way to live life is to observe other humans without passing judgment, and to let them be who they are, as ridiculous as they may be, and be who you are. Your daily words and actions speak for themselves.

Ultimately, everything is passing and interchanging except the real stuff, which is the stuff of the soul, like beauty, love, harmony, symmetry, even understanding and logic. You're already half way there little bro, since you're a musician and book lover! Getting familiar with universal ideas through novels and such.. and experiencing the higher deminsions of art definitely gives you an advantage in life's journey as a whole. I would suggest that you read more on subjects that broaden your entire perception of life and people and why they are different and act the way they do? This way you'll be humbled, calmer, more confident, and appreciate difference.. even the bad kind! Because at your age school consumes most of your time and your life is basically centered on it, it feels big and overwhelming than it actually is. Don't forget also to account for the fact that you're still (I assume) experiencing significant chemical changes, which should certainly affect your mentality as a result. Peace

I suggest you take some time off social media - be it a week or two or a month.

I was literally the favoured person in the group and then all of a sudden i fell from ""grace"" as so to say and i view all their instagram and fbs trying to find what wronge with me what iv done how i can fix it. But i want you to know that woman and her instagram doesnt define you and any great moment never had photos invloved. Honestly. All the great things in life were to fun to be wipping out the camera. Id say the bullying was stemmed from jealousy. Wheatger it be you stole her lime light. Or a boy she liked looked at you. Or if you had the hair she wanted just anything.

And yes, this ""friend"" is obviously a fake friend, he always claims that he's just joking, as an excuse. This week (before blocking this b*tch), I changed my profile picture of me playing a bass guitar but he commented some insults, by sharing a ""shitty-guitared"" version of an old song, and putting a caption of ""this is how <my name> plays guitar"", thus triggering a panic attack for me and that's where I proceeded into blocking this small fry.

f1ehvdi,t1_f1e99lu,"Oh man! She was most likely jealous of something, which made her feel threathened. I have experience with this, but in a completely different department, family. It really shouldn't havd been the way it was with my sister, who was second oldest put of the three of us,  but it was. She actually started making up bad things about me and telling my oldest sister who turned against me, this was around the time I got on honor roll at my online hs. My sister on the other hand was a complete slacker and would project the negative ways she felt onto me. For example, if she felt ugly, she would say I was ugly, if she felt fat (she was waaay heavier than me and I lost weight. I was 133lbs) she called me fat, when she felt stupid. (When I got on honor roll) she started to make me look that way and her and my oldest sister would say it so that I could hear it beind my back.

Jealousy is a really awful and useless thing, it's especially pointless when you bully someone over it. I actually think you might be right about the hair. She had bangs, i had grown mine out and I often curled my hair, my hair was also very long. She actually outgrew her bangs the very next year and I remember, one day when the bullying was happening, she tried to make me jealous of her hair because It was curled (the way I usually do mine) and she sat directly at the desk in front of me, looking back at me to see if she would get a reaction. It was curled funny üòÅüòÇ

Then another time, i had my hair all done up, curled and parted down the middle. She just kept making fun of me by saying that I looked like a 70's girl. Honestly that's a compliment, those girls had more class than we do today! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I was a heavy girl, but everyone in family always told me I was pretty. Looking back at my photos at the time I couldn't agree more, I was just heavy. (Don't get me wrong, I love the way I look now, it's just I gained some pounds back and I'm working to lose it.) She and her friends would often poke me in the stomach, say I was fat and try to bribe me with food. They basically talked down to me because they thought or tried to make me think I was fat and retarded. Well on another day in art class, one of the most popular girls who was in a different grade and in their group, had said that I should wear a ""little shirt"" that said the word ""retard"" across the front of it. They laughed loud, so that I could hear it and know that they were talking about me. That one made me REALLY depressed. I remember feeling like I wanted to hide my face, run out of that art class and CRY! My bullies never called me ugly though, her especially, they just made fun of me by comparing me to different things. It was MY SISTERS that  called me ugly. Idk why they hated me so much. üòû

Anyway, thanks for your reply and especially reading that long, depresding post, you made me feel better about the whole instagram thing and now, i realize almost exzactly what she had been jealous of.

She actually goes to a really big university and is taking a program on acting and directing. Of course that made me pretty jealous because I'm an artistic,creative person, but who knows, she might not even make a career out of it or she may become the biggest star to ever exist. I wanted to do voice acting at one point. 

She actually graduated thespian of the year at my former high school. I went to the middle school and elementary school over there and most of my childhood friends, she had made friends with. Though, she was an actress at a theater since she was 5 anyway. Me on the other hand, I was a writer. I still am üòâ and really smart.

If he's triggering something with you (the panic attacks) then, yes you did the right thing by blocking him. There is absolutely, no point in respecting him if he has no respect for you.

It's not your typical shower thought though. I've thought about it and I don't think theres a way to anonymous either. I could change my name, but the letter I wanted to write would've been titled dear former bully. Or something like that.
In It, I was hoping to stay anonymous, but this would seriously backfire because it might sound cryptic being anonymous. She could think I'm some sort of person with malicious intent and get the popo to investigate it. There's an awful lot of risk in this. She could also, post my letter on her instagram and mock it. Knowing that, I know her instagram and have seen all her posts, she might talk sh#t about me because she knows I see it and that could make things worse for me mentally. So, so far, I'm out. Thank you for the suggestion though.

I think I will, write a letter to her, but not send it to her. That way I can provess these emotions on my own. I can upload it to a writing share site, where people may be able to read it and I may be able to help them too because they can relate to it. Kind of like an art form.

"" I want you to know, that you don't need to beat yourself up for not sticking up for yourself then. You were a child and we all tend to back off when people do hurtful things to us when we're kids.""

Yeah, our minds are so tied to what they think about us, especially when standing up for ourselves. It can be really scary! Though, the bullying does make you stronger. I'm very close with my mother, we're like best friends and she tells me stories of how she actually used to get bullied and she was too afraid to say anything. She was 15! Her little sister who was 11, would stick up for her big time and against 16-18 year olds bullies! This was in the 80s and you know when you hear that number people were so much tougher. She was hispanic and dark and would often get called racially offensive names by other kids. Was pretty terrible, but it made her stronger and times were different then anyway. She even told me (and she has her mother and sister to back her up on this) (They saw it first hand) That she got into psyuchal fights withngirls who would say things, likd ""oh she thinks she's so gorgeous!"" ""Oh she thinks she's all that"" ""she's a sl#t because all the guys like her!"" Well one day, a caucasian girl, and her group of friends started a huge fight almost everyone in that area knew about it. I know, times are different and all, but the way she told the story was HILARIOUSüòÇ. I wish you could've heard it because I forgot about it, but she would often get into physical fights and had no other choice, but to stand up for herself because you know, it was the 80's, people were tougher and that's just how things were then.

I on the other hand am not nearly as tough as my mother was and that's okay. 
It's not like we can just beat our bullies up whenever we feel like it because times have changed. You'd probably (people in general) go to jail or juvy, i think it's spelled.üòï

Also, no one should ever put a hand on another person because it's wrong, but I just shared some life experiences to you that my mother shared with me. They're not very good lessons, but I hpguess one thing, U've learned from her is, to always stand up for yourself and be tough, but not so tough that, you yourself are bullying another.

Thank you so much, you comforted me and I feel mych better! üòä I'd be happy to have you as a friend and if you need to talk to me, feel free to! üòÑ",t3_d8xc4p

f1h9cca,t1_f1h3b82,"Yeah thanks! Inktober is awesome! I've actually never really tried it before. Most of my pens suck. Come to think of it, I've never really used pens. I often use pencils and that's it because I'm still a little new. I've been doing art for 4 years and my drawing skills have improved drastically, but not as much as I would have liked them to. (I'm self taught) I'm 20 and don't share my art because I'm still not that good and I just barely started learning or taking it seriously at least, when I was 16!üòïI've had a few classes on it before though.

I just kind of live by that idea that it's never too late to learn new things, especially things you want to learn!üòä It just makes me think of all the old people at age 60, learning to play the pianoüòä

The reason I didn't improve was because I focused on drawing what I wanted to draw and drew doodles of little cartoon characters instead of focusing on practicing techniques. I just have a rough time dollowing those techniques because their not done the same way as mine. I can draw a decent cartoon face, get the proportions right (sometimes) and have a complete sketch. I just barely incorporated colored pencils and I'm still learning, shading and blending and what goes where, but inktober is pretty cool!

I used to want to draw and paint like Eric Lacombe. Google him and you'll see awesome acryllic paintings paintings that look like, stylized, yet almost lifelike depictions of decaying things and sometimes monsters. I love Stephen Gammels artworks from the old books, Scary stories to tell in the dark as well. He's another person I want to draw inspiration from in the future.

So basically, I focused way too much on face, makes for a great cartoon character, but now I want to start to learn realism, drawing houses, forests and different items as well as locations. I also love to write characters, currently I have ideas for 5, but I can never get what I see in my head onto the page and that's a bummer, but the better I get, the more accurate it will look. 

So, i I guess It's back to the basics of drawi g realism for me!üòâ

f1kkl0j,t1_f1khqdn,"I feel the same way about my bully. You're most likey right. They fake their happiness most of the time and sometimes I feel bad for them. (Not saying it in a mean way I mean genuinely)  It reminds me of kpop idols, those people I feel bad for because even though they have all this fame, they are often worked almost to death. Also, they're in the eye of the public, so it makes things extra stressful for them. Yeah, i get what you're saying.

As for bullies in general, they may have feelings of insecurity, a bad home life or even been picked on themselves. So that's why I have that empathy for them sometimes. 

At the same time, yes  our bullies make us stronger people, without them, we probably wouldn't be one step closer to being that person we always wanted to be today. We wouldn't have learned all those painful lessons and who knows, we would've been just like them. We would've believed it was okay to be mean, believed it was okay to make others feel scared or even hurt them (physically and psychologically) and that's no way to be!

Since you seem to like macabre art maybe you would also like HR Giger, Francis Bacon (the guy who did the ""screaming pope"" stuff not the other Francis Bacons), or Hieronymus Bosch. They are all old dead guys though so maybe you already knew about them.

I think in art, theres some general rule that you may as well get to showing your art because it gets you valuable responses, and helps you to get thicker skinned. But i know how you feel I also don't like to show my art.. Inktober is the only time I do it because really its for all skill levels, and if i make something I'd otherwise be embarrassed to show i just say to myself ""fuckit its just for inktober.""

This is 100 percent true. Maybe I should go to r/ drawing or something. (Sorry don't know what it's called) and post some artwork there. I could even ask for advice on how to improve.

I never really heard of them, but It would be great to find some new artists that I can draw inspiration from! I used to love dark things so much! I had a passion for them, not to level where it was satanic, but it just fascinated me. I was into abandoned places, concept art for monsters, ghosts and creepy things in general. I loved writing horror stories and had so many ideas. One of the character's that I wrote was from the 80's era. She could sense things beyond human perception (she was basically a psychic, she had elements of the tough lady stereotype, but also she was italian)  and saw some pretty creepy stuff in the story I was going to continue on. I kind of stopped being into this stuff because I got at lighter place in my life and wanted to write about beautiful scenery, but when October comes around, you know I will bring all of that stuff right out again!

Dude, Same! When I even put a pen to paper and try to make it look decent, It ends up looking bad. ;(

I need to force myself to use pen as a medium, that way, I can learn to draw fast and without the guidelines. I draw with guidelines A LOT. I still haven't gotten out of that phase yet, but I should someday If I work hard enough.

I believe that sometimes they change and grow as people. Sometimes it can come back to them and they can realize how actually wrong it was, what they did to others.

The truth is, they themselves are insecure. I found this out because i had a sister who started talking crap about me with my other sister and often she would project her negative traits and her mistakes onto me, to make it look like I was the one who was, stupid, fat or worthless. Turns out, she herself, felt all those ways because I had actually lost weight and got on the honor roll at the time she was doing them. 

They may have even bullied that kid with autism because, they want to fit in with the crowd. They felt that if everyone else was doing it, they had to do it too, to be cool. 

They know better than to bully someone with a disability, but might choose to because they can hide or cover up their insecurities with someone who is seemingly ""weaker"" than them. They also know that they can get away with it because that person is unable to do anything which is terrible üòü",t3_d8xc4p

etreegg,t3_cd1rls,"Alright. First of all, to get rid of the bullying, losing the weight won't do much. They bully you because you are their target, not because you have weaknesses. Everyone has weaknesses. Likely, if you take a look at your bullies, many of them are butt-fucking ugly or mentally deficient. 

You are being bullied, because they are horrible fucking humans, not because of you. 

When you mentally and physically can't cope with it anymore, it's time to leave that school. At least temporary. So first of all, get sick leave. Either go to your doctor and describe how you are feeling (self-hate, shame, body-image issues and throw suicidality into the mix. Likely, you feel like that anyways, I know I did.), or go to the school councellor and tell him. Either way, you are not going back there for now! This is absolutely vital, because staying there will destroy you more. 

Then it'll be time to get competent therapy, think about changing schools, and to start up martial arts. Something like boxing will teach you confidence, self defense and its physically exhausting as fuck, so you will lose weight!

Lastly: Do you eat voluntarily, or compulsively? If voluntarily, that's good, if you find yourself eating to feel better, or because you absolutely have to, despite not being hungry, then eating might have become a coping mechanism for you, that is something for therapy. I have the same thing. If the latter is the case, take your time for the weight loss, disordered eating takes time to heal.",t3_cd1rls

etrwy16,t1_etrsukk,"Likely, because at the time it started, he displayed characteristics that abusers look for. Low self esteem, socially isolated, anxious, slow to act defensively (be that self defense or trust in authorities).

When someone is out looking to victimize someone, he will look for certain traits that suit his agenda.

This is also why I put distinction there between the victims personality, and traits it has. The victims personality has little to do with it getting picked as a victim, but the traits it displays has, and you can learn those without needing to abandon who or what you are, if you are comfortable being that.

Be more aware, walk with good posture, know the purpose of your actions (because that gives confidence that shines even through anxiety. The guy asking a girl out despite having cold sweats has the confidence of conviction. And that shines.), have good boundaries and enforce them, be ready for defensive action. This will keep much more dangerous predators off you than mere bullies.

As for personality, bullies first seek to harm, then they choose what to attack. You are not bullied for being fat, for having a big nose, a stutter or whatever. That is just picked as a reason for the abuse after the victim was already chosen.",t3_cd1rls

eu6wx9s,t1_eth9nat,"I agree! Well one thing I recommend is not goving them attitude back or sassing them. My neice and nephew are closer in age to me than the typical neice(nephew)/aunt relationship so we were all pretty immature. I was not used to having kids around a lot being almost an only child raised strictly and they were kind of being spoiled by their mom. My neice and I would have fights all the time. The key is to be calm and collected and not react to them when they are pitching an attitude towards you specifically. Do not feed into it. Another thing is when you notice some attitude with other kids you sit them down and show them in your own way how that could be hurtful to another person. Dont bully them and do what they were doing back to them exactly, but in a way that they understand try to connect your point to something they understand already. One thing i do sometimes is repeat what they said back to them and asked how that made them feel when I said that. The ""I feel"" statements and asking why they do things can sometimes be enlightening as well. Sometimes there is underlying frustration and fear that can be fueling the lashing out.

 I recently had to explain to my neice that you cant blatantly say that her brother's drawing and handwriting was ""horrible"" because everyone is working at their own pace and he is two years younger than her. I told her to write what he wrote and I pointed out what she could have done differently and explained that nobody is perfect and that people will improve and you have to let them do that. It worked out and she started complimenting his work more. I only wish i would have mentioned that she could give him suggestions on how to improve but to be honest she can be a bit controlling when it comes to others doing things properly.

However, not gonna lie I can be a bit of a hot head and get super angry when kids are being greedy, controlling or entitled but this is what i wish i could do every time a problem arises. And when i do use it it works!

esfhtkv,t3_c79f0u,"Hi there!

this situation is obviously a tricky one. From what I've read, it seems that he is getting something out of terrorizing you. So far, from what I understand, he has 'only' been playing mind games with you. 
There is an old saying: ""A dog that barks does not bite"". This is not to say that the situation is not serious. It is. However, it seems more to me that he is trying to make you afraid. Seems to me, he has achieved in his goal. Now this is also very understandable.
But what I would suggest you do, is that you monitor your reaction (body language, voice tonality etc) whenever you come across this situation in the future. You do NOT want to come across as scared, even if you are. 
This may potentially be the prime motivation of your bully. By using all of these mind tricks on you and by repeating the same threat he makes it seem more real. Basically he is gaining power over you by threatening you. Clearly, from what you are describing, he seems to have sociopathic tendencies.

As to whether you should go to the police is a tricky question. I must disagree with some of the other comments that have been posted here. Simply giving your word is not evidence of a crime. As far as I am aware, almost anywhere in the world, a spoken threat to a person's physical health is an act of crime. However, without any solid evidence to prove your point you may not win. This doesn't mean that you can't go to the police. Ultimately, this is your call. 
If he does actually get violent and hurts you, do NOT hesitate: get help and contact law enforcement.
Is there anyone else (not on Reddit) that you are comfortable sharing this with? Parents? Brother? Sister? Friend? Girl/Boyfriend?

Another skill that comes handy is being quick-witted with your tongue. What I mean by this is basically that you can deflect situations using humor. This does obviously not work so well with physical abuse, however it can be very effective with verbal/mental abuse.
For example, my reaction to his comment (""His response was that he will stab me, take my wallet, and donate the money to the poor."") may have been something along the lines of: 
Well lucky me, turns out I'm poor as well, so you might just as well want to give my four 4 dollars back to me anyway.

Keep in mind, if you are looking to involve other's into this situation that they may see the situation from another point of view.
He may also (purposely) only act this aggressively towards you. Towards other's (usually in some position of power) like for example a school worker, teacher or the principal he may even be friendly.

Once again, try being aware how other's perceive you when you are in that situation. Fear to a bully is what blood is to a shark. They feed off of it.
Hope this helps! Glad to answer more questions!

That being said, if your paying for these classes, and it's not for anything serious for a career, it's pretty unjustified for them to be getting upset with you and for your teacher to be a dick to you.

If it's not for anything serious, and someone says something, or you make a mistake, next time maybe just laugh it off while apologizing and saying your a slow learner. Something like ""Sorry guys I'm just a little slow at this"" or ""Sorry guys, still learning"". Might help some of them to empathize with you and give you more chances. 

If the teacher is still being a dick to you perhaps consider finding a different dance class. If your up to it you can stay behind after class and talk to your teacher in private. You can say something like ""I really don't appreciate the comments your making about me, and I think that is really unprofessional conduct on your part"". If the teacher is still a dick to you, leave and maybe complain to your teacher's higher up's that this teacher acts unprofessional and you will no longer be a customer to this business for that reason.

On a personal level for the future, maybe you can think about the reasons why you may be a slow learner and see if there's anything you can do to improve your cognition.",t3_bvzzls

I went from popular (elementary school) to being a loser and bullied (started 5th grade, by my own Fifth Grade Teacher), then bullied into 7th grade, had enough, went 'degenerate' in 8-9th grade, got popular, went back to an old friend, that tried to take me back to ""loser status"" since he was from that same elementary school, to popular with drama again after 10-12th grade...

&#x200B;

Then promptly left, and never returned or spoke to any of the people from that town again for the most part. It kind of haunts me, but I just use it as a 'teaching notion' to remind me of how people can be towards you.

enlsv7b,t3_bos0l5,"Think of it this way...

Your bullies are made of the same stuff you are. In the end, they don't have anything more than what you have - flesh, blood, bones, muscle. That's all.",t3_bos0l5
enm3o9k,t3_bos0l5,"I honestly don't know what would have worked for me. I think a lot of it depends on who you're dealing with, because different bullies can react in different ways. Here are some ideas and thoughts--you may have to try several to see what works on whom.

First, even if you don't feel confident inside, you have to give the outer impression that you're confident. Act calm and decisive, with a relaxed, halfway amused or halfway bored expression on your face. Do this all the time, every day, not just when the bullying starts.

If someone is nearby and says something to you, you can stare them straight in the eye--hold their gaze--and step a little towards them. Then, after a pause of a couple of seconds, ask in a low, very serious voice, ""What is your problem?"" and/or ""Are you looking for trouble?"" And do NOT look away.

Another approach, very different,. is when someone says something to you, just look at them like they have two heads and laugh like this is the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened to you. You can laugh AT them, ridiculing them, or another approach would be to laugh at yourself and say ""Good one! You think I don't know that, Captain Obvious? Now get out of my hair, I'm too busy for this s\_\_t.""

As for being scared, listen to your fear to a degree, but don't let it overwhelm you. Use common sense--never be alone anywhere, always be in public, and preferably where there's a video camera or neutral witnesses. Never throw the first punch or obviously taunt someone, but if they throw a punch, remember a few things: 1) You will heal. It may be unpleasant, but that's all--you will recover and live. 2) They can bleed too. 3) You have the right to defend yourself from an aggressor. 4) A good, hard wallop in response while defending yourself to make the other guy back off will take the fight out of a coward, but if you have to hit, hit hard enough to make him back down--don't play around.

ej3d6wo,t3_b3zqu2,"I think the worst thing I did was bully someone in a group of people I hung out with back then and I wouldn‚Äôt say I was friends with a majority of those people but I wanted to be. There was this girl who had a really bad home life and sometimes she‚Äôd tell us she slept with guys and all of the other guys called her a slut and they‚Äôd laugh about it. She‚Äôd get mad or whatever but it seemed to be more playful than anything. I was pretty quiet then. Always watching and reacting because I didn‚Äôt know how to act around them so I stayed quiet.  Until one day someone asked me what I thought about her new story and what she should do to be better. 

I‚Äôll never forget the look of desperation in her eyes when she looked at me. I was so shocked everything blurted out of me unfiltered. And the fucked up thing is, I thought I was helping her. So I called her slut, but unlike everyone else I really meant it. And I just dug into her. I went in on every detail of every story and told her how slutty and shitty she was for doing it. I was trying to help but I kept making it worse and worse with every word that came out of my mouth. I made her cry and someone at the table pushed me out of my chair and I was confused because I thought I was being like them. I was trying to fit in with them. But really I was being an asshole to someone who needed kindness. 

It took me a long time to realize why I did it. I tried not to think about it for a long time because I never thought that I could be that cruel to someone. But I was, and I don‚Äôt ever want to be that insecure boy looking to fit in by being a cruel asshole ever again. It‚Äôs not worth the loss of sleep at night. ",t3_b3zqu2

I always thought that bullies would always be the same and would continue to treat some people badly even into adulthood.

ej7e5wo,t1_ej5ztzr,"The only thing I‚Äôve done was name calling as a kid (lame ones when I think back on it) but as I got older I‚Äôve never done any of practical bullying

But when I moved to another school I had it bad! And they were with types of people where I could of said something to those and really HIT them in the FEELS! 

I had a girl who was morbidly obese she kept calling me a freak and compared to her I was short and I was a size 10 

I had another girl who when I met her I thought she was a guy I could tell she tried so hard to look feminine but she gave me a hard time

I had a few boys in my class who really picked on me when one day one of the boys mother died and he still picked on me but I never made a comment on his dead mother as I thought he‚Äôll probably beat the shit out of me 

I‚Äôve had girls call me a dyke when I openly told my friend what I think I‚Äôm ‚Äúcurious‚Äù but after some experimenting I found in into guys and now to this day the girls who made fun of me because of that are full blown lesbians but I think at this day and age now people don‚Äôt bully homosexuals I remember a friend of mine waited til his very last day in school to come out and when he told me my response was ‚ÄúI know and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that!‚Äù 

My dad he doesn‚Äôt even tolerate bullying I posted a story of how my dad handled a bully yes it was kinda extreme but telling the school or just avoiding them all together just wouldn‚Äôt work 

When I walked home from school I used to have a group of boys waiting for me so they can throw stones at me even bricks anything that can do damage! I came home on scratches bruises sometimes my clothes all ripped as they grab me while I tried running away 

(Check my story ‚Äúdads are the best‚Äù for the full story) 

My dad followed me walking home without me knowing and when he saw what those lads were up to he grabbed the main bully by the neck(well his jacket close to his neck) and threatened to kill him if he and his friend so much as looked at me ever again and damn it bloody worked my dad scared him that much the boys avoided eye contact with me

After what my dad did for me if I have kids I‚Äôd probably be that kind of parent if anyone bullied my kid

eecwwh1,t3_ah8nvq,"Ok, here an annecdote from my school days:

When I got to 8th grade and I, for the first time, had somewhat of a friend group, we often talked shit about others. One of them was a girl called Bianca. And the headhoncho of our group, Lukas (who I am pretty sure is somewhere at home in the dark triad) was pretty much the guy that declared girls desirable or undesirable. And that day he chose to talk shit about that Bianca girl and how ugly she was. Here something interesting: I agreed with him, in front of him (because I was a spineless bastard at the time, but that is what several years of bullying do to you). And so did our whole friend group.

Here is the catch: I found Bianca incredibly pretty. And I knew of 2 others in that group of 5 that also thought so.

So why did we agree with him? Because we weren't confident and we feared losing social status. Disagreeing with Lukas meant to open yourself up to critcism, even mockery. So we rather even upped his opinion, than contradicted it.

What I wanna say is: When someone utters his negative opinion about someone else in front of others, it's more likely that he wants to hurt you, or that he fears losing status, than that he is actually saying something genuine. Because honestly, what healthy and normal person goes around saying insulting shit about others?

That said, yes, this sort of stuff is incredibly hurtful, and other peoples bigger problems really are irrelevant for how bad you were hurt by that.",t3_ah8nvq

Bullying is victimization and traumatic, it leaves deeps scars in you, so don't expect this to get better fast, my bullying ended 8 years ago and I still struggle with it every day.

ed4x7ld,t3_a5ds97,"There is life afterwards, trust me. I had a similar situation. A girl I dated my first three months my freshman year at a college... She dumped me for another guy and started spreading all sorts of rumors about me. Foolishly, I poured my heart out to this girl and she went out of her way to try and ruin my life. Keep in mind, this was at a Baptist Bible college. 

After my freshman year I left, with good reason. Three years later I thought I escaped it, but once I began talking to a girl who started going to that college, these rumors started surfacing yet again. Several people there who ""knew"" me went out of their way to speak to her and the dean, and told her to stop talking to me. There were literally faculty members who were believing this crap and advising her to stay away from me. Yet not one person, including faculty, was ever able to give substance to any accusation when confronting her, even despite her demanding to know. Even the faculty believed these lies, and were out to get me. 

This girl I dated my freshman year destroyed my reputation there, and I spent that spring semester into the fall incredibly hurt and severely depressed. This is a Christian college we're talking about. The most popular or ""godly"" kids were often the most rotten and awful who could literally talk their way out of any situation because of their social status. All sorts of things I wouldn't even think about  doing. The students we were told to look up to as ""godly people"" and the ""future of the church."" These guys were caught doing immoral things with girls but getting off free while the girl gets kicked out. Other guys who abused their girlfriends verbally and emotionally somehow get to stay in the school and even hold positions of leadership. It's an awful, toxic place.

Also, I should note. The new girl I was talking to 3 years later, we are now engaged and getting married this summer. üòä

Sometimes horrible things happen to you. The people you think you could trust can easily turn  around and leave. It's not fair at all. But you can't dwell on it. I lost an entire year because of that, and it's definitely something I regret. Perhaps, try to make amends with some of those friendships. And I know how social anxiety is, but the sooner you get yourself out there, the sooner you will start building some good friendships.

eazhij2,t3_a2dboz,"Thanks for doing this, I'm currently in the middle of some examinations, so I won't be able to write all my tips down at once. I'll periodically return to make edit additions to this comment. 

I'll write down tips that can apply to a school and/or workplace environment. So some tips might make more sense depending on the context. Some of these will be copy pasted from posts I've made in the past to others.

Also if anyone disagrees or thinks I can modify a tip, feel free to criticize. 

**Practical Tips**:

1.) Keep a record in a notebook, at home, written in pen. At the end of every day write down anything that happened relating to your bullying situation. Note down the date and the time anything was said, and the names of all parties involved. Also write what your response was.

In the future if things were to worsen or you need to jog your memory or prove a claim, doing this could help you out.

2.) Does your school/workplace have security cameras? If so, take note of their locations. If you absolutely need to communicate with your bullies, try to do so in view of the cameras. So they cannot make false allegations against you. And will think twice about harming you.

3.) Workplace: If you need to communicate online, try to do so with email and write professionally. This way there is a paper trail of communications all in one place. Have a good password on this email and your computer so it does not get hacked. 

4.) Download a voice recording app to your phone in case you ever need to discreetly record an audio conversation. Be aware of the laws in your state/province/country regarding this. These laws specify either one or two party consent recording.

If you want to make a video recording of a situation, try to do so discreetly so as not to attract the bullies attention. If you get caught recording by the bully, do not let them take your phone. Otherwise they will likely break it/steal it to destroy any evidence you have. Ensure that the video quality is good (at least 720p) so people watching can clearly see the parties involved and what is happening.

Copy and store these video/audio recordings on multiple devices (computer, USB drive) so should something bad happen to one device, you have backups on other devices. Password protect these devices with good passwords.

5.) Be cautious about HR/Management/school administration. Unfortunately, sometimes people are more concerned about preserving reputation or avoiding legal consequences than doing the right thing. And you might end up with more enemies.

**Cyberbullying**: 

1.) Take screenshots of the online bullying interactions. Try to get the date and time (usually bottom right hand of computer) also in the shot. Save these screenshots to a USB drive and print them out. 

2.) Block the bullies accounts.

3.) If this function exists, ""report"" your bullies accounts for ""bullying"" or ""harassment"". They may get taken down.

4.) Should step 2 & 3 fail, either give up social media, or create a new account and be wary of who you give your new account details to so the bullies won't find your new one.

**Tips for Mental Health**:
*So for those who feel psychologically impacted by those events.

1.) Depression and anxiety are common psychological consequences for bullying victims. As such commonly recommended tips do go a long ways in helping. Having a good exercise routine is essential. Although what defines a good exercise routine depends on the person. Some people prefer cardio exercises. Others prefer weight/strength training. Some people might feel satisfied exercising once or twice a week, while others may need to do so everyday. Find what your normal is and what your exercise preferences are.

Usually starting out small and gradually building up leads to the best long term results. Starting small can look like taking a walk around your neighborhood once a week. Or going for a 15 minute jog once a week. Over the course of weeks or months you can slowly increase the time and frequency of your sessions.

2.) Getting the right amount of sleep is important. For most people this is anywhere from 6-8 hours of sleep a night. Also sleeping at the right time to abide by the circadian rhythm is just as important.

3.) Seeking out therapy is also a good thing to try. There is no shame in doing so. A therapist can offer advice and a different perspective on your situation

If you are short on cash, finding affordable therapy can be challenging. However, there are free/low cost options out there. Be on the look-out for terms like ""sliding scale"". Universities and colleges usually offer free/low cost options for their students. Some workplaces these days offer benefits that include therapy sessions, so find out if your workplace offers these.

4.) Try meditation to deal with stress and/or depression. There are different kinds of meditation so find one to your liking (ex. Mindfulness, Deep Breathing, etc).

5.) Keep a journal. Write down your thoughts and anything else on your mind.

6.) Take cold showers.

7.) When thinking about your bullying experience, frame it from the perspective of what you can learn from the situation. This type of thinking is more productive and lessens your risk of developing or worsening depression.

8.) Get enough sunlight. 

**Finding Social Groups**

1.) meetup.com/Facebook/Reddit/Discord groups in your city

**Reading**:

1.) An academic journal article I've found to be really insightful titled: Bully victimization and emotional problems in adolescents:moderation by specific cognitive coping strategies?

It's not open-access (free), but if you are a student, or know a student they can likely download the article free through their educational institution. Some public libraries and workplaces also have subscriptions to these journals so you may be able to access the full thing through there. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Bully+victimization+and+emotional+problem+s+in+adolesce+nts%3A+Moderation+by+specifi+c+cognitive+coping+strategies%3F

But in case you can't access it I'll just paste the parts that were the most insightful to me.

""In general, the results suggest that by using cognitive styles such as Rumination, Catastrophizing and Self-blame people may be more vulnerable to emotional problems than others and that by using other styles, such as Positive Reappraisal or Positive Refocusing people may be more resilient.""

""Positive reappraisal, referring to thoughts of attaching a positive meaning to the event in terms of personal growth; Positive refocusing, referring to thinking about joyful and pleasant issues instead of thinking about the actual event."" ",t3_a2dboz
eb25ljd,t3_a2dboz,"In context of the frequently given advice to just punch your bully, I think the following should be included into the list:

Use of force against bullying is not the be-all-end-all solution to bullying that is suggested, especially by older generations. They grew up in times when the tone in schools was rougher and brawls weren't minded too much. Nowadays, schools are extremely sensitive on the subject, and in the case of a bullying victim using force against its abusers, this rather plays into the hands of the bully, than the hands of the victim.

Most bullying is verbal and social abuse. The sinister part in that is, that victims often have extremely little options to defend themself in any way. Talking back, even if you are funny, is often laughed off, or parroted to make it ridicolous. The logical option, and one I find effective, too, is to firmly plant your fist into the loudmouths face. That might sound attractive, until you put it this way: You just responded to words with violence, most likely in front of witnesses that are already against you. All they have to do now, is report the bullying victim to a teacher, for all kinds of sanctions against you, going up to police reports being filed and the bullying victim facing the possibility of jailtime. These days, punching a bully enables them to abuse their victims with the force of law. 

And the last place a bullying victim wants to go to is jail. Because the abuse there only gets worse.

There is a place for legit self defense, but even in school, it has to be self defense under the law. The school might still sanction, but the state won't.

Learn your local self defense laws. Learn your legal rights. If you have to defend yourself and it leads to a police investigation, lawyer up and do not make statements about what happened until you spoke to your lawyer.

This might sound extreme, but this is to keep your out of jail. It's better to leave a school you are being bullied at, than get into trouble with the law.

e8zq380,t1_e8z6y7q,"Thanks for your support. My son doesn't want to switch classes since he loves most of the kids in it and he likes his teacher (even though she's not helping much in this situation), so if this continues and nothing else gets him to stop, I will insist this bully should move to another class, not my kid. He's the one who should have to move. 
I wanted to add, when this first started happening, I thought it would be a one time incident. 
Me and another mom had volunteered to help with a project in the class back in late September. I had seen this mom around before, but I didn't realize she was John's mother until that day. 
I wavered about if I should bring this issue up to her. I did, but I was careful with my words so as not to upset her or make her feel defensive. 
I said, ""Oh you're John's mom? Apparently my son and yours got off to a bad start with each other.""
J's mom, ""Oh? What happened?""
Me, ""Well, I've only heard my son's side of the story, but I believe it started yesterday with a misunderstanding and my son felt John was saying that he's the dumbest kid in class. Ms. Miller (the teacher) had a discussion with them and John said he was just joking and D___ (my son) took it seriously and got upset. Now it's caused some tension between the two and I hope they can move on from it.""
J's mom upset, ""John knows better than to talk to someone else that way. I raised him better than that! He is in so much trouble when he gets home!""
Me, ""Uh, please don't get upset. His side of the story may be different. It probably was a one time thing (not!) and I'm sure they'll be fine. Don't be too hard on him.""
J's mom, ""Well, thanks for letting me know.""
She was a nice lady and I felt things were going to be okay, but I was wrong. John does seem like a little psychopath. He's very savvy and doesn't care about punishments or what anyone thinks of him.
Now I wonder if his mom was just giving me a line of BS and she knows damn well what kind of kid he is and doesn't care or what. He seems very skilled at getting what he wants. 
They are gonna get sick of me showing up at school unless they have effective ways of dealing with this. Anti-bullying pep rallies and T-shirt don't quite do it. 
I'll see what the principal says on Monday.

I do not like her parents though.

I am going to guess that the bullying stems from her being overweight, which is not her fault, she is a kid. Her parents are shit bags imo. I personally consider parents who allow their children to become obese to be abusing their children. My parents are like that and it drives me crazy as an adult. My sisters(32 & 28( cannot even go to the park with their kids without almost passing out because of their poor health. These parents are setting her up for a shorter life span, possibly more bullying, self esteem issues, health issues (joint damage, diabetes) etc. I think in these cases government should be involved to help provide better guidance for the children. I wish her the best.

But I recently read a really interesting article about obesity that I think you might find interesting too. It talks about how obesity is not causing health issues like we think and there is often too much emphasis put on weight by society and health professionals. Let me know what you think...

I have watched my step mother (250 lbs @ 5'2""), she is 39, suffer at least 20 broken ankles now, knee surgery as of last week, my stepfather multiple knee surgeries, all of them either blood pressure or diabetes issues. They can't go for walks, can't do intense things period. My dad (300+ lbs @ 5'10"")  wouldn't be like he is now if hadn't been obese. My dad fractures his joints/ankles monthly from just walking into the door of his home. Obesity absolutely causes health problem. That HAES stuff is a danger to society. These are small examples, I have lived with and watched my entire families health deteriorate my entire life, around 50 people, not one of them who is obese is without obesity related health issues.

edit: In addition, I had a friend recently recovered fully from a aneurysm, in therapy he mentioned there being a lack of obese people to a nurse who responded ""Obese people don't usually survive heart attacks or aneurysms"". He does Muay Thai like 5 days a week, very fit guy and  ~~lucky~~  made good decisions that saved his ass. He is only 49.

Now, what you shared was a very opinionated piece with many calls to emotion for forming opinions from a HAES guy, who happens to be obese. [Video of the author of the article you shared](https://youtu.be/9222RTMGRTU).

I had been fucking a supervisor and she had fucked her way into upper management, so I slut shamed her to hr after I got the axe when she started fucking some other dude on the sales floor after I cheated on her.

duec6ty,t3_7y4vwm,"One other thing I forgot to mention. Seek mental help as soon as possible, whether you think you need it or not. Like I said before, I thought my troubles would be over when high school ended and I never had to see these people again. But bullying (especially situations that have lasted years) leaves invisible scars, false/limiting beliefs and mindsets that will hold you back in the future if they are not resolved. You are not weak to seek mental help. Quite the opposite. Seeking mental help also does not mean you are crazy. I wish someone told me these things many years ago.

The state of mental health services isn't in a great place these days, and I truly empathize with those that have trouble finding it. However, the words ""seek and you shall find"" have never rung truer for me. A lot of the mental health services out there are expensive, but I was able to find low-cost/free options. They are out there.

I know a lot of school, universities and colleges offer free or low cost mental counselling/therapy for their students. Sometimes charities also run their own counselling. I would encourage all of you to try it out. 

But remember if you do decide to try it out, counselling/therapy is one of those things that is more rewarding the more you invest into it. Don't be surprised if its not helping if you skip sessions, or barely go, or don't speak openly and honestly about how you feel, or fail to keep an open mind.  ",t3_7y4vwm

calyk9h,t3_1gnpy5,"This happened on the city of Hermosillo, Sonora, in Mexico. The video was recorded by one of the classmates, and it is clear that no real attempts were made by others to stop the fight; on the contrary: cheers can be heard. The girl looks bigger and stronger than him, so when the fight seemed to be over he was mocked by male classmates and incited him to take revenge. That's when he grabbed her by the neck and applied a lock leaving her unconscious on her seat.

It is said that no teacher was present at the moment of the fight, and that the school's Principal did not want to take hands on the matter. Now a committee of parents are taking the subject to authorities.

**UPDATE**: here's a link to a news article in english: http://www.latinospost.com/articles/21703/20130618/mexican-bullying-video-goes-viral-causes-outrage-internet.htm

**UPDATE**: It has come to the light that the boy who took the video ""fueled"" the agressor (who happens to be a kid with some ""special needs"") all of the time. Full video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEaBl8diQOg",t3_1gnpy5

c8x5c4y,t3_1a5hih,"There is an amazing documentary on Netflix simply titled ""Happy"". Watch it. 

You can never be happy until you are happy with yourself. You can never be happy with yourself until you come to terms with those who made you feel like less of a person. If you carry around resentment and pain, that pain *will* consume you. You have no chance at happiness.

",t3_1a5hih
c8z8o1l,t3_1a5hih,"Don't know if ''forgiving'' is the right word for me, but rather ''come to terms with.'' I accept what has happened and look forward rather than looking back allthough the flashbacks still haunt me from time to time. I sometimes see the bully that was an asshole to me in middle school when I go out on town. Just like the stuff that happened with you at the funeral he greets me like an old friend, and that's it.

He also had an abusive father as a kid, just like the person that fucked with you. But I can tell you this right now; I also had an abusive father, he didn't live at home but I sure have seen him smack my mother around a few times too many (and he slapped me to the ground when I tried to defence her once) and he was generally an asshole to me when I grew up on several occasions. But did that make me a bully? Did that make feel like degrading others and talk shit? No, it did not. I never bullied another person. It's a choice, and regardless of background that person was a fucking dick to you.

As I said earlier; I've come to terms with what happened. I have a different life right now. Other things to deal with. Different friends that doesn't degrade me or talk behind my back. I've grown kinda cold and distrust is something I have to deal with as well. But that's allright, I have friends that actually mean it when they apologize if something should happen. I'm sure I take it more close to heart than them if an arguement happens. And sometimes I see confusion when it comes to understanding the situation from their pov, but that's allright.. Even if they don't understand, at least they care enough to make up for it and talk it through as friends. Mutual respect is the key here. And that is something bullying taught me when teachers and the board didn't give a shit about my situation. Regardless of authority I'm giving respect to those that deserve it. That's a strength not many people are able to see past.

I didn't learn to understand everyday people and get friends that didn't know of my past until I learned to let go and just be ''me''. The hatred, pain, resentment for what happened, rage, anger, flashbacks.. They're still there, but they fade in comparison to how they was when I constantly tried to understand why it happened to me, what I had done to deserve it and how much I wanted to beat them up with a baseball bat..

No matter what, nothing can change the past, but we can still change the future for ourselves. If the bullies manage to live a great life after doing something like this they are not worth my attention at all. They are not someone I want in my life and definately not someone I want to have on my mind no matter how much I hate them. So, I chose to accept my past in order to do so and let go as much as I can.

It's liberating to just.. Let go. Especially after it has been a part of you for so long. It might not feel right at the time and justice sure isn't served, but more often than not; It never is. But accepting what happened and moving on is something definite that we can do to better our day-to-day life. Ending up in prison and/or getting fines for beating someone up isn't one of them.

I don't know, I was only bullied for about 2-3 years and my mother was understanding compared to what you had to deal with. And I genuinly feel for you. I was also afraid of going outside in my neighbourhood for quite some time. But truth be told, letting go is how I manage to deal with it. It's a one step of the time, but it works and I honestly believe that I'll be fully rocevered in 1-3 years time (I'm 24 now and depression has been present now and then for about 5 years). Just recently I've been able to let it go. Accept what has happened and move on.

You can do it, the future is brighter than the past my friend.",t3_1a5hih
c9sw7o2,t3_1a5hih,"One, I do forgive. He wanted to be different, something, I don't know. I slightly forgive him, anyways. It still hurt. It still made me feel like shit. But I don't hold it against him. I don't mention it. I still remember it all the way from 6th grade when he first called me a lesbian. 

  The other one, I can't and never will be willing to. She thought it'd be fun to hit me like it'd impress the other guy because he was doing it (but more verbal, less physical). There's no chance she will change from her hostile self towards me, even if now she's more verbal like he was, less physical. ",t3_1a5hih

c8vciji,t3_1a5hih,"NO!!! Screw you bully! 1st grade. I don't even remember your stupid name. You and your dumb butch-cut bully friend, who, to this day, I have no idea if they were a boy or a girl, used to make fun of me on the bus! ""do you have a pencil?"" you'd ask. I'd respond ""yeah, I got a ton of them at home!"". You laughed in my face and wouldn't tell me why. You asked again, and laughed some more. But I figured it out. By pencil, you meant penis. You dumb little prick! How was I suppose to know!? NOBODY ELSE CALLS PENISES PENCILS. You made me feel so dumb. ""I should have known!"" I thought. I was so embarrassed. I'm glad you got yelled at on the bus that one day. The bus driver stopped the entire bus just to verbally assault you for a full 60 seconds in front of everyone. The entire bus cheered and laughed. You cried. You cried like a little priss and I embraced it. 

Justice >:) ",t3_1a5hih
c8znw0j,t1_c8x5c4y,"   I was bullied from Middle School through High School and I can tell you it isn't easy to forgive or forget. Every now and than when I hear about a poor soul who committed suicide or did a school shooting I get mixed feelings. Yes I want justice, yes I want blood for blood an eye for an eye. But is it right? No of course not. 
It's been three years since my Graduation. Even though I've started over, have many friends,  I get nightmares, day dreams of what I could have done to those who tormented me. And to be honest that scares me. It scares me because even though I will never see them again, I will continue to hate them for the rest of my life. Hell I've even had day dreams of going after their future families. I banish the thoughts but the fact that I thought of it terrifies me. 
   Perhaps I may never find peace with that portion of my life. But I have found ways to turn that anger, the hatred into other meaningful things like poems and stories. Even games like League of Legends give me some comfort from those nightmares. 
Enjo you are right that you cannot be happy unless your happy with yourself. But for someone like me who has felt anything but that for 10 years of their life it's very hard to move on from something traumatic like that.",t3_1a5hih
c8znwii,t1_c8vciji,"I pity you, I really do.",t3_1a5hih
c8zy29m,t1_c8znw0j,"Let me share my experience:

In my formative years I was small (tall and extremely skinny really). I was smart, but I simply had no social intelligence. Worse yet I wasn't an introvert, just a really ineffective extrovert. Meaning I'd put myself out there, only to be slapped down in ever increasing hostile fashion. I was also a military child which meant that I had the privilege of being bullied in many different places, by many different people. This somehow made it worse, as it was a really terrible cycle. I'd got to a new school, full of hope, and within a week it would be completely crushed. I was abused, beat-up, called names and generally made to feel horrible about myself.

In college I managed to turn all of this around, but the pain lingered. I'm quite a bit older than you, but I very much share your experience. In my 20's, every now and then, something would happen that would instantly transport me back to being that miserable, scared, and emotionally destroyed teenager. I constantly worried. I worried about what other people thought. I worried about my newly found friends turning on me. I worried about my relationships at work. My school experience created non-stop anxiety in my life.

Somewhere along the way I managed to convince an amazing woman to love me. After being married for more than a decade, and being together for much longer than that she left me. Out of the blue (at least I thought so). Talk about a wake-up call!

I looked inside myself and found out that the pain and anxiety had stuck with me. It built on itself until I reached the point that I just kind of shut down. I became mean. I became cynical. I became a lesser version of myself. Here I was a highly successful (professionally at least) adult, with great friends, and an amazing wife. Yet all of that support couldn't overcome my pain. 

I started to see a therapist, and it was transformative. She first taught me how to *cope* with anxiety, and then how to deal with those very painful issues underneath it. For the first time in my life I could live in the moment. I could *feel* and articulate it. I began to treat other people with kindness. I began to treat my wife with respect. It wasn't until I released the pain and forgave the people who had inflicted it on me that I could live a full life.

My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner.

My wife and I are working on reconciling. In my internalized and selfish state I had inflicted a lot of unintentional pain on her. She's working to understand it. She was the victim of bullying herself, and the whole thing gets very emotionally complicated. Thankfully she loves me, and I fully believe we'll survive this.

Basically people who have been abused pick up certain habits like saying sorry a lot for no reason or become jumpy.  Basically from what it sounds like you have a phobia of being touched due to the physical abuse.

It is possible to get PTSD from bullying. I was diagnosed with it (well, once. Then with social anxiety. Then with depression. Long journey, I'm rather convinced I have it, and I am in trauma therapy now). 

I would say, first, read the symptoms, as [coded in the ICD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK207191/box/part1_ch3.box19/?report=objectonly), and see what applies to you.

I want you to know that I've been bullied for years and that all their bullshit talk has nothing to do with who you are. High school, despite being super shitty and lonely, means nothing to me. I don't even care about the people there because I KNOW that they're too weak to handle what we go through.

I have two ways of dealing with people: 

I am very, very nice to everyone, and extremely honest. As a result, the majority of the people will be super super supportive of me. 

But when I come across the occasional psychopath (someone who intentionally puts you down to feel better about their pathetic selves), I give them the WORST fight of their lives. They get sent to the principal's office for bullying, they get in trouble with the police if they hit me. Both have happened before, and I only wish I had fought for myself sooner. 

But I didn't because like you, I didn't realize that I had value. You have value, you can do this. I kid you not, but you just need to believe in yourself and you need to stand up for yourself and say: ""Hey that's pretty fucking rude of you to say that. Get the fuck out of my face we're breaking up now."" You don't even have to be angry, just say: ""Hey that's really mean, but ok. We're done, have fun being alone.""",t3_dqi5jg

I'm still struggling, but thanks to therapy and my life experiences, I generally just need to remember who I am and what I can and Will accomplish. 

That's another thing, set goals for yourself and whenever you feel socially inadequate remind yourself of those goals. Remember we're cheering for you even though we're miles apart. And if you fail, that's ok. Just keep at it. 80% of the NBA champion Le Bron's shots are misses. But it's the 20% that put him into the Hall of Fame.

But there are some people who go through life, like its their life mission, to knock people down and use Them until Theres nothing left. I think you gave me much more than the 2 psychologist could give me.",t3_dqi5jg
f7dddja,t1_f78a4a8,"Validation. Because it's true. We should absolutely recognize the problem. Wether it's crazy coincidence (I doubt it because you can tell they're pricks.) or they're really good at hiding it, pretending that they are not hurting us is wrong. That is why if someone says something mean, immediately tell them that they are being rude. Or ask: ""I'm sorry, what did you say?"" They're cowards so they'll back down. Or maybe they genuinely didn't realize that they were being rude. It's always best to ask them immediately. Cut the head off the baby snake before it morphs into something else. Their friends will respect you. They may not do anything, but at least they will feel too guilty to join in with the bullying. That's a great way to undermine the bully's sense of control. To crumble their hold on their followers. 

And whining is absolutely fine, we're all here for you.",t3_dqi5jg

I know it sucks to put it like that but office bullying always seems to place a burden on the victim to handle.  This is a good start because at least HR knows something is up.  After that gather what proof you need.   Document everything by writing down the time, the place and what happened. Record every email, text and if allowed even video or audio of each event.  

And no, your not in the wrong for smacking that guy away, he had no right to touch you.",t3_dlfch2

f4vs6ic,t3_dlfch2,"Yes, you need to talk to someone, but there must be someone higher up than your boss. Usually HR (Human Resources) will listen to someone who claims there is inappropriate behavior in the office. For what he tried to do to you, he had no right to touch you. You were telling him to back off. Report that to HR and the other incidents. Don't wait, the bullying might get worse for you or someone you know. It might get far more psychical and emotional in the future and HR needs to step in now and show them what they have been doing to you and everyone else.

f4zkayk,t1_f4vs6ic,"Thing is though that they're not bullying anyone else, from what I've seen. Only me. The other thing is that they both usually have lunch with my boss, so I don't know if he is going to be biased and deny my claims. Since they don't bully anyone else, I don't have anyone to take with me to make a statement. I have my coworker who is a frequent witness, but he thinks I'm ""exaggerating"" and they're ""only joking"". He also thinks that going to my manager would be a child's way of solving such an issue (his exact words), and seems to think this would negatively impact my image in my manager's eyes (he will think I'm too weak and sensitive).

In any case, I already told my manager there is a sensitive subject I would like to discuss with him, so I guess now there's no going back. I'll have to tell him regardless of whether I go to HR or not. I also confronted one of the bullies via text messages yesterday. I only told him there is something of paramount importance I'd like to discuss with him. Like all bullies when confronted, his weakness and insecurities immediately came out and were apparent in his replies. He said he knows what's up and that he hopes he hasn't offended me.

I would tell my newer friends my worries, especially if i felt close to them, just because the are your friends and its good to talk about stuff with friends. 

I think the best way to stand up for yourself is to know that you don't need to give a fuck about what shitty people think of you. Know that your number one goal should be taking care of your future prospects (im assuming youre a student), and lifting up people who also want to lift you up.

For most of my life I've been in a cycle of being put on a pedestal and then scapegoated, and although I can feel the benefits of working on my confidence, making myself more accountable, etc. it has done its share of damage. I'm unaware of the trait I have that's attracts it. I was a pushover for a few years and I have some related tendencies that pop up, but I am definitely not on the level of insecure I was then.

A lot of the intimidation I used to have became annoyance and my older respect isn't there. Confrontation sounds easier now, but I don't want to attract attention for the wrong reasons, have to explain myself, and feel like I'm operating in a completely different bubble of logic than everyone else.

The biggest obstacle is it would affect my current impression of struggling. I don't know if I can build up enough confidence in time before the bully decides they're going to act out again, but I don't want to flaunt any of it immediately and make them take further measures to create more problems for me to solve.

Victims tend to lack social awareness, and react impulsively to the bully (you throwing rocks) without thinking of who's watching and how others might see that. Bystanders and observers (principal) just see the outburst and not the events leading up to the outburst. So often times the victim is blamed or has their reputation tarnished.

Any sort of violence, even self defense, was always taboo, and I ought to go to the proper authorities, that never helped. That was drilled into my skull. It took me years to lose this attitude, and only when 15 years old, being bullied for 8 years, I finally flipped my shit on someone. And I had to fight several times after that, over the course of another 4 years to finally have my peace.

That the damage was done at this point is clear. Also, not all kids will develop that mindset. Not all kids grow up to be rather strong, many will have peaceful natures and all of that. Maybe the bullies are simply too dangerous. And then of course enters the lunacy of ""No-tolerance"" policies, that even punish victims for self defense.

That being said please don't ever use any object as a weapon against anyone. Even if there was no intention to use it you will still end up being the one in trouble. Most likely had the craft knife not been a part of the situation he would be forced to apologise to you now.

It's awful that he's lying but that's what jerks like that do. They lie and act like the victim in front of others. Okay so what to do about the apology. How about if it's simply phrased as I apologise for holding a craft knife to you. It's very specific and doesn't account for the rest of the fight which he did start. It's much better than I'm sorry for everything.

Now this sounds like an infantile trick but it works. Next time he says anything to you. Just mimic it back to him. For example he asks if you're a boy you say back to him in one of those copycat voices, ""are you a boy?""
No matter what he says to you keep that up. It's annoying as hell and he won't be able to get a rise out of you. Plus he can't tell on you because you are only repeating what he says. Like I said, juvenile but effective.

Wenn ja, marschiert ihr alle zu euren Klassleitungen und danach zum Vertrauenslehrer wenn ihr sowas habt. Wenn die Reaktion nicht passt, ab zum Rektor. Von dem was du schreibst ist das ein Serienmobber, und solche Leute verpesten das Schulklima bis sie gestoptt werden.

A robber or rapist might do it by asking you for a light, to see how aware you are and how confidently you respond, or by doing something friendly in a really pushy way, like asking to carry your groceries (Source for that is the Book ""The Gift Of Fear"")

exkaw7o,t3_ct7wk8,"Tell your husband if you have started hurting yourself; he can't dismiss that if he's got half a brain.

Try to start a dialogue with the bully if you can; level with him that you don't mean to hurt him with your comments, if he retorts that you do, fire back that he hurts you with his. If you are unable to reach some sort of agreement, report back to your husband. He has to believe that you tried to reason with the guy.

If you are still dismissed, you should tell your husband that you won't be sticking around in a room with the bully from now on: arguing that it's best that way because you just can't cope with the dude, so at least you can leave each other alone. Your husband might be more willing to negotiate if he's afraid there will be a scene next time the man comes over, as you suddenly leave the room.

Those are my two cents. You should do what you're comfortable with, and what you feel is right. I agree with u/DekuTheDamnNerd, it's really disappointing that you husband doesn't support you in this, even if he doesn't see what you see: he can't dismiss that your *feelings are real*.

eu96wsd,t3_cfb7ft,"Please don't take this as an expert opinion because I am not an expert, but I have had somewhat similar experiences in the past. Specifically, I had people claim to be my friend and then bully me. 
First of all, do you go to therapy for your depression? If not, then I want you to know that there is no shame in regularily talking to your school counselor or asking your doctor for a reference to a therapist (or however it works where you live). I've been in therapy for about a year now and it feels very freeing to be able to talk about your experiences to a professional. 
Secondly, another thing that has helped me is keeping a journal. It is good for venting and also keeping track of the bullying for when you have to remember your experiences.
Thirdly, it sounds like you have a group of friends that support you, which is great! Try to stick with them and other people who you trust.
My last point is that, sadly, I think you should cut your bully out of your life. Based on your story, I think you did the right thing when you blocked her and you should continue to stay away from her and her friends. Not in a mean way, but clearly and definitely. 
It sounds like you won't be seeing them so much in the future, which is great news for you! The best thing for you would really be to ignore them as much as you can and focus on yourself and the people who actually care about you. 
Right now it is the summer holidays and anxiety builds up for the coming school year, but try to remember that things often end up better than you thought they would. You have gone through bad times already, so you know you can do it! And it gets better, it really does!

I didn‚Äôt realize how much it changed who I was until much later in life. The only thing I regret from that time in my life was believing what my bully told me I was. I wish I was able be strong and love myself and not let them change me. I wish I was also more vocal about what was going on instead of trying to hid it. I never brought it up to anyone in my life who could have helped me. If you need to report when she is being mean and abusive, she is brining the consequence on herself. Make it uncomfortable and hard for her to bully you. The biggest thing for me liking back is I let the relationship I had with my bully define relationships I had for years.

It's weird to think that I once felt safe talking to these people. 
I'm afraid of them even though it's been almost a month. I'm afraid to look for jobs, because what if they ran a misinformation campaign? 

I had that same fear in the classroom when that woman was bullying me. If I had just said something earlier in the year, and put I stop to it, maybe people wouldn't have been so quick to dismiss me. After all to people in the West, silence implies Ignorance, or Agreement

I'm very socially awkward and sensitive, and people start to assume that because I'm awkward, I'm incapable of working. What's more when they are already given a negative portrayal about me by these more charismatic people? 

I also want you to know that this is the first time I've really started think how to commit suicide.

I feel this way because this mistreatment is a pattern: I'll start off with a good relationship, and itll slowly degrade as they ostracize me, then eventually I implode, and that is when I lash out. 

They always tell me:

 ""I know how you feel BUT..."" 

But they never do. I don't blame them for not feeling the same way, I know im too sensitive, but  
They know I think differently. But they keep assuming I'm intentionally making things difficult, and it's just not true. I have some weird verbal disability in which everything in my head makes sense, but when I try to say it, it comes out garbled, especially when I'm anxious. 

I know i cant make everyone understand, I'm maxed out on an SSRI, and to be honest, if this TMS treatment doesnt work, I might just quit my ambitions. 

This is PTSD. I know it is. Ive even recorded specific times of the days that I go through emotional extremes:

- Anxious (morning before class)
- Fearful (lunchtime, when I worry about being picked on)
- Happy (dismissal)

-Social anxiety disorder

-Generalized anxiety disorder 

-Panic disorder 

-Agoraphobia 

-ADHD

-Major depressive disorder

I'm currently age 35, and the main bullying problems of my life happened when I was 10 years old (plus and minus a few). 10 is quite a formative time, which I've come to personally understand. 

I've made it my primary quest in life to explore the details and foundations of my traumas in order to better understand them and hopefully, eventually be less consumed by them. I read about psychology related to my case every day and have been doing so for maybe 6 years so far. I've made a lot of progress in understanding, but I'm still not sure how to *fix* anything. 

In the meantime, Lexapro (an SSRI antidepressant that also has mild anti anxiety effects ""takes the edge off"") and lorazepam on worse days, helps me to keep stable while I excavate my way through my past looking for clues to the way forward.

But to answer your question directly, I shall just tell you that on my end, I'm going to speak with the teacher about their investigations soon, keep in touch with my counselors who are helping me solve the problem, and figure out how to effectively stop these few assholes in class who have been trying to provoke me in ways that are not as obvious compared to before I reported them for the first time.",t3_c8ontl
es0qzti,t3_c5a9o5,What's the name of your startup? And how do you create environments with less bullying? I'm interested to hear more!!,t3_c5a9o5
es1n77e,t1_es0qzti,"Our name is Soul Force LLC. As a startup we can't do everything, in fact we have to focus on one thing and do it well. Using our base server kids and adults can quickly put together an entire curriculum. Here's a couple things we add - 

* Toxic user/post detection - so human moderators/teachers/parents can sort the top most toxic users/posts from a variety of social networking platforms you can create on the server. there are many different measures of toxicity we'll be using
* Our CEO and at least one director are going to be from the LE community. A platform / environment run by cops is probably going to be safer
* Instead of grades we have missions. Pick a mission and learn about different subjects at once, like learning math in a painless way. Some of our missions are around dealing with difficult/mean people successfully. 
* Building in teamwork in ever mission, where students have to work with other students of skill sets and views. 
* Assisting in building coalitions on missions. learning how to send revolutionary messages and how to measure that. In a Bully environment/world people are divided and not united. Bullies divide. and they do run the show right now on pretty much every level. 
* Assisting in revolution in some of our missions. We've got it down to a science.  A Revolution of social systems is in order and Bullies will soon be on the way out. 

lots of stuff you can do with the platform. But there are many more ideas for products and services that I can't get to I'd be happy to share someday. I always have time to help other startups and non-profits.",t3_c5a9o5

If they are going to be somewhere, try and avoid going there too, even if you have to dodge some school events. Explain to your parents if word gets back to them. They will support you I'm sure. 

&#x200B;

Find new friends. Friends who maybe understand how it feels to be excluded. They don't have to be the bestest friends ever, but sometimes it's nice to have someone you can go to for company. And then, when you feel more comfortable at the school, make different friends.

&#x200B;

If you can compile evidence of their bullying, show them to the principal/guidance counselor and ask if he can change classes you have with them, gym class, etc, or adjust your schedule around.

&#x200B;

Don't accept their bullying. Walk away, even if it means you leave a class. If you can block them on social media, block their numbers, etc, do that.

A general piece of advice I give to all bullying victims is to **document the bullying**.  By that I mean you keep some sort of diary where every day you record incidents of bullying.  Note down the place, time, who bullied you, what they did and said, who witnessed it, how you reacted, etc.  This kind of record will help you present a consistent and detailed story in case you get into a he-said-they-said argument.",t3_c2jknx

eou4hmk,t3_bt4zly,"Nobody can truly be considered 'normal'. Everybody is weird one way or another - its what defines our personalities and ourselves as a human being. People who are considered 'weird' are only called that because people have noticed something about them that makes them unique, and most of the time people don't like that. Some people just don't like seeing others be happy; they could be angry or jealous or just plain rude. However, everybody is a human, and everybody is different, so labelling people as things like this shouldn't even be happening. Everybody is somebody else.

If you are truly considering suicide, then this bullying has gone too far. Talk to somebody you trust, like a counsellour or maybe a teacher. Use a service like Childline as they can surely help you. Nobody deserves to die because of awful things like this, nobody.

ep21tzd,t3_bt4zly,"Don‚Äôt worry about being weird or different. Take it from a guy who has Aspergers and dealt with the same problems as you. Being different is way cooler than changing yourself to suit others. In my case i have a tendencies to run around and flap my hands and tap my Adam‚Äôs apple and even hum when I‚Äôm eating. It was frequently mocked for being antisocial, having strange ticks and likening childish things like cartoons and stuff (I‚Äôm in high school and still watch Ben 10) and pretty much anything I did or showed interest in. I was mocked, shut down and when I got angry and fought back i was regarded as an animal because I accidentally hurt someone  when trying to retrieve my stolen stuff from the bullies and because I growled and screamed at them when I was getting sick of it. I was thought that I was the problem and thought I really was out of place, but I had friends and family to help pull me out of my own head and help me regain some confidence in myself.

I learned that even if am weird and immature, it doesn‚Äôt matter, after all I‚Äôve helped people by mending a friendship and defending others while putting on a brave face. So to sum it up I do things I do because it‚Äôs who I am and I have nothing to be ashamed of and if your someone who stands out from the crowd. Don‚Äôt be ashamed, be proud because our individuality is what makes us human and it allows us to truly express ourselves and if other people can‚Äôt except that then they are just blind sheep who will stay in a herd while we get to be ourselves.

1.) Gandhi created this concept called civil disobedience. It‚Äôs a form of nonviolent or peaceful means of protesting. It‚Äôs when a civilian protests without the use of violence and in most cases controls his or her emotions to behave in the opposite of the expected norm. There is a psychology technique or concept of this, I forget the jargon or terminology for it but basically you react opposite to what is expected. Essentially, when this person bullies you, you smile and give him a compliment. You say something nice about him.

Btw, watch this link. This should seriously help:
https://youtu.be/7oKjW1OIjuw


2.) You could pretend he is literally invisible and does not exist in the room. Now this may be harder and more inevitable because you might always have to deal with him. Basically, pretend he is empty space and there is no one there. When he says something horrible, pretend that you hear a fly buzzing, look out the window, greet someone else, tie your shoes, look at your phone, listen to music, go to the bathroom, anything just do not let anything he says faze you.",t3_brkx87

eo9gvh1,t3_br0iti,"I recently had a rant about this kind of thing on my own blog. It may get your son in trouble, but you can also fight back by documenting the fact that you have already spoken to the boy's father and the principal. Continue to speak to them and continue to document it.

You son will have to take the words, I'm sorry. I recommend getting him a therapist to help him sort with that. My parents never did for me and I have a lot of issues stemming from that. But unfortunately, encouraging your son to fight words with fists will make him the bad guy. Don't put him in that position.

But my mom had a cardinal rule for both her children. If the other party laid so much as a finger on you that you didn't want, you were to defend yourself. Period. If you had to get physical, do not hesitate. You make sure they can't stop you from running away, and find the nearest adult. 

My teachers and principal tried to punish me for the few times I had to do this, but my mother made it clear to all parties that she had been trying to get them to do something and they failed to. If I had to ""just ignore"" the name calling and other verbal abuse, then they had to suck up the fact that I would defend myself at all costs from physical bullying.

Think about it this way. An adult would never be asked to sit there and take an assault. Why do we expect children to do any differently?",t3_br0iti

This Harris person, whom I will say is a sociopathic asshole, sounds like the type of person who will have either forgotten about this incident and deny it outright.

Look at it this way; I'm certain Harris must have teased you because you made him feel secretly insecure on the inside in some way, no doubt by being a far better person than him which he actually knew. And his boorish personality made him act out the way he did. Henceforth, every time you remember this incident, remind yourself you are much much better than him and his actions only single him out as stupid and immature. I can even recommend - as a form of self-therapy - saying out loud to yourself something like 'Harris is ugly and stupid and will always be'(which is probably the truth) every time this incident comes to mind or makes you angry. Repeat this as often as possible until you truly start to believe it deep down, such that Harris seems so insignificant to you to be  worth another thought.)

As for revenge? Well they say forgive, but never forget, so if you ever run into Harris by chance in the future, treat him like a dead man; do not speak or even look at him unless forced to. From my experience, this drives someone like him who thrives off universal attention absolutely crazy. Hopefully karma will get him before you have to deal with him though....",t3_b3j4tj

4-Super Intendant
5-The State‚Äôs Department Of Education

If you could review the rules you have at your school make sure ‚Äúbullying‚Äù (and the type of bullying used against you) is one of the things that are forbidden

Now the next time you are bullied go and tell the teacher (if you don‚Äôt get it, be a snitch, go become a weasel).

Suppose that did not work, (remember the pyramid I mentioned earlier). Now go up, tell them that you are bullied and the teacher (or lower body that you told before) did not respond. 

When you have made it all the way to the top of powers within the school, make your parents go and file a complaint to the principal.

Suppose the school management does nothing, take it to the district, and if that doesn‚Äôt work then the US department of education.

You might be asking (will big bodies like the departments care about my bullying) but at this point it‚Äôs more than bullying.

You are being bullied and the people who should be disciplining the bully aren‚Äôt doing their job. And that needs to stop.

ecw0rdp,t3_aaf428,"There is nothing wrong with your personality. I say that with 100% certainity and without even knowing you. The people that bully you are fucking garbage. You see them getting along with others well, so from that you can categorically exclude your personality being the reason that you are being attacked like that. Because they are garbage, and they do not have that problem.

Here is the thing: Social predators seek victims. Bullies are a type of social predator. When they look for someone to pick on, they don't want a target that puts up a lot of fight, because they can lose that fight. They want somebody to pick on, and they look for someone with enough signs of self-doubt to reasonable be able to believe he or she won't put up a lot of fight being degraded.

So what signs will they be looking for? Someone uncertain, reserved, shy, anxious, etc. Because that are indicators for a person being a good target. It's like blood in the water for a shark. This is why I drew bullies for over a decade.

What you can do is this: Put up resistance. Place healthy boundaries about how you want to be treated. Think about that, what are your boundaries? What is your personal space? What names can't you stand being called?\`(for example, I hate abreviations of my first name, if someone uses one, I ask them to use my full name). What behavior won't you tolerate? 

Then think about how to enforce those boundaries. When will you start recording harrassment? When you report it to a superior? When will you involve police? When will you start smacking people around? Especially when it comes to reporting stuff, know that evidence is important to back you up.

Long-term, you want to rebuild your confidence, which will make most of this stuff automatic. Now, I haven't figured out how to do that exactly, but I know pretty well how to fake it :)",t3_aaf428

He was bullied by a classmate the entire fucking year, despite having it brought to light multiple times (who the fuck gets bullied in kindergarten?!). The school has since been shut down and is now a preschool only. He got more late slips than on times, despite arriving 15 mins before school officially started like clockwork. Their compromise for the bullying, was keeping our son in class during recess, while the 'Bully' goes and enjoys recess. Then they alternate. (son goes and plays, bully stays in class.) that was there idea. Not making the bully go to an entirely different classroom altogether. 

He has an awesome teacher this yr. But school itself is so underfunded it's ridiculous (they don't even have a GYM). if it's any consolation to you Bullhead is the top 5 worst school districts in the nation!!! 

We weren't here in 07. But talking to long time locals, and what we see personally. Shit hasn't changed, at all. If anything, it's gotten worse. Businesses keep going out of business, nothing ever takes their place. If you remember Laughlin Outlet center any, it now has like 7 shops TOTAL, barely hanging on. It's the most pathetic ""mall"" I've ever been too. 

I'm sorry this left you like this. But consider yourself lucky you got out. Few do not. I'm always talking to the kids at the local skate park. And most absolutely HATE the schools they go to. Especially the highschoolers (also highest drop out rate in all of AZ as well) 

We ourselves were planning on moving when our sons school yr was up, but looks like we're stuck here now. Since a family emergency has left us fucked over, and we won't be leaving any time soon, if at all to say the least.

I hate this city with a passion. 

I wish you luck. And I feel ya. It does suck being that way. (I too suffer depression and anxiety) but you'll be alright. Don't let these bitches from your elementary days get you down. Take that power away from them, by becoming the best person you can be. Cuz the more you let it get to you, you are giving them power over you, that they don't deserve. Plus, if they're still here, guaranteed they're either Meth heads, in jail Up in kingman, or trailer trash with an abusive husband/bf and living off the states tit. 


Edit: Forgot to mention. We had to switch his original teacher after the first day as well. Bitch made our son cry, and forced him to sit next to her the entire day. On the FIRST Day of school! I told her initially, that he was super hyper and has ADHD. (which NONE of the schools here are equipped to handle). Which she said was fine. And she was ""used"" to such children. Woman is confined to a motorized wheel chair. How the hell can she control ramboncous toddlers? Other than screaming at them? She's in his new school. Thankfully he didn't end up back with her. School will be over come May. But to this day, her students are STILL crying when they come and leave the school. How she's still a teacher blows my fucking mind. But then again, a Meth head can get hired anywhere here, so....¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

GF wants to wait till he's finished the year, because she doesn't want to remove him sooner. That he'll lose friends? (what friends?

For real, they don't deserve the time you waste, dwelling on it. Also, I feel it's not 100% their fault either. Depends also how you are raised. So it's possible, they did not have a very good home life, thus taking it out on you (which is unfortunate all around of course) because it made them feel better about themselves. Bullying is a sad thing to endure. It is also learned. So in a sense, you should feel sorrier for the bully, more than for yourself. Because more often than not, they are the ones who feel inferior in some way. (I.e. being jealous that you were taller and hit puberty first) It's never the victims fault. And doesn't matter where you are. Bullies are everywhere. I had a knack for befriending most of them, But it doesn't always work.  what does most of the time though, is not GIVING them that power over you. The more you ignore them (if possible) a lot will give up after awhile. In other words, Don't feed into it, they then will have nothing to go on. 

It's a cruel cycle for sure. everyone is different. EVERYONE. and we should work more on accepting those differences, than making others feel like they don't belong. (Something we drill into our own kids. Yet, they should also protect themselves if need be, but ONLY if left no other choice) But unfortunately the world doesn't work like that sadly. It's hard, and I guess you have some things you need to work on. But, that's just it. At least you're TRYING, and that's much better than doing nothing. 

But yeah, this city sucks. And the sooner we ourselves are out of here, the better. 

I hope you get past it. Just be you, don't change yourself, just to fit someone else's agenda (especially when it comes to things you cannot change. Even if you wanted too) Unless it's harmful to you and others of course. Surround yourself with good people. And in time, you'll feel much better about yourself. Environment makes a huge difference too, and can hinder your emotional/mental growth sometimes. Bullying sucks, but you survived it. Therefore, you're already winning Imo.

e9rz1mn,t3_9xf7bw,"Just from reading the abstract, the paper itself is paywalled, isn't that a misrepresentation of Egan & Todorov, 2009? [The abstract](https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/forgiveness-as-a-coping-strategy-to-allow-school-students-to-deal) states that forgiveness is offered as a coping-ressource to bullying victims, and therefore isn't a developed attribute of bullying victims by themself. 

I dug a round a little bit, and found discussions about forgiveness breaking ""the cycle of violence"", which implies for me, that this is specifically a strategy to prevent a bullying victim to become a ""Bully/Victim"", meaning it moves on from a victim role to a perpertator role. So, so far, I don't see any long-term benefit.

> How would your life look if you would be raised in over-protecting social structure where you never have to copy with any social problems whatsoever? 

I refuse to accept this dychotomy, and I do not see bullying as a social problem, like other conflicts are. Bullying is targeted abuse. It's not a misunderstanding, it's not 2 colleagues that hate each other having to work together, it's one person or group seeking to psychologically and socially destabilize their target in a group setting, with a range of behavior from verbal abuse to physical violence. This is not something you can talk out. This is not something you can solve face-to-face. Because your person in this context is worthless. You either need an authority figure by your side, you need to leave, or you need to fight back. 

In school and in workplaces, those 3 options are extremely limited. Stay truant and your parents will give you shit. In some countries, like mine, germany, you will get a police escort to school. Quit your job, and what will you eat? 

Then we have teachers, principals, councellors, bosses and HR departments not taking bullying seriously. I don't know about the current state in businesses, but in schools, authorities ignoring bullying is rampant. 

And then there is fighting. Sometimes you can call the cops, if you can find proof. Sometimes, you can pull authorities on your side after bringing evidence. Both is a long process in which you will be continously abused. Actual violence comes with severe repercussions, and even clear-cut self defense can be undermined if the bully-group testifies the victm is actually the aggressor. 

Bullying is a complete minefield. It is not a normal social problem. For many victims, like for me, it isn't solved in decades. 

After that, to the questions:

> *Do you think being a bully victim made you stronger (/better) person?* 

No.

> *How?* 

I am 25 years old, I was bullied for at least 10 years. I am minimally employed, I live with my parents. I do not have a week without suicidal thoughts, I have so much social anxiety, I cannot sleep anymore before social events and I withdrew over the years nearly completely from social life and from hobbies I enjoyed a lot, like Martial Arts. I have cycles of heavy depressions and insomnia. I freeze for a few seconds every time I hear a group of peer-aged males laughing in my proximity. I endure waves of self-hatred whenever I remember the slightest mistake I ever made during a social interaction. Unless I take enourmous time to formulate responses, I do not know how to communicate with other humans on a personal level. I am unable to function in groups, because I do not know how to behave in them. I struggle concentrating on any longer task. And whenever I go outside, which is not the fields in my small town where I walk my dog, I get so hypervigilant and nervous, I need at least a day to recharge.

I am a psychological train-wreck, and if I don't get better in the next 5 years, and build some resemblance to a life, I likely won't make it to 30, because I'mma take a train the way you shouldn't take a train.

e9sny28,t3_9xf7bw,"For me, forgiveness came with the understanding that most of those that bullied me came from backgrounds that were limiting in some capacity. I think I was targeted, due to jealousy and cultural differences. As I grew older, I witnessed the dark paths that a lot of the bullies took - most if not all either dropped out or simply didn't make anything of themselves or their lives. Honestly, it makes me sad that they didn't have access to the same resources and more quality upbringing that I did. Forgiveness came through the understanding that they were just kids, most often from bad at-home situations - I feel that they were simply at horrible disadvantage, that I would never wish upon any child.

I do think bullying contributed to my high social anxiety in my teens and early twenties, but I eventually matured out of it ---> I strongly feel that social anxiety is something that you shouldn't feed. You must actively challenge/expand your comfort zones. Challenge and put yourself in uncomfortable social situations.

As far as making me ""stronger"", I feel that it was more crippling, more of a setback, as I didn't have the resources to properly process and carrying me through that time and years after. I feel lucky to say that I've healed from those experiences but that took a lot of time, years to overcome. Did it make grow a backbone? Sure.

I was feminine, the mental pressure to change my behaviour, from the way I talked to the way I gesticulated, walked.. the fear and anxiety of being scrutinised in every little thing folded me into myself. I have been used as a punching bag, as the scapegoat of every group so many times, that I assume that role in all walks of life - friend groups, at work, among family. The truth is that I am not strong, and I never became strong because I never had the chance to become strong. The times I was not on anti-depressants, I was lonely, bitter, spiteful. It has fucked me up in so many ways, it has made me think lesser of me. A reddit post forced me to think about this recently where I came to the realisation that I still crave the fame and popularity that I didnt get in school.

I don't want to forgive them, and I swear I prefer suffering during my entire life about it than forgiving. Sorry for the rant.",t3_9xf7bw
e9tjj8h,t3_9xf7bw,"So, I was bullied heavily for 6 years in secondary school (Germany), both physically and psychologically. The beat me, spat at me, yelled at me in groups, made it their game to make me cry. Those years were absolute HELL.

But I would actually say, that it made me stronger, in some ways. Not necessarily having a thicker skin, mind you! I think it made me all the more sensitive and especially, empathetic. I very quickly cop on when something's up with someone. I can, somehow, feel it. I'm not very good when it comes to words of comfort, because I never got them... but I'm good at giving company and hugs (proven). I don't want to sound full of myself but I think I'm a very good friend to have. Not sure if I'd be the same kind of friend if all this hadn't happened.

I also think, the whole experience made me more brave, adventurous and curious. When I finished school, I went abroad for a year. After that I studied abroad for 3 years and now live far away from my home town. Being bullied for so long made me realise that those ties to home that matter, will persist even when I'm gone. And that made it very easy to jump into the deep end and start over.Up to a point where I actually think, I want to start over again! It's exhilarating!

&#x200B;

so yes, being bullied made me stronger. Not in the conventional way though.

But I don't think this can be generalised. Those great experiences I've had afterwards definitely had their part in me being stronger. It took a long time to get over my experience and sometimes they still hit me. Someone who maybe didn't get to change their lives so drastically like I did, might not be stronger or at least feel stronger. every case is different.",t3_9xf7bw

Of course it is about power. It is an attempt, where everything goes, by kids to create a hierarchy in the absence of adults. 

&#x200B;

>Yeah, it¬¥s possible, eg.¬† experience of bullying develops your cognitive ability for forgiveness (Egan & Todorov, 2009).

I haven't read the paper, but for forgiveness to happen, the ones who have done you wrong have to  admit, regret that they hurt you and then ask for forgiveness. Anything else is just coping with the pain. 

&#x200B;

>How would your life look if you would be raised in over-protecting social structure where you never have to copy with any social problems whatsoever? 

Your definition of over-protection seems like not being sent everyday to the arena of a roman circus. Bully victims don't cope with social problems, they are just the punching bags where everybody gets rid of their frustrations. After a while you don't even feel human. 

&#x200B;

> *Do you think being a bully victim made you stronger (/better) person? How?*

What being a bullying victim gave me......? First of all it made me quite cynical about human beings. It taught me that people are like sharks, you can swim with them, even play with them, but as soon as you start bleeding they turn on you. Right now I manage to recover a lot since the end of High School, I go out and have friends. But during my worst days, people would attack me or avoid me like I was a leprous, it is very difficult to get out of that position. 

It also gave me a ""sixth sense"" about people, I can intuitively pick up if the person is abusive, fake or genuinely a good person. 

It also pushed me out of my comfort zone to seek ways to undo the damage, I am in therapy, but also went to all kinds of alternative therapies, with little success. What best worked for me is therapy and  zen meditation. It also draw me closer to my religion (Catholicism), I started seeing that there is a great deal of wisdom, despite the dogmas that are for me hard to believe.  

After years of working on myself, I somehow managed to developed a leader personality, I sometimes get pushed by the group into that position, which because of my personal history feels quite awkward to me.

Girls absolutely hated me and made sure I knew that at every turn, excluding me, playing mind games and stealing my lunch. Girls and boys alike sexually harassed me. My days were full of huffs, eye rolls, and tripping feet. Having felt very alone and having had no choice but to be my own rock, I think it did give me a thicker skin and a solemn awareness of how I am to be treated, so in a way it did make me stronger. Having felt such heaviness, such hopelessness, such fear at a young age, I would never want to subject anybody to those same feelings and thus never became a bully while simultaneously building a stronger sense of empathy and caring for others.

While he was a very brutal person, that loved brawls and domination, he came from a background that was really harsh to him.

It only shows that i - a very thin child - had not the slightest chance against this brute. ""Hit back"" was the stupidest advice anyone could give. I currently feel so much anger, even thinking about this laconic comments, i would love to hit something.

This brings me to the other side of the bullying - the betraya from everyone who didn't protect me was far more bad in the end. From the little girls giggling while i received a beating to other classmates just watching or laughing. From the teachers who told me ""life is no picnic"" to my parents who just told me to ""hit back"", but never got their asses up to talk to our school. In my eyes it was this unhealthy mix of malice, neglectance and ignorance, that really messed me up. It made me feel very alone and hate most people in general.

It gave me a deep distrust in society and mankind in general and hate some types of persons, especially on a subliminal level. Hate that makes me do and feel strange things.

This isn't how you put it initially, with

>eg.¬† experience of bullying develops your cognitive ability for forgiveness (Egan & Todorov, 2009)

Guitar playing develops scabs on your skin where you push the strings. It is a direct result of guitar playing. Forgiveness, as a tool offered, is not a direct result of bullying.

As for considering forgiveness as a shield, from what I could gather it is discussed as a means to prevent the victmization of other people by the person being victimized. It isn't discussed as a protective mechanism for the victim really, and I do not believe it can be. Forgiveness means letting go of the anger of the person that wronged you.

In a hypothetical bullying situation that is ongoing, how would that protect a victim? Let's say it is insulted and shoved in a locker one day, it goes home and forgives the attackers. What about the situation has changed, aside from the victim letting go of the anger it holds towards the persons that abused it? The victim was still hummiliated, hurt, assaulted and abused.

Given as isolated advice, forgiveness rather has the potential to increase the trauma dealt to the victim. If all you do is forgive the people that repeatedly attack you, your implicit position in the world is clear: You are a punching bag. You are an abuse victim. You deserve what they give you, since your only allowed initiative in this situation is to stop being angry at the people who abuse you. Given how it is implicit to forgiveness that being angry is wrong, the victim is even further pushed down that path, since the message in that case is ""your natural response to abuse is wrong."" The direct implication of that for the victim is, that it is naturally faulty.

Therefore, forgiveness isn't a shield. It may be vital to complete recovery after the bullying has ended, if the victim is still holding on to anger and hatred for it's abusers, that impairs the victims quality of life. But when the situation is ongoing? I don't see the point, aside to maybe prevent the victim lashing out at others.

But if the biggest concern in that situation is to isolate the victimization to one person, than that is pretty fucked up.

&#x200B;

>Here is very provocative question for you. Do you think forgiveness for those who abused or bullied you would make situation actually better?

I have forgiven everyone that abused me. I do not hold grudges. Did it do anything for me? Barely. The investment of anger into the perpetrators is negligible considering the damage otherwise suffered.

It does things for them, tho. I am not considering revenge in any form, which means they remain happy and healthy. And alive.

I don't see forgiveness to do anything, aside from, as discussed, breaking an assumed ""cycle of violence"".

An allegory: Someone shoots you in the gut with a shotgun. No matter how much you forgive the man that did that, it doesn't change the fact you will be shitting in a bag for the forseeable future. It only stops you from going to his house the next chance you get and blasting his nuts off.

ea2u27z,t1_ea0yid1,"As hurtful as the experience was, it's dangerous to allow the experience to manifest that deeply into your psyche as it will ultimately affect the quality of your life. After my experience with bullying, like you, I became very angry and ultimately shut a lot of people out - the wrong people out. I regret this, deeply. In the end, it's really an absurd cycle ---> pushing everyone away b/c you don't want to get hurt ---> yet still hurting deeply inside, accomplishing nothing but more pain for yourself as you mentally and socially cripple yourself further.

As a past victim of both bullying and domestic physical abuse, I truly get how crippling the experiences of targeted abuse can be. 

Which is why I truly believe that you can not feed and give those experiences *power*. While you can't always control being's someone's target and enduring abuse, you *can* control how you choose to respond to it, though it takes a level of awareness and the ability to reframe. 

In therapy, sometimes it can help to go back to the experience and *rewrite/react* in way, in which you take emotional control and don't give the bully (&/or any supporting individuals) power and respond in a healthy/positive and confident way. It will feel unnatural and bizarre, but it's amazing how humor and positively (maintaining your inner light) can greatly diffuse even some of the darkest situations.

It's important to ask yourself: Is this emotion/thought/behavior hurting or helping me towards the person that I want to be/the future that I want for myself?

Everyday, you ultimately make choice and that choice affects your self-growth or descent. 

Reset/rewire your psyche - take control of your life :) - I can't tell how amazing the road ahead will be, when you do.

- You owe it to yourself to understand and investigate more of that *why*. When you truly start understanding human behavior, it will be a lot easier to navigate neg/traumatic social situations and potentially limit these from occurring repeatedly. Take some time to identify patterns and get to the general root. 

It's interesting what we *normalize, justify,accept as comfortable*. If you're truly simply an introvert and feel content in your own space, then by all means, embrace it. But you if you have extroverted qualities and needs, but simply repress them due to social anxiety, then there's likely a part of you that is being left unfulfilled. 

*Why should i train hard to embrace social contacts if avoiding them makes me feel happy without any emotional roller-coasters?*

- By all means, if you truly feel *happy*, then I see no point in challenging you on that notion. However, I feel that we can often blindly over-justify in light of inner *fear/discomfort* w/ past trauma/situations ---> it's that tunnel vision that prevents us from giving *future people/possible companions* a chance to be introduced to our lives. Most research has shown people that have personal *quality* social relationships are often the happier in life compared to those that lack none.

*does training to behave differently not mean that ""it was your fault because you should have acted differently""?*

- As for the victims fault: imo, not *necessarily*, as *anyone* can be a target for bullying. I think targeted abuse can range depending on the Bully/Bully's Agenda/Victim/Situation. I've met with a range of individuals from various backgrounds and social rankings that  have been bullied in their life.

eaarc9r,t1_eaamgyh,"*What i really can't stand is boredom. I get restless like crazy and look for things to do.*
- Honestly, why don't you shake up/challenge your reality a bit and do something that challenges you? There's no reason to be bored when you have the time and money to be actively exploring or engaging in something interesting and/or new.

- My favorite quote is: ""Run from what's comfortable""- Rumi. Living by this philosophy has allowed me to challenge my fears and pursue my dreams. By challenging myself, I've ultimately have found myself and have experienced such extreme levels of happiness and wellbeing that I never dreamed fathomable.  Honestly: challenge/dare yourself - do something ""uncomfortable"" or even a little bizarre.

*It's more like a very strong inner voice/urge that needs to be satisfied. Maybe talking to someone would help. But to get what?*
- My philosophy: *Investigate Everything*. Investigate that inner voice. Allow yourself to drawn by anything that inspires you or sparks curiosity/interests.

*And i also don't actively want it. I'm a bit afraid what happens when i get older, though.*

-""You never know what you never know"" - my most meaningful and life-enhancing journeys have been made possible by me embracing and having the resiliency to face all that can result from doing something ""risky/challenging/uncomfortable"". I feel that the most powerful avenues towards true fulfillment involves: self exploration/investigation, a level of bravery and resiliency to embrace the unknown and the discomfort that comes from it. 

*Maybe talking to someone would help. But to get what?*
- Honestly, finding a good therapist or even a good friend can be like finding gold ... but can be a great experience once you're able to engage in healthy exchanges. When you find someone that you genuinely connect with, perhaps gently open yourself up to and ask for guidance.
- How one most effectively heals, I feel can range from person to person. But it's worth exploring approaches to healing and or self discovery if you feel or suspect a void inside of you.

- My style can be a bit more radical than most, but it breaks the dangerous overprotective and auto emotional reward-seeking cycles that keep us blindly limited and unfulfilled in our narrow comfort zones/comfortable prisons.

- Again, I only speak from my personal experience. Why don't you start with simple project/investigation and ask your friends and coworkers: Of your journey thus far, what lessons have you learned about happiness and achieving fulfillment in life?",t3_9xf7bw

e9h3mug,t3_9vyfnh,"What exactly are they doing to him, and what does he tell himself to think he doesn't get bullied? And is he showing signs that the bullying affects him, like depression, anxiety etc.? 

In general, be there for him, never judge him, never blame him. It's important that he can open up to you. Don't act over his head and go to teachers or threaten his bullies. Without him wanting that, you can make things worse, because when he is not ready to resist, you lack information about what is happening, because he surely won't tell you. 

When he is ready, start with informing teachers and principal about what is happening, and maybe go with your brother to a martial arts gym (cool stuff, like boxing, muay thai or MMA, not that asia-bs that has been watered down in the cultural revolution and by McDojos afterwards). Small guys can do a lot of damage when they set their mind to it. If you think he is ready to fight back, read up on your local self defense laws, because it's important for him to act within them. Schools with no violence policies have no qualms about calling the cops, and bullies act in groups. That means you don't want them to be able to claim under oath that he attacked first. When it goes to the police, it's important that he does not make any statement without a lawyer.",t3_9vyfnh

It was so humiliating and frustrating that I was being bullied and I have very little power to do about it. There are this manly thing among men and being not able to stand up to bullies was a sin of cowardism according to that.

I thought it was 'snitching' to tell some about bullying only when bullies are not around. I thought in order to tell someone about bullying and not be a snitch, I should stand up to bully face to face.

Right now, you have a lunatic bitch calling around in your friend circle to get you ostracized. So what you do is, you call up the people she called.

Tell your friends to get into contact with your other friends to ask them, if she called them, too.

Your former friend can only make allegations against you, while you have proof of her negative behavior.

As for the girl in your class. Confront her. Explain her, honestly and calmly, what you have been through, why you have trust issues with people, and that you certainly do not victmize yourself.

e85vuck,t3_9q173a,"I hate that you have to go through this. It makes going to a job a dreaded event.

I have a technique that might help. The bully is trying to get a reaction out of you in some cases, and in others is just trying to dump on you unfairly. In all cases, I‚Äôd recommend pretending that you‚Äôre aren‚Äôt listening and then saying, ‚ÄúHuh, were you talking to me? Sorry, I was concentrating on (fill in the blank here). Did you need something?‚Äù Chances are they won‚Äôt repeat it all a second time.

If the bully gets in your face directly with their comment, wait a moment, cock your head slightly to the side empathetically like you‚Äôre watching a five year old trying to use big words, and respond with a non-sequitur (in a low and completely non-sarcastic voice) such as:

‚ÄúMmm hmmm...‚Äù

‚ÄúGosh...‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodness...‚Äù

‚ÄúWow...‚Äù

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think so?‚Äù

And then redirect to another issue, ‚ÄúSo, about Table Six, could you please make sure they have...?‚Äù Or any other request to get them back on track.

Bullies will gravitate towards easier targets, so if you withhold a reaction, they‚Äôll likely go elsewhere.

In regards to the boss, I‚Äôd recommend framing the complaint as ‚Äúxxx doesn‚Äôt seem very happy at work lately‚Äîif there‚Äôs anything I can do to help, would you please let me know?‚Äù That way you‚Äôre offering to be a part of a solution up front and not putting the boss on the spot with a demand to do something. And lastly, and this sucks, be prepared to leave the job (or request a shift change, saying it‚Äôs because of school) if it doesn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs definitely not your fault and it‚Äôs not fair that you should have to leave should it come to that, but sometimes bullies have a stranglehold on their jobs, will unfairly play the protected class (gender/race/disability/marital status /etc.) card with management to scare them, and as such, aren‚Äôt so easily to get rid of.

*The Bully at Work* by Dr. Gary Namie of the Workplace Bullying Institute is also recommended.

e76ewdj,t3_9lf0tn,"Bullying has forced me a lot of introspection, here are some of my conclusions. Truth is you cannot choose what you want to feel, it is almost organic. If I break your leg, it is going to hurt, no matter what you wish or do.  Having said that....

Don't worry about ""getting revenge"", it won't undo the damage done. You'll feel a bit better for a short time, but it won't change the anger inside. Life (or karma) will take care of them.  One of my main bullies abused drugs after HS, he turned into a dimwitted, peace&love hippie. He used to be very smart and mean. I could in theory harm that pathetic hippie, but there wouldn't be any challenge nor merit in doing so. Life has punished him more than I ever could have.

About the hatred (or anger). To deal with it, I started practicing karate intensively and hit the gym.  I also sit zazen every morning. I didn't get rid of my  anger, it became part of my personality, it is in a position where it doesn't burden me.  (Don't know if this makes sense, but this is my way of coping with it. )

e7h3qcg,t3_9lf0tn,"Ever read/see ""the shack"" ? Amazing even if you aren't religious. 
Best advice I've ever heard on this subject. It goes something like this. Say ""I forgive you"" as many times as you need and as often as you need. Every time you feel that hatred. Even if you don't mean it. Say it. Eventually, you'll start to mean it and slowly but surely the hate will dwindle. And forgiveness will creep in. 

Forgiving someone for something big doesn't happen all at once. It's a process. Hope this helps. Much love.",t3_9lf0tn

This dark cloud will affect every future relationship that you have in life (including a spouse and future children). It may have already impacted your trust of friends now. It will be difficult, but the only way to get rid of the black cloud is to realize that immaturity (basically, being a kid) will cause people to do and say the dumbest things that are always regretted later. This girl may or may not feel regret right now, but, I promise that she eventually will. If life is a school, then her lessons are coming. She may even cry herself to sleep one night (as a future mom) thinking about how she treated you..who knows? You are still young, so it's hard to have perspective of the bigger picture.

I had a shitty manager, who was always rude, neglected providing support, and liked to stick with her clique only in conducting business in a setting where a manager backup was in constant demand by the whole team. As I was leaving, we all got called by a corporate investigator to be interviewed about her behavior. I stated the time she was rude to me, because that is all I had, I never complained on her, but someone did.  Rude people are just assholes, I just ignored her and did my job. She was fired, there was actually a fair amount of evidence in emails against her and like 20 people came out against her for her attitude. She was also of African descent and a woman, maybe it wasn't seen as a race thing because her boss, the VP over us (I wish I could say her name here because she tried to defraud 100s of BofA customers facing foreclosures and deserves to always be outed)  also was of African descent and a woman, and about half the managers were of African descent.

&#x200B;

I would think of any times that may be brought up by your co-workers. I would bet that someone besides just this manager said something, it could have just been a report saying hello and you being busy, thinking of a task at hand forgot to respond at all or forgot an email, etc. These things can be small, maybe they are all small things that individually don't mean anything, but someone may have decided that all of them combined makes you unfit for the job.

As a manager, he violated my confidentiality and undermined any legitimate grievance he may have had by announcing what he did to my team. If I had done something wrong, why didn't he give me a fair chance to defend myself before coming to a judgement prematurely. As I said he had only been in the role for days and it sounds like his mind was already made up.",t3_9hdl1p

Being who I am, I ignored these feeling and sunk deeper (I didn't seek help either). Some people don't see that this feeling is having them choose the wrong path. Instead of reaching for help, they reach to pull others down. 

He most likely is sorry if he contacted you. Let him know how much that time in your life hurt maybe. It may give him an opening to explain what he was feeling that had him choosing to do that to you. 

No one is born evil, mean, happy, sad, whatever. We learn it. There are factors that can help us in one direction or the other, but we always have a choice. It's just difficult for some to choose correctly.

While I was bullied, nobody fucking cared. Teachers looked away, even told me off when I complained, parents were apathetic to it, my ""friends"" also did nothing to defend me.

Only years after when my life fell apart and I couldn't hide behind the pretense of being a ""manly man"" (and nothing against that, as long as its healthy) anymore, I had to face down the consequenses of my bullying.

you really think this is the best way to handle this?

What is going on at school that he doesn't have friends? For example, my daughter didn't make many friends when she went to a new school, she told me it was the other kids. She even told me they bullied her, she even got visibly upset, not saying this is the case with your brother, but I was 100% convinced at first of bullying.

I investigated with the school, the teachers, etc. Turns out she was being a little playground boss and kids didn't like that, and other times she only wanted to talk to teachers at recess. We all started coaching her on not being a little dictator, and also not following the teachers around and now she has friends, a crush and doesn't say anything negative about kids.

Sometimes what we think is going on actually isn't and sometimes it needs help from others. It wasn't just me coaching her, it took the principal, counselor, her teacher too.

And I know the feelings of regret you get when looking back. Right now we are seeing tons of options, what we could have done back then. I know that I repeatedly went to my abusers to talk to them, to see if I could defuse it, and I was beaten up for it, and still I tried again and again.

dygfzue,t3_8gmqx4,"1. Stop trying so hard 
2. Hold your head high

I assume you want to find new friends, but whether you do or not, DON'T walk around looking lonely and defeated no matter how you really feel. Communicate with other people when the situation calls for it, and do it confidently. 
Leave before other people start wanting you to leave, and be there only when you really want to be (not when you feel like it's 'your only chance').
Even if people don't like you, they can respect you enough to leave well enough alone.
I never had 'real' friends throughout school and was lonely, but I interacted with enough confidence to distract from the loneliness, and conducted myself in a just slightly aloof way that meant any attempt to bully me simply failed until they stopped trying. 

The long story of why I'm giving you this advice:
When I started secondary school at 11 I settled in with the expected group of friends. By the time I was 12 it was becoming clear that I simply didn't quite fit in and they began to 'softly' bully me. Move my bag to the edges of the group when I went to get lunch; Jump on opportunities to gang up on me when I did something wrong; leave me out of group assignments. So I did what was probably a strangely mature thing for a 12 year-old and left. I just decided that I wasn't going to be treated like that and I MADE THE DECISION. That's the important part, ok? I didn't let them chase me off - I walked away and didn't look back.

Unfortunately I then chose another group of friends it turned out that I didn't quite fit in with. So by your age I was in a position where rather than outright bully me, I just... Wasn't important. No one invited me out; no one would choose me if we had to form pairs; no one would take my side if I was upset about something. So by the time I was 14 it all got a bit dramatic and I told them they were horrible friends and once again just left.

And then I floated for a few years developing exactly the attitude I'm telling you to develop. 
It helps that I'm intelligent and and socially aware. I knew when I was being baited and could just look unimpressed, and I was able to pull of a subtle air of 'better than you' when I needed to. 
I learned to shake off embarrassment (or at least hide it), and to speak very frankly. I say what I mean, and I mean what I say. It also forced me to develop a pretty quick and biting sense of humour.

So that by the time I was 16 and a girl in a class decided that she didn't like my manners (after overhearing an insult being hurled, not knowing that myself and the other girl were friendly and just messing around), I tolerated her for a few weeks, but eventually simply told her to 'Shut up. I don't like you. Stop talking to me'. And you know what? My reputation preceded me and that girl never spoke to me again when she didn't have to for the 2/3 years of school that remained.

Listen. This isn't a depressing 'you're a loner now'. This is me telling you how to maintain your self respect. Because this is going to scar you. You can't be treated like this and pretend it never happened. It is happening and it's going to be part of what shapes you as a person. One day you'll leave that school and have a fresh start like I eventually did. You'll know who would make a good friend and avoid bad choices, and most importantly you'll already know how to carry yourself.
I'm still insecure in some ways. I have 'real' friends now, but sometimes I struggle to trust them. Sometimes I suspect that they don't want me anymore than anyone else did, even though right now I have the most solid friendships I ever have.
But at the very least the only person who gets to make me feel insecure is ME.
Your self respect is what matters the most here, ok? For the love of everything - do NOT lose your self respect.",t3_8gmqx4

Your daughter's response sounds hurtful as well, calling that girl's life ""pitiful"" and ""rather cut my throat"" if your daughter were to be like her. Basically attacking her and her beliefs. And you as a parent have basically attacked another parent's child by calling her names such as ""judgmental BITCH."" It's kind of sad that you as PARENT attacked another CHILD like that.

cps385s,t3_30dynj,"That's horrible.  :(  I was bullied at that age by girls who I thought were originally friends.
 
My own daughter is only 8 and the things we've had to deal with have been of a different nature (a troubled boy liked her and tried to threaten her into a ""friendship"").  Things I suggest you do:
 
1) Keep a log. You don't want your daughter obsessing about everything, but you need to track the behavior by these individuals.  Every day, as part of the ""getting home ceremony"" of your lives, you or your wife need to just check in with her and ask about those specific girls.  Did they do anything to her and did they do anything to anyone else.  Then document the day, approximate time or class period, what happened, who was there, did a teacher know and if so what did they do.  I kept a spreadsheet.
 
2) Communicate anything out of the ordinary with the teacher, and if possible, do so over email so you and the school district have a record.  Now it sounds like your teacher is on the ball since she contacted you, but it doesn't hurt to still keep a paper trail.  Especially if you are getting stonewalled further down the line by administrators or other folk.
 
3) Any kind of physical threat should be taken seriously (kudos again to your teacher) and should result in a meeting.  The kid who drew it should be disciplined in some way.  It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with your school districts discipline policy. I dug around our school districts website, found the handbook, and then found the discipline policy that mandates particular punishments or actions depending on what the kid did.  Know this because it's kinda like your rights or your contract.  If a kid is threatening your kid, you know what the standard is for discipline. 
 
4) If the teacher doesn't follow the stated discipline policy, then be prepared to go first to the administrators (principal and assistant principal), and then if they don't help, consider outlets like the superintendent and the school board (especially when they have public meetings). Were this to not work, then you have to go ""public"" and try and find a news agency who wants to take up your plight.  Now hopefully your situation will stay small and you won't have to go above the teacher. But, kids can get nasty, parents can get nasty, and administrators can get numb. And in that case, that's when you have to start embarrassing people.  I know this because my parents were both teachers and my father was a member of the school board for a very large district.  We'd often gets calls at 5am with complaints from parents.  It makes an impact.
 
5) Above all, as a former bullied kid, validate her feelings.  Don't just tell your child cop out comments like ""They're just jealous of you"". That's literally the joke of my generation. Many bullies have high self esteem and they do it because they feel they can. Tell your daughter that some people, especially at her age when puberty hormones make everyone go a little crazy, can have a nasty ugliness inside.  And they take those feelings and decide to hurt others with them. Often they just select their ""victim"" as a matter of luck or proximity.  She was nearby, they saw her on a bad day, or they knew her well enough to know that she wouldn't attack them. 
 
The important thing, I think, is that she doesn't see herself as an eternal victim.  Just as someone who had the unfortunate luck of crossing paths with someone when they went ugly.  There is nothing wrong with your daughter. She is awesome and she needs to know it. But now is the time that chance chose for her to be introduced to the world of other people's ugly behavior.
 
She also needs to feel safe at school.  And with all the school shootings in the news, that is something for you to bring up whenever you are meeting with teachers or administrators. Say the words that your daughter ""needs to feel safe in school"". In the situation with my daughter, in the post Columbine age, I learned that is a magic phrase. Because if a school gets a reputation for not being ""safe"", parents will transfer away and money will be lost. When I started using that phrase, suddenly everyone was extremely helpful.
 
Teach your daughter to tell her teacher whenever the girls start up on her.  And yes, they are likely to turn it up when she tells on them and call her names for doing so. But that only increases your paper trail and the teacher's responsibility for the situation.  They know you're keeping track, then they're going to be motivated to do the right thing. You need to keep a very open dialogue with your daughter. Her not telling the teacher protects the bullies from discipline. Her not telling you allows the school staff to look the other way if it doesn't ""look too serious"". Everyone staying in communication keeps it up in the air.
 
I hope that helps.",t3_30dynj

Here's my advice. Every time he says something just remind yourself that you're changing yourself for the better, and for yourself. He is doing fuck all but trying to pull you down because he's insecure about himself and he's projecting that onto you. Any time he calls you a fat bitch, what he's saying is ""I don't want you to be fitter than me."" When he calls you obese he's saying ""I don't want you to lose weight so I end up the overweight one."" He's trying to pull you down so he can still feel superior. The best thing you can do is continue to piss him off by losing the weight, then when you're on your target and he calls you fat or obese, just laugh at him and tell him that you're actually smack bang in the healthy weight zone and to stop acting like a spoilt child.

There's a guy who went to my high school who was a bully. It's been almost a decade since high school and the past few years he's been getting drunk at bars in the area almost every night. If he sees someone from school he will approach them and outline like everything awful he did and will apologize, we call it his Apology Olympics because of how many people he's tried this with. For a frame of reference in school he was anti-Semitic, violent, misogynistic, mean, creepy, and liked people to think he was edgy/scary. When me and my friends see him at the bars, we avoid him.

Once we talk it out, I would finally slap them as hard as possible and explain that hurt out of nowhere is how it felt when they first started bullying me or when I deluded myself into thinking they were done with me.

I think many bully victims who reach this point cross this hurdle.  You reach a point where you can forgive then may even say you have and yet you are still on that bridge, not yet fully willing to let go.  Why, because your frustrated, you got no ending to the story, no finality.  I've been there too.  In reality though at some point, you learn it really doesn't matter what they have.  Like anyone else you don't know what they have in life really doesn't matter.  The only real reason why this person effects you so is because you give them that power due to the past.  

In reality, their life has no real bearing on yours.  Dude could have 50 yachts and unless he runs you over one day it's of no real consequence to you.  Your life is your own to shape and so far you have been doing a good job, so don't let the idea of this guy get in your way.

I agree: make contact. If you can email the teacher directly, great. If not, you can at least inform the school system of your horrible experiences with the teacher.

I spent most of last year contacting past bullies. Responses varied, but I have the satisfaction of knowing I finally confronted them after all these years.

Good luck to you and please let me know how it goes.",t3_gvaqzi

ft830z3,t1_ft7l3i2,"Hi, /u/in-a-mid-life-crisis. Thanks for reading. So she wasn't a teacher, but a school staff member. I don't know what her title was, but she literally watched us while we were eating in the cafeteria (and she may have watched us during recess, but my memories are vague). And no, she wasn't the cafeteria ""lady."" She didn't cook or serve the food in the cafeteria; she just watched students while they were eating breakfast. I don't know how old she was in 1995 or if she'd even still be working there now (not very likely), which is why I'm not sure who or how to reach out. This is why records of her might not be as definitive since she wasn't an actual teacher. 
Should I email my elementary school's current principal? Should I email the superintendent? I grew up in a large California city and my school district had over 95 elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools in total. Should I email the assistant superintendent of elementary schools? Should I email everyone of these people at the same time, in the same email?",t3_gvaqzi
fspdlk8,t1_fsp44ka,Hey ma'am no problem. I'd do the same thing.,t3_gvaqzi
ft8gj9c,t1_ft830z3,"I didn‚Äôt know she wasn‚Äôt a teacher. When I grew up, teachers doubled as monitors during lunch time and recess.

1995 was 25 years ago, so finding a good place to start is going to be tricky, for sure.

First: Are you friends with or still in contact with anyone (classmates) from that time? Perhaps they remember this woman? Do you know is she harassed/bullied any other children? If so, contacting the other victims is a good place to start.

Second: As you were searching the school directories, did you come across any teachers or principals you had during that time? If so, I would start with them as they may remember you. Even though they may not know or remember the woman who gave you such a hard time, it‚Äôll still give you an outlet to vent your grievances. Be prepared though... it‚Äôs been 25 years and you may discover that many of your teachers are no longer employed by the school system. Maybe some of them have retired, moved, took other employment or passed away since.

Third; Don‚Äôt be surprised to if you don‚Äôt receive a response. Schools generally like to sweep bullying under the rug. I know this from experience. My chief bully works as a third grade teacher in a nearby school system. He absolutely refuses to acknowledge me, and the school system he works for blocked me on Facebook. I just want to warn you to be prepared for the outcome. It may not be the one you want, and you could end up causing yourself much pain and grief.

Me? It was hard. I had people completely ignore me, block me, deny their actions and was even told by one to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù.

Do I regret it? Absolutely not. 

I did have two people apologize to me which was nice, but I didn‚Äôt need their apologies. I just needed to let them know how they made me feel back then and how it affected me both then and now.

If you‚Äôre unable to find anyone from that time, I would email the superintendent. Be cordial. There‚Äôs no need to be confrontational. Just compose yourself and articulate what your experiences were and try to convey the impact it has had on you.

Again, keep me posted and good luck!",t3_gvaqzi
fta8n89,t1_ft8gj9c,"Thanks for this. I don't keep in contact with my elementary school friends or classmates. I'm Facebook friends with a few, but barely talk to them so I feel awkward emailing them with this random question. Also, at least one of them announced his father passed away recently so I don't want to bother him. 

There is one teacher I had who is still teaching there (according to the school's website), but I doubt she'd remember me. It's been 25 years and she's had so many students since then. 

I think my best bet is to email the superintendent, but I feel like it is a bit extreme... 

Thank you for sharing your own experience with reaching out to people. I'm so sorry to hear that some denied their actions toward you and some told you to move on. The latter is what I'm most afraid of when contacting the superintendent, because they might think there's nothing they can do now and that what happened to me was not physical abuse. Of course, I'd argue that I was only 10 and a child; I didn't know what was happening to me at the time. :/ 

Thanks again for listening and for your advice. I'll probably draft an email to the superintendent about whether he'd want to hear about bullying that happened to me in 1995, without going into detail, just to gauge his interest.",t3_gvaqzi
ftag41n,t1_fta8n89,"You‚Äôre very welcome! :)

I understand your reservations regarding contacting your friends (or people you knew) back then. I actually used one of my friends to contact a former bully on Facebook. The bully actually popped up as a ‚ÄúFriend Suggestion/People You May Know‚Äù feed and my friend was a mutual friend. I felt bad about it afterwards because he didn‚Äôt know why I was asking him to let the other guy know I messaged him. I wanted to make sure he checked his filtered messages to make sure he read it. I tried messaging someone else who was also a mutual friend and I asked him to get a hold of that person for me as well. He never responded. It was then I knew he realized what I was doing. I messaged him and apologized profusely for getting him in the middle. I even invited him out for coffee and he graciously accepted. He is a wonderful human being and what I did, using him to get to my bullies, was absolutely wrong.

You‚Äôd be surprised; that teacher may remember you. If not, you may still feel some sort of connection and maybe will feel comfortable enough to share your experiences with him/her. I‚Äôd like to think that most people are decent and empathetic and will generally help someone seeking it. The teacher obviously can‚Äôt do anything about the harassment. That was 25 years ago and no one can undo the past. But, he/she might be able to provide you with some support. If not, at least you unburdened yourself.

My therapist had me write a letter to the bully (who harassed me every single day), but not to send it. I read it at one of our sessions. You could try that. Write a letter to this woman, and tell her how she made you feel back then and how it has affected you, even to this day.

Like I said, I have no regrets for trying to contact my bullies (other than using a friend to do so).

I think I got to the point that I just didn‚Äôt care anymore. They didn‚Äôt like me then, so why would I care if they like me now?

It‚Äôs hard to let go of the past. Our past shape our future.

Whatever you decide to do, I wish you the best of luck and I sincerely hope you find what you‚Äôre needing.

 I‚Äôm here for moral support, so please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out.

As always, best regards and please let me know how everything goes. :)",t3_gvaqzi

fhph6ew,t3_f1nvnz,"Before I give my thoughts, I want to share a small relatable story:

Man, I know how you feel. I've been there and gone through this very similar to your story; at my first job,  my cohorts would call me stupid because I had difficulty finding the rooms to work and have sessions/meetings. It was a very large building, so it would be easy to get lost. After I got used to the location, They would still joke about me being lost non-stop. It was their hobby, very disgusting. Luckily, it was a temporary job to gain experience so i would count down the days left till I'm free.









I would confront them and tell them to cut it out, no human on this earth is perfect and mistakes happen all the time. Tell them you need to be respected just like every other person working at the job. Our goal is to work together and help one another, not ruin each other. As far as perormance, do what you can to provide the best work possible. Mistakes are inevitable and unpredictable. If they persist, I would leave the workplace. Toxic environments in the workplace shouldn't be tolerated and is bad for one's mental health. You can speak to your family members as well to support you through this. All the best man. You're not alone.  üëä",t3_f1nvnz

fa1s1h1,t3_e78lyc,"First off. You need to settle down and get ahold of your self. No one is going to kill you or anyone else for that matter. I am a grown adult, and I grew up with Tourettes, OCD, and ADHD myself. Only I was undiagnosed at the time. First, I can tell that you are really lacking in self confidence. I will address that in a minute. The very first thing you need to do is to talk to your parents. Remember, they are there to help and protect you. Tell them what is going on. Then try to come up with a plan for protecting you. The second thing you need to do is to try to start building your self confidence up. This is the number one thing that can help you to avoid becoming a target of bullies. Actually, now that I think about it. You really need to get your parents to buy the book that I just recently published. The title is ""My Do's and Don't's for Raising a Bully-Proof Child."" You can find it on my website at http://bullyingdosanddonts.com . The information in this book will help both you and your parents. It will help them to learn how to help you. My email address is in the book. So if you need to contact me you can do so.",t3_e78lyc
fa2zvni,t3_e78lyc,"I know how it feels. I‚Äôm a year older than you and I have ADHD. I felt almost exactly the same at this time last year. I wanted to school choice out. Then later on I realized that it was partially me, and when it wasn‚Äôt, those people didn‚Äôt matter.

If it‚Äôs happening in a class, tell a teacher and tell them not to tell the office. Remind them that if the bully/bullies go down, you go down with them. I did this in my Psychology class recently. Now my teacher is watching out for it and making sure it doesn‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs been all good since. Pm me if you want man I‚Äôm here.",t3_e78lyc

Generally speaking most other kids with adhd often have issues socializing with other people and it usually because of hyperactivity and other symptoms of adhd try to look up ways to control hyperactivity and work on social cues and socializing along with talking to your guidance counselor about working on your hyperactivity and other symptoms and social skills also do not be afraid to fight  back against  these people if they lay there hands on you mate I was in the same situation.also some adhd drugs may help if it gets bad",t3_e78lyc

That‚Äôs what I did when my friends tried playing Alpha Male.",t3_dt2s0v

But if you‚Äôre not wanting to just drop them altogether, you could also just not respond to them until they say your actual name. Another option could be to try coming up with extremely personal and degrading nicknames for them about things you know they are really sensitive/self-conscious about (parents going through a divorce, bad acne, GF cheated on them, etc.) and not stop using it until they stop with theirs. It won‚Äôt wake them up unless it hits so close to home that it actually hurts. I don‚Äôt know if I would recommend this one, but it definitely could be effective (as long as the nickname is personal and hurtful enough). It‚Äôs probably best to avoid physical confrontation, but giving them a taste of their own medicine could be what us needed here. If they say they don‚Äôt speak rat, you could say you don‚Äôt speak marriage-ruiner or whatever you have decided will hit them like a truck. However, at the end of the day, I urge you to consider if these are really the friends you want to have in life. Do you feel emotionally comfortable around them? Are you a better person because of them? They don‚Äôt seem to be actual friends that want the best for you.

Id do it with a straight face and while maintaining eye contact, to assert dominance.

But im also probably a bit older than you, and already known to be a weirdo by my friends. 

.

Seriously though just keep letting them know you don't like it. Sometimes even good friends can be dense and don't realize how annoying they are until you point it out a couple times.

Therapy is a great idea! It may take a bit for him to open up though. This has probably been a very traumatic experience for him and his emotions about it and how he sees himself right now are probably all mixed up. I would say that if there are any other schools in the area perhaps he could do school choice (your parents would fill out some forms that would allow him to attend a school outside of his home district). Your parents could look into homeschooling if they feel that both he and they can commit to something like that. Most of all though he just needs to be supported and know that this literally has absolutely nothing to do with him. 
A lot of what you said in your post reminds me of the small town I grew up in. Ignorant people breeding ignorance.... it‚Äôs sad. 
Hope things get better!",t3_dq52q4

f5tydwj,t3_dpahmy,"Yes you are being bullied and no it is not your fault. 

Bullies get their self esteem from belittling and degrading their targets. To justify it to themselves they blame their target by saying their annoying. 

I‚Äôm sorry that you are going through that, it sounds horrible. The behavior is probably not going to get better on your own. Can you talk to your school counselor? They‚Äôll have a good understanding of the dynamics of the school and will hopefully be able to give some advice on what you should do to get the behavior to stop or just have an adult to vent to when things get rough. 

Good luck xx",t3_dpahmy
f5uvs0d,t3_dpahmy,"If you are still friends with one of them of course you can ask them directly, but do you really want to? You seem quite aware of yourself and your surroundings so presumably you already have an understanding of how you are perceived. 

I think asking is giving power to your bullies and an opportunity to attack you. We all have flaws so even if what they say is true that doesn‚Äôt give them an excuse. And if you started behaving another way as a result then they‚Äôll just find something else to attack you about.",t3_dpahmy
f5w81oo,t3_dpahmy,"I agree with what the other commenters said.. But i would also like to add, you could consider going to see a school counselor or therapist to get an outside opinion. Do not let their opinion be what determines if you are ""right"" or ""wrong."" If you truly suspect you might be doing something wrong, get feedback from an adult who you know is fair and who you can trust.

Either way though.. Know that its impossible to please everyone. You may just have a different way of socializing than they do. Just because you are not like them doesnt mean you are wrong or should be made to feel bad. 

Also know that as soon as someone starts using terms like ""everybody"" and ""nobody"" to describe others opinion of you that is automatically bullshit. There is no one person who can speak on everyones behalf. Thats just hyperbolic language they use to make their opinions seem more important... But in truth it should be a red flag of probable garbage.

You mention a racial component too. Stuff might get dicey because of the social and political climate right now. But dont let any of that get under your skin. When you are older, and can get to living elsewhere, especially college or some neighborhood where people are more educated, it'll get better. Don't let this kind of thing turn you into one of them. Dont feel like you have to fulfill some kind of stereoype because you are asian.

 You just be the best version of yourself you can be. You seem sensitive and conscientious, which is great. Hold on, be strong. Focus on your goals for your future. You can get through this. Good luck.",t3_dpahmy

I have no long-term memory of my abuse. Just feelings and anxieties. No ‚Äúon this day, etc‚Äù.  When those feelings rush in, they can be very powerful. 

Professional help? Sure, it might help your PTSD.",t3_dmqy97
f58k6dl,t3_dmqy97,"I do, though slightly differently. I have that feeling of intense emotions surging inside me when I hear of others experiencing bullying and I'd liken it to pressure building inside a soda bottle after you've dropped it. It's sudden, intense but quickly starts to subside. I don't let the cap off because I know I'd lash out, but I concentrate instead on the fact that it's in the past and there's nothing I can do to change it but might be able help others. It's the reason I'm here now. I heard a song that triggered the feeling, in turn making me feel like sharing how it gets better and that one should not let it define their opinion of themselves. One thing that came of these internal ""cries"" of outrage, that warmth I feel in my chest as anger bubbles up for the people subjected to it, is that I can't stand by when I witness others being subjected to any kind of bullying. I've stepped in when I've seen kids ganging up on another and ridiculing them. I've spoken up when hearing others talking ill about someone simply because they are different. I'm not saying you should do so too, but that's how I turned it into a positive.

As for professional help, well, I'd say it all comes down to how you feel about it. If you feel that these emotions are overwhelming you and need help or tools to deal with them, then there is absolutely no shame in that. Too many people ignore that feeling of needing help and that's definitely a shame. Even if it's a loved one you feel safe expressing those feeling to, talking about it is better than internalizing it and waiting until it turns toxic. It's not pointless even if it feels that way.",t3_dmqy97

I guess it's just something weird to explain to other people who don't feel the same way or don't really get it, so it's comforting to know you're not the only one.
Again, thanks for sharing and for replying.",t3_dmqy97
f55jua1,t1_f55fadk,"No, you‚Äôre not alone. It was abuse, it was trauma. It was adult stuff that we didn‚Äôt have the knowledge or experience to process at the time so we buried it down for survival. I think of it like a rock in a tree stump, I grew over it, but it‚Äôs always there. 

But it robbed me of memories. My wife has clear memories of Christmas and birthdays. I don‚Äôt remember my childhood at all. Just comfort at times, anxiety and pain at others. I try to focus on the comforting feelings and know that I‚Äôm not in danger anymore. 

I feel it now, frankly. A prickly, warm feeling in my chest that radiates out when I‚Äôm in high anxiety.",t3_dmqy97

\- I developed depression and social phobia severely as a result. I could barely go into public places like malls and I ended up having to take online courses instead of classes it became so severe. 

\- In my experience and opinion, (you might want to include this in your report) bullying is a mental health issue - and as a result, a public health issue. It is connected to anxiety, depression, and suicide. 

\- bullying can be connected to being LGBT and having disabilities like autism. My country, Canada, ran a study concluding that LGBT kids face bullying 50% more often.

f0hiwoq,t3_d4ug3e,">  kids were arrested

Shit yeah, dude.  

So, uh, was there anything the school could have done to stop this?  Possible lawsuit?  Or maybe they're a possible ally, if they can put pressure on a prosecutor to charge your attackers.  There's also the possibility of local news media, if that's something you want to see happen.  I mean, if you're trying to keep your being gay a secret, obviously, you'll be weighing your options differently.  But I would say so far you're off to a great start in getting some justice.   

Get pictures of your injuries.  Lots of them, and make sure the lighting is good.  If you don't know what you're doing, take your pictures over and over with different camera settings in different light until you get it right. 

Being huge and straight, I'm not sure I'm in a position to really advocate this, but I guarantee that turning anything your bullies say about your sexuality around on them will cut deep.  I'm not sure you want to provoke them, though.  

Anyway, pursue any legal avenue open to you.  Make noise, and rock the boat.  They were arrested, so you know authorities are willing to do SOMETHING here; take it as far as they'll go.",t3_d4ug3e

ew4r1ej,t3_cmdftx,"Well, workplace bullying? Hmmmmm. I was a fat kid. I took abuse all during elementary, middle and secondary education. I took out my aggressions in wrestling and football as they were legal means to assault those who called me names (got one guy down on the mat, and crushed his testes with my knee.) People gave me a wide berth til I graduated. So, I go into public accounting. Did not know, that they put accounting students into pools, and aggression is fairly commonplace. My first firm, seemed to be rather cool. They specialized in entertainment. Learned a lot. HOWEVER, in my second year, the senior partner's nephew had lost his job at another firm, and came to work with us. (Found out later, he was fired for incompetence) From day 1, he let on that he was a relative and untouchable. He took to making the junior students lives abject misery. I went to bat more than once. Soon, he was a ""joker"". Given the level of focus and concentration necessary, one is not entirely aware of their surroundings. So, this little piss-ant starts casually sauntering up to several members of my group and flicking their ears. I know, stupid and puerile. He was warned to stop it. He did it to several of my subordinates. I got up and got in his face and told him to stop or there would be consequences. He laughed me off. Next afternoon, I feel the flick on my right ear. I repeated that if he did it once more, he would regret it. Five minutes later, I can feel him, and my elbow goes backwards into his solar plexus. As he goes down, my foot connects with his nuts. He begins to cry like a little child, and runs to one of the partners. (His uncle was on holidays). The partner comes out, and asks what was happening, suddenly four guys are telling him that the little piss ant was bored and was spending his time bothering people who were working. Partner turns to him and suspends him til his uncle returns. He leaves, and swears to us all that when his uncle returns, we will all lose our jobs. Week and a half later, uncle returns. He gets the full story, asks his nephew to return to the office. The guy has a smug look, like he is about to be really successful, when his uncle turns to him and says, ""If you want to continue working here, apologize."" He goes, ""Fuck off, I will not apologize to my ""lessers"". His uncle goes, well, I have to apologize to my staff, sorry for inflicting him on you, then tells the piss ant to go home, he is terminated. His jaw drops. He threatens and then leaves. Funny about two years later, I am working for another firm, and I see him come in for an interview. He did not see me, however, I was into the senior partners office not two minutes later, telling them that they should check with my former firm. His reputation was incontrovertible. Nobody wanted him around.",t3_cmdftx

I also have some advice: get involved with anti-bullying efforts and groups. You may find that others run into worse or better situations and that perspective might help, plus helping others going through something similar always helps. Plus you get Microsoft support (easy to get) and my company's support. we really want to see kids do whatever they are interested in, but really really well, and if bullying or school shootings is what they're interested in, they get lots of support.

If you've ever watched the Star Wars movies, there's a line said by one of the main characters, Qui Gon Jinn. It's, ""there's always a bigger fish"". Sometimes people that bully get too cocky and mess with the wrong people who can be equally if not more vicious. Especially those bullies that don't learn this lesson in childhood/adolescence. 

I've heard stories in my years in the workforce, and people can be downright vicious in their retaliation. From vandalism and destruction of property (ex. people putting nails under other people's car tires, so when the person backs up, you know what happens...) to setting up situations to physically harm someone but made to look like an accident. I've never done these things (luckily never really had too as most adults I've come across are reasonable people) and feel some of these responses may be extreme, but I can't say I feel sympathy for bullies that don't know when to stop either.",t3_byfukb

epveat6,t3_bt75kr,"Nice, I think the technique you are doing sounds very similar to a mindfulness meditation technique I was taught. 

I was taught several years ago of a technique to use if you find yourself in emotional distress. First visually point out 5 things you can visually see around you and acknowledge what they are. I see a computer, my cat, a mango tree outside the window, a red car on the road, a dust bunny underneath the desk. 

Then observe 5 things you hear. I hear an airplane fly overhead, the whir of an oscillating fan, my cat meow, the floorboards creak underneath me, my breathing.

Then observe 5 things you feel. I feel the cold air in my nose and throat. I feel the softness of the cushion I'm sitting on. I feel warm in my upper body with the sweater on, I feel my heartbeat, my cat's fur.

The great thing is, this technique only takes several minutes to do. It doesn't have to be exactly 5 things if you happen to be in a bit of a sensory deprived place it can be less. But I was taught 5, that's what I normally go with. I've found it to be extremely effective in clearing my mind and helping me to feel emotionally content. The maximum amount of times I need to repeat the exercise to feel better is twice. And it helps me be a lot more observant and self aware in real life too. Have better focus.",t3_bt75kr

It took a lot of will power for me to feel comfortable going to the movie theaters on my own but that really helped me feel confident on doing my own things. That I could do it and felt safe. 

I got a hobby (sewing) that makes me research things about sewing so I can get better. I also enjoy cooking and baking so I do research on that. I do them for other people (family, friends, co-workers). People say my stuff is really great and there is a noticeable improvement in what I do. I feel proud for that.

I'm go walking on local trails or take day hikes and take some time on the walk/hike to reflect on what's around me. What am I interested in, what can I learn? It makes me happy.

A journal will help too. It's really weird but something my therapist did teach me was a ""achievement"" or ""GLAD"" journal.

At the end of your day, reflect on things you did. Then either write down 3 things that just made you happy/proud or something you achieved/succeeded at (lost weight, took a nature walk, made a costume, watched a movie, made a cake, etc). Or use the GLAD system.  Write:

* Something you're Grateful for. 
* Something you Learned. 
* Something you Achieved. 
* Something you were Delighted about.

Then take some time and read back on what you wrote previously. It helps you shape your negative thoughts into positive thoughts.

It seems dumb but I will say it has helped. I was becoming very reclusive and afraid to express myself. I'm putting more of myself out there and I'm getting positive responses in return.",t3_bruyjw

Amanda Michelle Todd (November 27, 1996 ‚Äì October 10, 2012), was a 15-year-old Canadian student and victim of cyberbullying who committed suicide by hanging at her home in Port Coquitlam, a city in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Before her death, Todd posted a video on YouTube in which she used a series of flash cards to tell her experience of being blackmailed into exposing her breasts via webcam, and of being bullied and physically assaulted. The video went viral after her death, resulting in international media attention. The video has had more than 12 million views as of August 2018.

Thinking back, all that made me special was probably that I made myself known as an easy target. I didn't fight back. I didn't insult them back, or beat them up (not that it would have worked, I was a tiny girl, late bloomer). I didn't tell on them at school, I told my mom and she told me to ignore them. Which kinda didn't work because sooner or later I would cry. So making me cry = fun, and all it took to make me cry was steal my pencil case or my shoe, or throw a tomato at me from behind, or mock how I pronounced that word wrong in English class three weeks ago (haunts me to this day, I'm still scared of mispronouncing it).

Once off the bus she angrily demanded ""why did you look at me like a piece of shit?"" and I didn't know what to say, I've never understood how bullies seem completely unable to link their horrible behaviour with people's negative reactions to it",t3_b8b6d6

I can‚Äôt even imagine having your parents not believe you. My mom is my only friend through all of this and she supports me all the way. It‚Äôs honestly one of the few reasons that I still have hope of better things in the future. I‚Äôm so sorry! 

A few years ago, I had a really good friend and we kinda took their bullying together. I was on the opposite team from all of them last year (my school has teams to divide the kids into because it‚Äôs a pretty big school because it‚Äôs the only one in town), so we were both pretty lonely. Believe it or not, they left her alone for most of year. This one day, people started telling me that this friend had gotten ISP (in school suspension) for three day. She never even cussed let alone do anything worthy of getting ISP. I later found out that one of the girls from the gang took her chapstick and my friend tried to get it back, and accidentally scratcher her in the process (she has long nails). The one who took her chapstick went to the office and reported that she had: choker her, punched her, pinched her, and scratched her on purpose. The whole gang backed her up as witnesses even though most of them weren‚Äôt even in the room. She got ISP for three days. I helped her through it, but I was so furious. The next year, she joined the posse and hasn‚Äôt talked to me since, unless it‚Äôs something with teasing and such. I don‚Äôt know how it happened but that was by far the worst thing that they have done to me. They took away my best friend, and now I‚Äôm completely alone. I am making new friends, (I didn‚Äôt have many at the time because every time I got close to someone that posse would swoop in and make them feel special, and the next day it would be me and that friend again alone at lunch) so I‚Äôm not completely alone but over half of those friends are in the middle of me and queen bee. I have no doubt who they would go to if something happened and we needed support or something. 

(Last thing, I promise) Me and queen bee have always been in sports with each other, and I practice and try harder than her so I was high point man in b-ball usually, and I‚Äôm a higher jumper, and faster runner than her in track. In basketball, coach just asked her to be on a team with the seniors this summer. The seniors! He asked her and two of her members of the gang. I wasn‚Äôt trying to brag or anything when I said I was high point man, I was trying to say that I work harder than her, yet she gets the glory. He didn‚Äôt even ask me. He did ask my best friend though. I‚Äôm happy for her just furious. I had to work way harder because the only one who would pass me the ball ever was my best friend or I had to get the rebound. There were so many moments of queen bee or someone stealing the ball, me sprinting down there and had an open game winning shot opportunity, but she was too far up her own booty and she couldn‚Äôt even pass it to me. I jumped about 4 inches higher than her at a previous meet, and o just found out she‚Äôs on A team. I haven‚Äôt found out for myself yet though. If I don‚Äôt get on A team, I‚Äôm going to be furious because I literally am giving my all. It just makes me mad that she is on A team cuz of her mom and that she booty sucks. 

Sorry for the rant, it felt good to get that out. I didn‚Äôt mean for it to be this longüòÇ

People like that are messed up and tbh belong in a mental asylum. I got punched in the face by two girls on the bus back home from school once and then they had the nerve to yell to the whole bus that I was being horrible to them by giving them evil looks as a result. And what was worse was that my childhood friend at the time - who I thought was my friend - agreed with them and encouraged them to retaliate against the looks I was giving them by giving them my contact info (mobile no/email address/address etc.) to harass me with.",t3_b8b6d6

As someone who has coincidentally dealt with a similar situation myself, I just want you to remember that she is very likely bullying you because she and her gang are actually scared of you in some way and you make them feel secretly insecure on the inside, no doubt by being a better person than them. If you can, try to record all your interactions with her and her gang. Keep any proof of her nastiness - hopefully there'll be an opportunity to expose her in one way or another, and even her mum won't be able to do anything about it in a situation like that. Hang in there - hopefully you can finish school sooner or later and won't have to deal with the queen bee anymore in life. Meanwhile, if you want someone to talk to, please send me a private message and I'll always try to help/listen in any way I can.

If it helps, when I was in primary school ( UK equivalent of elementary)  a girl (who I'll call J) who thought she ruled the school and hated me out of nowhere (I don't know what I did to her)  would falsely report to the teacher every single day about something I did which was never true. One time she even accused me of leaving bruises on her friend's leg even though there were no bruises there at all. J's mother was head of the board of governors of the school, so of course the teachers always believed J and punished me. Since there was no one to tell me otherwise (her mother was also friends with my parents who always would believe J over me) I actually thought I could do nothing right and even felt suicidal at one point. In Year 4 (4th grade) we got a  teacher who had just joined the school who treated everyone fairly and didn't live by J's rules. For once I wasn't getting punished every single day - or at all - as this teacher wouldn't simply listen to everything J said, and even reprimanded J whenever she acted up in class/did something wrong, which the other teachers never dared. Unfortunately, J then complained to her mother this teacher was abusing her and despite having no proof at all, her mother rallied the board of governors and got this teacher fired.  Nevertheless, this teacher was just who I needed to show me that I wasn't a bad person and was worth something. Sometimes I believe that my never allowing myself to be torn down by bullies ever since was because  I partially owed it to her to prove I was worth what she saw in me...",t3_b8b6d6
ek1954g,t1_ek0n7eg,"Thank you for telling me your story and please don't apologise. Anything else you want to get out please just say. As someone who was a 'weird kid' in primary and high school and very badly bullied throughout, I'm here to help others in the same situation. :)

&#x200B;

I'm glad to hear your mum is a friend to you and has your back. (I'm afraid I never had that from my people-pleasing parents) I hope she continues to support you throughout school and be that glimmer of hope that encourages you to just do you, which the teacher was for me. You will make her proud, I'm certain of it.

&#x200B;

In my opinion, the fact that the posse keep trying to steal your friends only serves to confirm that they are actually scared of you and as a result keep focusing on you and stealing your allies to make sure you have no support against them. And your ex-friend is a traitor and moreover a coward. One small incident and her loyalties were flipped - goes to show how weak she is. I had a supposed friend too who was sisterly with me during childhood but then high school comes and she wanted to be cool, so started  ganging up on me with the popular crowd, and would always try to swoop in whenever she saw me getting friendly with anyone she liked. One particular incident that still stands out to me was when we were on a bus together and she provoked two girls to punch me in the face. Those two girls - doing exactly what bullies do - then proceeded to be angry at me for giving them evil looks in response, and my 'friend' tried to suck up to them by giving the girls ALL my contact info (mobile/home no, email address, home address etc) so that they could retaliate against me.

&#x200B;

Your queen bee will get her come-uppance served one day - once out in the real world, she cannot go through life hiding behind her mommy all the time, and once her mommy's powers hit a wall she'll be lost. I have proof of that: The aforementioned 'friend' once told  me she was unhappy in her life with her job (my mom keeps trying to be BFFs with her mom and keeps inviting them around our house still.) I've also recently found out through mutual contacts that she is still the person she was in high school, trying to turn my other friends against me (and now failling) by claiming I spent the whole of high school bullying her and inflicting on her all the things she did to me. And that J from my previous post got depression in college, took 6 years to complete a 3 year degree and has now jetted off to god knows where to recover from her breakdown. Guess mommy's protection could only go so far....

I was lucky I didn't have much to do with Kurst the Worst at school apart from her sometimes getting my bus.  I don't get why she even targeted me but I was one of those people who just seemed to arrive at school with target written above my head.

ek0ijb2,t1_ek0gr54,"> I was one of those people who just seemed to arrive at school with target written above my head. 

The number of times I've felt that way at school isn't even countable. Used to say that I somehow naturally have the look of someone one would like to bully. It was only years later when one of the bullies in my high school befriended me after I'd saved her from a few homework-crises and explained that they didn't like how I was not only different from the 'cool' kids but actually content to be as such. 

&#x200B;

LOL I've actually had a girl go running to the teachers crying her eyes out when I once called her a female Draco Malfoy. This girl had the nerve to throw tantrums and complain to anyone she met that I was torturing her because I wouldn't let her go through my school bag/steal my lunch/scribble all over my exercise books. She actually got a mental breakdown in the final year of high school, which she blamed on one of her cronies who had probably finally stood up to her and fought back after 5-6 years of being her punching bag.

It sucked and sometimes made me feel bad about myself a little bit. But I wasn't the type of guy who this things stick to his mind and make him depressed and all that shit. But about 6 months ago I decided not to let them say whatever they wanna say to me and make feel bad; even for one second. From the moment, I usually don't give a fuck about most what people say. And in the past 6 months, I got into fists fights twice with these assholes. Once one of them started to talk shit and I warned him 4 times that ""I don't fuck with you, leave me alone"" but he didn't listen and as the 5th warning, I punched him in the face and tried to put him on the ground but people came and seprerated us .Exaclty how I wanted. Another dat someone who knew that I'm sensitive about my mother came and started joking and talking shit about her. Again I warned him a couple times and I told him that I'm angry and you gotta stop it. So technically he had the knowledge that I'm mad but he didn't stop so I beat the shit outta him and make him rest for 3 days at home.
 Here's the deal: the bullying ain't gonna stop until you make it. And you have to do only 2 things: 
#1 Don't give a fuck about what a hater says. I mean if someone EVEN REALLY things that you're ugly, then let them thing whatever the fuck they wanna. The real beuty is from inside. Who cares about what a hater says? Have you ever seen a hater better than yourself? Me neither!
#2 face them and shit on them and make them feel fucked up just with talking. If you cannot, tell them that it's not cool and try to stay calm and leave them. If all of it didn't work or they wanted to hurt you physically, fight them back. No matter who starts a fight, make sure YOU are the one who finishes it. And don't hurt them bad so you don't get yourself in trouble.

If you feel depressed, anxious, have insomnia or bad nightmares from the bullying, or even feel suicidal, go to your GP and tell him about it, so he refers you to a mental health professional. At this point you can also ask him to free you from attendance.

Realistically tho, to some extent I'd grit my teeth and just realize that school is an artificial construct that you have to suffer thru, and find purpose and happiness outside of school.  I hated school, I never personally had a lot of friends and always kinda just kept to myself, but I had hobbies outside of school that I liked so I just went, minded my own business and then when I got home I was able to do what I wanted.  What do you like to do for fun?  Do more of that!  Don't concentrate on people who make you miserable, think what you like to do, what makes you happy, and pursue happiness.  ",t3_aoq7sk

But from that you can deduce one thing: It's not your fault. They are the ones looking for trouble, they are the ugly and disturbed ones, not us.

So I went through the channels - school admin, she saw her doctor for antidepressants,  goes to therapy, blocked the bullies on social, I spoke with the parents.  It helped.  Then it started up again.  I found a lawyer specializing in education law.  She wrote a letter to school superintendent and a cease and desist letter to the parents detailing kids behavior and letting them know we'll push this issue to calling police, filing restraining order, suing for damages.  She arranged and attended a joint school meeting with us, daughter, daughter's  teachers, counselor, vice principal and school psychologist to develop safety plan so they're fully aware of situation and developed a safety plan, insulate herself - the group came up with great ideas.  The meeting was through an IEP (individualized education plan).  I started this process early into the depression and grades falling due to bullying.   Good luck, this really tugs at my heartstrings!",t3_amau9z
efp15el,t3_amau9z,"First, I want to say your daughter is amazing. Took me years to get the courage and strength she has to stand up to these middle school bullies. I know how awful it can be- those insecure girls think they are just so cool bullying others.

Now, the fact that the school actually did something amazes me. Props for that and props to you for making an effort.  You needed to contact them it was the right thing to do. Unfortunately, bratty little bullying 8th-grade girls won't see it that way. But you made the right choice.

Your daughter is a strong young woman and she has already stood up to those girls once before. She will have to stand her ground again if they approach her like that more. Nothing breaks a bully more than someone with confidence and I say this with experience. Sure, those girls might still be rude to your daughter, but unfortunately, there is nothing that can be done about that. I know this is not what you want to hear but from experience, you can't change other people, just yourself. Your daughter just can't let those girls break her.

  
Hang in there. Graduation is almost there. I remember counting down the days when I was in her position just 4 years ago. I actually go to school today with some of the bullies from my school. I got lucky and they grew up enough not to bother me. They probably also didn't want to try dealing with me again after I started standing up for myself. Still sometimes hurts to see them walk around, but as a senior in high school now we are all civil and they act as if it never happened. Fine by me, won't complain. Also, the chance of those girls still being friends by senior year of high school is so low. They bond over what? making fun of people? they have to stop eventually... then what? That's what happened in my case. Justice can take years to play out... remember that.

It was covered statements making fun of me, ignoring me, or making me feel stupid (and then she'd be my friend as if nothing ever happened). Because I slowly figured it out - I slowly separated my life from theirs. But when I told my mom or other sister how I felt they both said that they didn't want to get involved. Well, when I felt strong, I told my mom (even if she didn't want to get involved) that I didn't like the family dynamic and that I wouldn't spend time with the family for holidays in the future. And that something needed to change. And she talked to my dad (who was doing it too). And then my sister heard and she apologized to me. It didn't fix everything. I just hung out with the family this weekend and my niece is a little version of my sister - the little s#$%t - and tried to insult me a few times.

All I can say is that adult life is going to be NOTHING like highschool. The handful of successful adults i've known in my life are the ones who live their lives pretending that they are the only human on the planet who matters.

&#x200B;

Don't waste a minute of your day thinking about what other people do or think. Fuck the whole lot of them. Many of these guys are going to end up addicted or in jail. some of them will have relatives that bail them out and help them survive, and a few others will end up dead before they turn 30. (statistically speaking, in other words, some of these highschool kids you know will be dead before they hit 30. More reason you don't want to compare yourself to others or even bother yourself with what they do.)

&#x200B;

I'm in my late 30's, and have lost friends over the years. guys I knew since highschool, and it really brought home the point of how short life is. One of them died at 19, the other one died at 23. Yet another one turned full schizophrenic in his 20's and has been in a mental hospital since. I work full time and live on my own and i'm doing okay, but many other people I knew growing up aren't.

&#x200B;

If I could speak to my 18 year old self, i would say this: Fuck the world. Fuck your friends, fuck your parents, and fuck everyone else. Focus on yourself. Do you. Think of what you want to do with life, it's not that long and you only get one shot at it. Don't waste it thinking about others.

&#x200B;

The universe is thousands of years old. It has existed long before you were born and will exist thousands of years after you die. You have absolutely no control over any of that.

&#x200B;

The exception being a very very short brief period of time, between your physical birth and death, where you actually have the ability to control, manipulate, and interact with the universe. With your hands, with your feet, with your actions, with your thoughts. This is a very special time for you as a sentient being.

As for your other neighbors. If they are reasonable people perhaps you can try to find an opportunity to strike up a conversation with them and sneak your side of the story in.

I wouldn't try and force your daughter to be friends with neighborhood kids either if the kids are already acting strange around her. That could lead to her getting bullied by other kids.

e7iuonk,t3_9myssy,"Dear kurka00,

it is unbelievable but true that a lot of teachers are trying to be blind if they suspect any conflict. Maybe I can give you a little bit consolation. Sometimes a positive thing can growing up out of a very fucking situation. 
I was a victim of bullying more than 5 years, in a german middle school. Every teacher knowed about that, but nobody helped me. If a teacher saw something, he/she left or just looked away. After this martyrium I decided to do something against this shit. So, I catch up on gymnasium (the german Highschool) and today I study to become a teacher. Of course, the bullying was at last not the only reason for my decision- but a central. I promise, I will not close my eyes from bullying and I will do everything to support victims- if it‚Äòs necessary, even with unconventional methods. I studied a lot of anti-bullying programms and psychological stuff about prevention and even about victim protection. 
It‚Äôs sad, but the theme bullying is not a theme at my university- maybe that‚Äòs one reason for the situations, you describe.  Therefore I also talked with the president for teachers of our university and maybe in a few years ( ^^) the theme became a place in our modules.

I‚Äòm so sorry for your situation! Please hold on - and if you are interestet in some tips against this fucking bullys, I can gave you.



(P.S.: I‚Äòm sorry for my miserable English; I only study German Language and Philosophy^^)",t3_9myssy
e7kb415,t3_9myssy,"Hi!

I‚Äòm very pleased to read that you commit to bullying prevention too! In my practical semesters I make the experience that most of the teachers just were overworked and so, they want to have as little stress as possible- even if they got more money for special projects, they literally ‚Äûfighted‚Äú in the teacher‚Äôs room about not to do extra work. So, I think it would be more effective to reduce lessons for some teachers to ‚Äûfight‚Äú against bullying in different ways and talk to victims and culprits. The collegues, which are not interested in bullying prevention and help have to give the lessons instead of these who take responsibility. But your thoughts are great, I go with you: if the money is there, it could be an encouragement for teachers. And further, the geste to pay more money would be a sign for teachers and shows them how important it is to hold the eyes open and do (!) something against bullying. Maybe this combination of reduce lessons and pay more money could be work.",t3_9myssy
e7jqnlt,t1_e7iuonk,"Hi, Kurka00 and Tine-Otis!

As an American student of education, I am inspired by both of your posts. As you probably already know, the bullying here is causing mass shootings at schools.  I am searching for ways that schools can prevent bullying situations and intervene if it does happen. Your posts give insight into the problem with teachers ignoring the behavior. Do you think that if teachers were given monetary bonuses for stopping bullying incidents, they would take more action?",t3_9myssy
e7s073n,t1_e7kb415,"Hi, Tine-Otis! You make an excellent point. Teaching is already a ""around the clock"" type of job and these teachers don't want to add more stress and work to their already busy schedules. I would probably feel the same way. I agree that bullying has to be addressed in some way, for I believe that emotional success is more important than academic success. If we have a society full of intellects with social anxiety and distrust of humanity, then we have a corrupt society with little regard for ethical decisions. Hmmm..kinda sounds like American society, now that I put it in words.ü§î Perhaps the best way to solve this is to incorporate lessons of kindness into the every academic lesson that is taught. That may be tricky, but I'm sure we can figure it out. Thanks so much for your insight and inspiration! ",t3_9myssy

But, it sounds like your ego did what it had to do to protect you and establish your place in this crazy world. What kind of bullying were you exposed to by peers? In my research, I found that kids bully because they fear what is different from them. Girls, especially, tease because they are jealous. Perhaps they were jealous of your physical maturity, causing them to feel insecure about themselves. Whatever the case, always remember that you are a strong woman now because you overcame those tormenting years. You have a husband and a job, and are willing to stand up for yourself. So, congrats on that! Thanks again for sharing.üòä",t3_9iebhg

It probably would have been easier on you if you stayed overnight, so they could get to know the real you. Instead, they let their jealousy use you to vent their own frustrations. Also, I understand not wanting to go to the reunion (anyone would..I didn't want to go to mine either).  I can't believe she actually brought up finances..ugh, she's clueless. As far as your husband goes..that is just horrible that he got punished for being thoughtful. I can't imagine how that damaged his faith in people. I am glad that you found each other though.

e6o6ic8,t1_e6o51hq,"Thank you for checking on me! Yesterday, I had a sit down meeting with my immediate boss and the owner. 

I think it hit my immediate boss that he is closest to Keith at work. They chat all the time about baseball and movies and just stuff. And he just kind of facepalmed himself and said, ""I know why you didn't come to me... you thought that I'd warn him but wouldn't have really taken this stuff very seriously or stopped it. I can see why you didn't bring this up to me. I am sorry if you felt you weren't safe with speaking to me."" 

They were really trying to see it from both angles and I commend them for it. My immediate boss even asked if it would be okay to call my husband and just apologize if he ever caused him to worry or feel like work was dangerous for me. I thought that was sweet but weird. I said my husband is good if I am good. He's alright if I am done by right. 

I haven't heard yet from management, but a co-worker texted him to ask where he was today (Wednesday) and he said he wasn't with the company anymore. I am very sad, but I am going to hold my head high and try not to cry. ",t3_9iebhg
e6uq886,t1_e6rp6r5,"The physical maturity aspect was definitely jealousy underlined with a certain disdain and hatred for someone diffrent. It's a pack mentality.

I wasn't as well off as my peers in school. It was a private, christian, co-educational boarding school. My father worked there and so I was given a scholarship (based on merit and keeping my grades above a certain mark). I never fit in with my peers who came from extremely wealthy backgrounds. 

It was because I got to go home everyday and they had to stay in dorms. A lot of them had divorced parents so seeing my parents picking me up, packing my food for lunch and caring for me in many ways had a lot of them very, very jealous of me. 

I wouldn't say we we're poor, but firmly middle-class. The fact that I didn't have certain branded clothing that was ""in"" but usually wore hand-me-downs or shopped at Goodwill made me an outcast. We didn't have a uniform. To this day, I go out of my way to buy clothes that do not have writing or brands prominently displayed because of my past experiences. 

I got an invitation for my 10 year high school reunion and I RSVP'ed saying I wasn't attending. One of the girls who had tormented me most of my life was the organizer, and she reached out to me and asked me why I wasn't coming back and then proceeded to allude that financial assistance could be arranged (like a gofund me page or something) and I was pretty upset by that. 

My husband had similar experiences of bullying in school. He went to public school but in an extremely affluent suburb. He was one of the more middle class students attending school in that area. My husband had it waaaay worse. 

He was leaving an arcade at the mall. He saw two older kids from his school he stopped and gave them all his tickets because he was leaving and he thought it was a nice thing to do. 

Well, he left, they followed him to the bus stop and decided for shits and giggles to beat the ever loving crap out of him. They picked up a discarded tire iron and beat him within an inch of his life. A homeless man saw all this ran inside a gas station and called 911. 

By the time the ambulence/police came those two boys had disappeared. My husband had severe swelling on the brain. He had memory loss and even suffered personality changes because of this. 

He was unable to press charges or recieve justice as he could not remember who did this to him. He told me that if he went back to his home town and sat down next to them at a bar he wouldn't recognize them. ",t3_9iebhg
e7e5cqa,t1_e6vt85o,"I think bullying (especially severe bullying) needs EVERYONE involved. From other students, to teachers, to administrators, to parents. Everyone needs to be involved. 

The worst are the parents who believe their darling Ashley or Lauren couldn't do any wrong. The people who believe they raised a ""Saint"". It starts with being able to speak up for yourself and teaching children it's okay to rock the boat and it's not okay to sit down and shut up. So often I was afraid I would be brushed off or not taken seriously. (i.e. ""Have you tried ignoring them?"" or ""Boys will be Boys, You need thicker skin!"") The crux of the matter is, I feel like society normalizes bulling to an extent, which is why everyone needs to get involved.

You need to be able to make sure that students feel safe coming to you. but don't push them to open. If you notice a shy or vulnerable kid, just say, I am here to hear you but don't probe or pester them to open up. Kids need to know that the bullying won't get worse because they spoke up or that they will be called a 'snitch' or attacked more viciously. Maybe even knowing if kids in your class have siblings and approaching them or asking them to help out a bit can be a good start. So many siblings I know wanted to protect their younger brothers or sisters. Other kids need to be taught it's not okay to gang up on someone, it's better to call someone out instead of intentionally having a mob mentality. 

If you need to advise kids, tell them to start documenting instances. And keep documenting until the problem is no more. Take screenshots, pictures, video/recordings. Keep notes. There's nothing worse than being called a liar and having no evidence to prove your position.

My mother wanted me to not speak about this encounter as she was afraid I would be judged. I spoke out and had to wear a Scarlett letter for most of middle and high school.

e4ewi2s,t3_98c4ma,"I would suggest creating a petition to Demand their immediate termination, and having as many of the other Sign it and give full testimonials to the harassment because that is what this is!!!! These two are creating a ""Hostile Work Environment"" and that is unacceptable! Harassment of any nature is unacceptable and ILLEGAL in some shape or form in all states, Federal or privet employee regardless.

Ask for a meeting with your supervisor, union rep, and HR directer, with you and the other workers there, present this petition to them. Make the wording clear that you the ""GROUP"" want them GONE NOW, and why. If there are only 5-6 of you this can be an up hill battle but if there are 10+ you will have the power here. In a ""victim's word against theirs"" the more victims the better, If the two try to sue they wont have a tooth pick to stand on!!! And should you and the group be terminated you will have been handed a ""Wrongful termination lawsuit"" on a silver platter! 

You'll want to check your employee hand book or contract but there are bound to be clauses that you can invoke to light a fire under management to do there job.

Not sure what state your in so I do not know what laws apply here so a re-post on r/legaladvice may be a good next step. A consult with a lawyer versed in Harassment law and having him present during the meeting would be a better idea. 

The petition can/ should also contain (but may not need) threats of class action lawsuit or strike on the part of the victim employs, if action of some kind is not taken immediately. More than likely management is in a ""rock or hard"" place situation wit these two and cannot act due to a lack of tangible proof, however enough circumstantial proof can be enough. So keep in mind management may not be  your enemy here and there hands could just be tied is all.

In most cases it's not what you say it's how you say it to management. If you come at them with threats and attacks they will not help you. Instead come at them with a ""this is bad, but this could be a lot worse"" mentality, and their tune / actions change drastically. The class action lawsuit is the nuclear option here, in which case no one is walking away happy for the most part. You will probably lose your job and others will probably too and not to mention you'll burn your Bridge with that employer. 

To be blunt American society is rapidly turning into a pack of pussies!!! Everyone is so terrified of being sued they can't even stand up for themselves. On top of that everyone is so terrified of losing their s***** job they keep letting stuf like this slide.

I‚Äôm a contractor at a Navy installation. Most of my job is an office environment. I have two meeting rooms in which I provide technical support. There‚Äôs a guy who used to work in the Public Works area of things and now has an office position. Public Works are the fix-it guys of the base. This guy has been in the position for a few years now and has never said a word to me. I‚Äôve barely talked to him outside of requests to put a ticket in to Public Works to have stuff repaired (part of his job). Never really saw him that much either. It wasn‚Äôt until this year that, for some reason unbeknownst to me, he‚Äôs been condescending and patronizing towards me whenever I‚Äôve brought up things regarding my job, just needlessly and sarcastically giving me a hard time. The only thing I can think of is the fact that one of his Public Works buddies is now in the same office as him, so now he has an audience to be a comedian. 

Things escalated this week when he decided to make me look foolish in front of other people. He was standing in the parking lot at the building I have one of my rooms in. He was there with a handful of other facilities people, including his supervisor. I got out of my car and he comes up to me to tell me the sprinklers went off and I had to get all of those people out of there because the whole place was flooded. Perplexed, considering I had just been there 20 minutes before, I turned and went to go inside. That was his cue to tell me, ‚Äúhuh, huh, huh, huh! I‚Äôm just kidding with ya! Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh!‚Äù Actually he turned around to tell his audience he was just kidding with me, so all of his cronies would laugh. Then he says, and I thought he was kinda dumb to tell me this, ‚ÄúI saw you pull in and I said, ‚Äòwatch, I‚Äôm gonna get this guy!‚Äô‚Äù Now on the surface I realize that it really doesn‚Äôt sound that bad. It‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs threatening me. But I felt it said volumes about how he thought of me. Like I said before, this is a guy I‚Äôve never even had a conversation with and somehow he thought this was okay. Of course these are the type of guys who think it‚Äôs ‚Äújust busting balls‚Äù. Sorry, that doesn‚Äôt fly with me. I deserve to be able to do my job without having to worry about this crap.

After I got done with what I needed to do for that room I went back to my office and called the guy. I asked him what it was I did to him that was making him be so disrespectful to me. I told him that every time I talk with him he‚Äôs been condescending and patronizing and now he‚Äôs made a point to make an ass out of me needlessly in front of others and I wasn‚Äôt having it. I said that maybe if we were friends I could understand joking around, but I brought up the point that we‚Äôve never even had one conversation. I added the rhetorical question, ‚Äúwhat, are we in junior high?‚Äù I was mad, but I didn‚Äôt yell or resort to swearing or name calling. As much as I wanted to call him a fucking asshole, I didn‚Äôt and I kept it as mature as I could. He had nothing to say besides repeating matter-of-factly over and over that he was sorry and that it will never happen again. How sincere he was remains to be seen. I can only imagine he had a good chuckle with the other boys in the office after he got off the phone with me.

I don‚Äôt get what it is about the dynamic in these blue collar jobs. Someone who is ‚Äújust busting balls a little‚Äù usually invites others to pile on. You are forced to take it, and if you make an issue out of it you‚Äôre the asshole who can‚Äôt take a joke. If you just try to ignore it, they find other ways to get under your skin. You can‚Äôt win. If you do try to confront the problem now you‚Äôll have guys who will not only stop talking to you, but will find little passive/aggressive ways to fuck with you and make your life miserable until you quit. These guys subscribe to the attitude of being ‚Äúreal men‚Äù and any sign of weakness or even having feelings for that matter will result in being labeled a ‚Äúpussy‚Äù. I see no difference between this and what happens in a school yard.  These guys hide behind saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a joke‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just kidding around with you‚Äù. In any other line of work this would be considered a hostile working environment.

I don‚Äôt mean to disparage a whole group of people. The guys in Public Works at my job have all been courteous and respectful to me and the ones I‚Äôve gotten to know a little I genuinely liked. However anyone who has ever worked in that environment (and I have, before graduating college) will know the kind of people I‚Äôm talking about. They‚Äôre the same guys working construction, landscaping and in warehouses. If there was ever a case to make about ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù you will find it in these places. 

tl;dr - 46-year-old dealing with a guy he barely knows who thinks it‚Äôs okay to be condescending and patronizing and make a person the butt of a joke in front of other people. Exploring the dynamic of men who work in blue collar environments.",t3_95i3en

It also sounds like you are experiencing strong compassion when you witness bullying on TV. This is a beautiful and very human emotion that many bullies lack completely. It can be overpowering at first, but as you get older it will give you strength and conviction.  If nothing else, the bullies gave you the gift of compassion. Use it to help others if you can one day. The world really needs compassionate people like you.

Bullies only look for two things... Reaction and fear. If you can keep these to yourself, the bullies will eventually leave or look elsewhere. The anxiety you feel is this fear. It will pass in time, but see if you can find alternative interests to help. Animals and nature are good therapy for this...

e2vv5oa,t3_90wnei,"I really enjoyed your film, thank you for sharing! 

I think bullying can be stopped, maybe not the start, that first incident, but definitely the next.
I think the two biggest obstacles are:

* the victim being unwilling or unable to stand up 
* others not standing up, I think [this article addresses those reasons](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/signe-whitson/six-reasons-why-bystander_b_4295181.html)

So how do we fix this? I think asking the kid backed into the corner to overcome the scary kid who is yelling their face is unrealistic alone. There are kids who will, but most will not.  

The way that I see it, the easiest route is changing the way bystanders act and I think we are doing that. I've mentioned this many times but in my home everyone trains MMA. For the 6 in our house, we are covering ages from 5 to 38. It is a household rule that no one is to use any striking on anyone except in the defense of others, in fact helping other kids will get you extra deserts or a rewards (pretty big stuff for little kids.) Now we don't tell them to strike first, we tell them to tell the teacher, go play with the kid getting bullied, be a friend, the same as they would want if it was them being bullied etc and only if the bully touches the other kid can they subdue the bully. In our little house, we are changing how we react with the world around us. We don't assume ""Someone else will surely step in"", we step in and we are teaching the next generation to do the same by teaching our kids. We are preparing for ""If I say anything, he‚Äôll turn on me next!"" by training everyday in MMA. We teach our kids and practice being good human beings to each other, by trying to be a friend, being supportive and encouraging during this crap so we all can come out better. I think if more people took this proactive stance then we could get it under control. It may not be the best idea, but it is something.",t3_90wnei

Without details, it's hard to say what your best move is. What they're doing could be in violation of federal labor protections, or it might not be... but you can read the 1st link and get an idea of whether it applies to you or not. Regardless, it appears to be against McDonalds internal policies (harassment, bullying, being assigned crappy duties that no one else has to do and/or getting hours cut for speaking up about the maltreatment you're suffering) and if you do not have someone you may report it to at your actual job, you can report it to their HR or even via a hotline, as noted in the second link. (Around page 10.) Just some resources for you and I hope they help. No one should have to dread work because they're being mistreated... there's enough reason to hate work already without that added baggage! :P  But really, we all need to make a living and making it that much harder on someone to do just that is unacceptable.

In high school, it switched to fat jokes and constant ridicule.  

I'm 26 years old, in a serious relationship, with a job that I don't hate.  And I STILL think about being bullied almost every day.  I relive the experiences.  I think the worst one was when my dad bought me a band t-shirt that I had wanted really badly, and I was so excited to wear it to school.  This popular boy ended up wearing the same shirt one day, and passed me in the hall.  There were hundreds of kids around and he said, probably as loudly as possible, ""Why is some FAT GIRL wearing my shirt?""  And literally everyone laughed at me.

That moment just had a severe impact on me.  I've moved on with my life, but I still often feel humiliated, angry, and wary of other people.  I'm always afraid of strangers judging me and I don't like experiences or situations where I don't know what to expect.  I have a lot of social anxiety and I tend to be a loner.  I still have a weight problem. It's almost like being made fun of and called fatty and tub of lard your entire life has a negative affect.  \*eye roll.\*

Seriously if you have the ability to talk to your kids about bullying and think you can make a difference, please do it.

I'm 54 years old now, and with the help of loved ones and medications, have finally been able to get rid of most of the ill effects of the trauma i suffered from the ages of 8 to 17.

It ""gets better"" in terms of the fact that the daily torture of bullying goes away for most of us.  But the scars and wounds don't just go away.

She ended up failing me for incompetence, but honestly, she hated me, knittpicked me apart, found the smallest flaws in me, and blew them up exponetially finding any excuse for me to fail. I ran into her at the grocery store a few weeks after I failed. She saw me, didn't even say high, and just kinda snorted at me. This was a huge blow to my confidence. I am currently job searching and I can't get this out of my head. I am afraid of running into such things at work and I don't know how I would handle them. PM me if you need someone to talk to.

dspjgoh,t3_7ontm0,"> I don't know how to handle these thoughts 

I would suggest that you take a bit of time each day to collect your thoughts and list what you did well that day at work. Completed a project to a high standard? Write it down! Made sure policies were abided by? Add that to the list! 


Do this as often and as much as you have to. Reward yourself mentally and frequently remind yourself that you are doing well. Also listen to constructive criticism and look at ways to improve. 


Recognising that you are doing well (and actually having a physical list of said achievements!) will help you realise that those people were simply trying to pull you down to build themselves up. Knowing why they acted that way (from a place of insecurity) makes you realise that they were simply trying to blow out your light to make their light that bit brighter. It's about them - not you. Likewise, the list helps you recognise achievement and hopefully builds up your confidence when you can see you're kicking ass!

Thought I was over it in my late teenage years until I fell in with the wrong crowd. I felt different again and it brought it all back. I have a successful life now but the scars are still there. About a year ago I was barely able to even get out of bed. I didn't want my wife an kids to see me so helpless so I simply pushed through it the best I could. Then I prayed and prayed. Asked God for help and admitted I couldn't do it alone, I listened to his nudging, began going to church almost daily and slowly the fog began to lift. I have come to realize the bullying happened to me for a reason. The pain will always be with me but it wasn't my fault. It was God's will that it happened so I could be more sensitive to the plight of others in need of my help. It was NOT your fault. You can learn from it. You can learn to avoid people who are mean and want to hurt you. You don't have to win them over. You can be there for others who are in pain and need of love and help. You can make it your mission to make the world a better place one person at a time. If you are still being bullied go to your parents or a kind adult at school. If it is over but the pain still lingers then seek help, be it from God or a therapist. There is no shame in admitting you need help. Hope this helps.

dr4ci0r,t3_7ikiw0,"Okay. This is a tricky one. Before I start, I was bullied as a child. I now work as a teacher and often with kids on the spectrum. 

There is nothing I can say to fix this, but let's step back. 
First of all, bullies never think they are bullies. Bullies ALWAYS feel they are the victim or are just standing up for themselves. Your son may have said something that was perceived as being rude. Being on the spectrum means he may not have understood a social cue. The other kid probably did react in an inappropriate manner. I have had many many conversations with my students about this. Here's what I have learned about dealing with the adults in the room. 

If you accuse their kid, it will go nowhere. You have lost. Mamma/papa bear instinct is very strong (as I'm sure you know). Do not accuse their kid. Of anything. Like... ever. Instead, frame the situation to make it seem like what the kid did was reasonable (stay with me here, I know this seems crazy right now.) ""Listen, my son doesn't do well with social cues. Is that accurate? I'm worried that something he said may have hurt your kid. The response your kid gave left my son really upset and hurt and I would love to figure out how to keep that from happening again."" 

I cannot express how important that question of ""is that accurate?"" Or ""is that right?"" is in the situation. If they even nod, they are on board and admit that something is messed up and needs fixing. 

I'm guessing you were already nice to her. I'm guessing you didn't specifically blame her son for anything or yell. Her son came home and told his mom that your kid was mean/rude/whatever. That's her starting point. Hell, her kid may have been in tears about it (real or not). 

It's shitty that your kid is going through this. It sucks. This will happen again and again. It happens to everyone. Kids on the spectrum have an especially hard time and I feel for you and your son. Perhaps when it happens again my experience can help a bit. Good luck.

He did not reach out in a kind way. He was a dick. Yeah, you're isn't perfect either but no kid is perfect. If you have evidence of the pics in the locker room, then that is police-calling territory. Seriously. 
Your response makes the bullying sound worse than your initial post. Depends on your country and state, but in the US there are liaisons you can call on to work with the school if you feel action is not being taken. Now if it gets worse, the nuclear option to to hire a lawyer to talk to the school. If you do this (and I don't think you should at this given point) hire one with a background in educational law.

You said in your other post that you face someone who says something bad about you, and when you respond, they spin your response to make you feel bad. Try this: Respond in a way that doesn't fight their dumb comment, but rather deflects it or humors it. In your example, the bully said that you wore a ""nazi jacket"" - think of something that doesn't fight with their opinion. For example, ""Interesting, you may want to report that to [Insert the brand of the jacket],"" or ""Oh well, it looks like I'm a nazi today. What can you do?"" 

While these responses may not seem productive, they should leave the bully speechless, because there is nothing about those statements that they can use to hurt you back. There is no fuel that they can burn in the statements, because the statements do not give the bully energy.

Also, I wouldn't recommend fighting back with insults (for example, ""Well, Chase, you're wearing a KKK jacket"" or something dumb like that), because that gives them something to feed off of. I've found through personal experience that it doesn't work, and is almost as bad as agreeing with them

That is why, bullying can not be ended. The only way to end bullying, is to avoid it. My advice is fitting in with the general population. What I mean by this, is often times bullies target individuals who lack moral understanding and moral principles in modern day society. For example, a person who plays no sports and dyes their pink has a higher chance of being bullied than his/her peers. Basically, what I'm telling you is, even though people are cruel and you most likely hate high school, it would be A LOT better if you try and make friends, join a sport, or fit in with the social normal.",t3_5g6d24

d6nstil,t3_4ygni0,"I was bullied in the same manner in junior high, some 20 something years ago.  It was really bad, as a girl being bullied by a boy, a thug too.  He used to punch, pinch, spit on me, pull my hair when I wore a ponytail (I stopped wearing ponytails since).  He would do this in front of the whole class and the teacher.  I also had a stutter as a kid and it comes out when I get nervous to this day, but not too bad. One day I planned to go to my class 10 minutes early to ask my teacher to move my seat, not his (he sat 2 desks over but there wasn't any one between us).  I went to speak with my teacher and begged her, crying, to please move me  because I was scared of him.  She said she was used to our seating arrangements and didn't want to ruin her seating plan.  I kept begging, even pointing out to her that there was an empty desk on the other side of the room.  The bell rang and I saw him walk in.  I told my teacher to never mind.  Thinking that I would go to the principal.  The teacher called him over!!!  She asked him if he was hurting me!!!  He said ""no of course not!""  It was scary because he said it like he genuinely meant it.  The teacher sent us back to our desks, he ""let"" me go first, after I sat down he grabbed my hair, pulled my head back and told that I just made things much worse for myself.  I know my teacher saw this happened.  It did get worse.  He started kicking me under the desks, tried to stab me with pins or pencils.  

One day, he didn't show up and I felt relaxed and happy that day.  He didn't show up the next day or the next.  He never came back!  I don't know what happened to him.  I never asked about him.  After he left my teacher moved another boy to the now empty desk of my bully. The new guy tried to start bullying me but I think he felt bad and had remorse so he stopped.  I got bullied in high school too by a football player. He once told me that he knew where I lived and could kill me if he wanted to, then laughed.  I was genuinely scared when he told me what color my carpet was in my bedroom.

I have a young son that I worry about.  He has some quirks that have caused him to be picked on already.  Luckily the school my son attends has a no tolerance stance on bullying.  I got a call one day that another boy told my son that he was going to kill him.  The boy has some mental issues and his parents have been told by the school to have it managed or he will be kicked out.  

I also feel like I'm an easy target to be picked on in my adult life.  When people around me laugh after whispering, I feel it's about me and it ruins the rest of my day.  If I meet new people, I never see them again.  They seem to avoid me.",t3_4ygni0
d6o2fhh,t3_4ygni0,"My bully is still a nasty piece of work. Her facebook (we're not friends, she just doesn't know how to set security) is filled with things like charity runs and charity dinners. Regardless, I know from other friends that she's still harassing other people over email and reunion sites (it's been over 25 years since we graduated). Some people are just ugly inside. If she ever pops up in my inbox I'm just going to forward it to the charity groups she brags about supporting.
 
I still have social anxiety when talking to other women who remind me of her. But a lot of that I just forced away when I became a mom. Told my daughter all about it from a very young age (especially since she's pretty and popular), did my best to teach her to both be accepting of other people regardless of their differences, but also not to put up with any shit from other kids. We literally go zero tolerance. In 2nd grade there was a boy who bullied the entire class (physically threatened every single kid, it's like he took turns with them). Little psychopath came up to me at the school when I volunteered and told me how he was friends from my daughter. Then I find out from her that just 20 minutes before he said that he had threatened to beat her up if she didn't play with him. She walked away from him and he followed her saying threatening things and trying to scare away her friends. That's when I started a log and let the teacher and administrators know over their official email that I was tracking everything and it was unacceptable. And low and behold, I got action and they kept the kid away from my daughter, whereas other parents who just complained were not taken seriously. I was ready to go to war and I still will if I need to.
 
And I think that just knowing that, has really helped my daughter. So perhaps that's a huge thing. It's not just the bullying, but also when there are no adults (parents or teachers) in your corner. ",t3_4ygni0
d6s0zi7,t3_4ygni0,My nickname was fagbitch from 4th through 9th grade.  I have low self-esteem and high social anxiety so i usually get pretty trashed at parties.

There are pics. It's pretty funny.,t3_4ygni0
d709mea,t3_4ygni0,"A bit of backstory. I have Autism and I'm also visually impaired so I didn't realise that any of this was bullying until I was 15.

In the second half of Primary school (age 9-11) their were 4 boys (I'm a girl) in particular who would mentally pick on me. They did the whole lot; Called me manes, told others not to play with me/choose me as their partner and one of the boys' mum was a dinner lady so no one knew it was happening. 

In my first 4 years of High school (age 12-16) I had friends and it was a lot better but people talked about me. That was around the time when I realised that I was being bullied so the 7 years of it built up instantly.

Now I'm almost 18. I'm bullied by my younger sister (physically and mentally) but I'm invisible in school. People would enter and leave a room and wouldn't notice my existence. These days I tell myself that being invisible and useless is better than being picked on. At least I have some great friends but they aren't aware of all this. I still think about it all today and wonder what the future holds for me.",t3_4ygni0
d79f14e,t3_4ygni0,"Oh, I was bullied a lot from the third grade up through the eighth. It doesn't help that my first grade teacher was abusive, and then when we moved to a new state, my parents were really stressed and couldn't make time to deal with me fighting with other kids. They had to buy a new house and find my disabled brother a school with a program that suited him, which of course never happened, causing more stress. I was also a very sensitive kid who cried a lot, and most people assumed I did it for attention when in fact it's an anxiety thing.


The thing is that I had both kids and teachers hating me and my family acting like I was blowing the whole thing out of proportion. I gave up in so many ways. I became ""lazy"" and only did the bare minimum of school work. I was interested in clothes and other girly things but also saw them as being a privilege of popular girls, so much that in order to remove any chance of ridicule, I opted for having a selection of identical, plain tees in different colors and plain blue jeans. I didn't wear jewelry or make up. Of course I got called a dyke. I shut down completely in the 8th grade and failed, which ultimately saved me somewhat. My bullies moved on to a new grade without me, and my teachers treated me like I was smart for the first time in my life. Before that, there had been talks of putting me in some kind of animal farm school. I was actually pressured to do that and said no.


I'm in my 30s and fairly successful, though not great. I've had one boyfriend in my entire life and can count the number of times we had sex on one hand, so even though I had a lot of compliments back then and guys would joke he was lucky, I felt like a disgusting failure. I'm no longer interested in that kind of relationship. I discovered a philosophy of personal freedom and value that above all things. I do not leave it up to anyone else to make me happy.


My 20s were horrible, though. I entered college completely unprepared to cope. They say that it gets better, but YOU don't magically get better. I was terribly behind in social skills and felt depressed all the time. I was put on psyche meds, but they failed, leaving me with a nervous breakdown. I left school and spent time with a couple of my friends who were going into the business of being lifetime drug addicts. We separated, and I left for a new town to be with my boyfriend. When I went back to school, he broke up with me, and I was again asked to take psyche meds as I was having panic attacks and depression. Again, that backfired, and I had to drop out AGAIN. The school made it very hard to do so, and as a result, I wasn't able to do it properly and graduated with a very much lowered GPA (and a large bill that my parents helped with, thankfully). Luckily I had enough credits for a degree, but I kicked around in poverty all alone for awhile, stuck in the college town where the rent was cheap and the work hard to find.


I clawed my way out by teaching myself programming and being lucky enough to end up rooming with a really supportive girl who is now a good friend of mine. But, I feel like I lost decades of my life to horseshit that started with some bad kids and a bunch of adults who didn't give a fuck.


My suggestion is to not beat yourself up if you feel like your post-bullying experience doesn't match with what society says. We get a lot of messaging about how we should blossom into social butterflies or become very successful or that at the very least, our lives should have gotten much better. You were abused, and that is an injury to your sense of self. That's not to say you should lean on crutches and complain about being a victim for the rest of your life, but give yourself permission to recognize the injury and work on healing it the same way you would if you broke a bone or something.",t3_4ygni0

This can be seen as a positive or a negative thing, since a victim can interpret this as something that will never really stop, or something that they can stop this very day!

I am now the person who does not ever get bullied, and I observe or interfere with bullies. Sometimes I even bully the bullies into submission. But what I always see is that there's a certain stereotype that always gets picked on. And it's the one that never goes to extremes to stick up for themselves. And those people still get bullied at later stages in life, if they let others bully them. The same goes for bullies, I've met many middle-aged bullies and the sight of how they act is just disgusting.

So yes, bullying can disappear with time as you grow up. But it'll only disappear for you while another person who was damaged too much by bullying will just continue to be bullied. And bullies don't often change their attitude as they age.",t3_45a2gm

czaljz1,t1_czakkxv,"Ok, so some other questions:
 
How old are you approximately?  Is this a high school?  Public or private?  (Where This is happening makes a big difference)
 
Have you told your parents? Are they supportive of you?  Do you have other supportive adults in your life? (Tells us your resources)
 ",t3_42hmby
czamx56,t1_czaljz1,I am 17 years old and go to a public high school. I haven't told my parents because I fear they will confront the teacher and he will treat me even worse. I am planning on talking to another teacher or faculty member first.,t3_42hmby
czb6l0h,t1_czamx56,"Ok, so some of the classic advice is to yes, go up the chain of command. Start with a faculty member that you trust, if nothing good happens, then the assistant principal, and then the principal. At some point you will likely need your parents involved because unfortunately administration will often listen more to parents than to students.  They will not approach this like a swat team. No matter who brings the issue to them, at best when they approach the teacher they won't mention specific whistle blowers. At worst they will. Either way, it is likely the teacher will step up abuse in an effort to stymie the telling.
 
The biggest thing is to document everything.  Keep a running list of dates, times, and exactly what happened. The phrase you will hear a lot is that you want to ""establish a pattern"" of abusive behavior. This is the bureaucracy of the system, but it's also a professional way to go about it and it really can make a huge difference. And if you do tell your parents, they confront, and it gets worse (while the teacher likely tries to gaslight you) you need to be on that with the documentation and the telling of the other adults immediately.
 
What I have found in public schools is that it's often all about embarrassing the right person to get any action on complaints.  Administrations will often try to downplay bullying of any sort until you get the parent (or kid) who brings it to outside parties, like brings it up at a public school board meeting, or even sends a tip to the local news tipline. You kinda have to get creative, and you also have to steel yourself when dealing with your bully in question. Remember the end goal. Unfortunately ""it's a process"" and usually the most immediate action that is taking is that someone will talk to the teacher...  unless there have been other complaints.
 
I have to head out to work but I'll try and find an Illinois resource for you (most states have their own tip lines for essentially reporting problems like these within individual schools -we've been using ours recently on account of a problematic principal who covered up violent threats made to other students by one transfer student in my child's elementary school).",t3_42hmby
czbgajr,t1_czb6l0h,This means so much to me that you are helping. Thanks again for the support.,t3_42hmby
czbu8f8,t1_czbgajr,"I wish I had more power in this kind of area. School is hard enough. You shouldn't be put in a helpless position and manipulated just because you're under 18.
 
Ok, so I think you (and any friends who want to participate) should compile a list of things that happened and their dates to the best of your memory.  That's going to be  living document (update it every time something happens) that you are going to use as a basis for everything else.  Yes, they will say that it carries more weight if you attach your names to it, but in this case I think it's totally acceptable to do this anonymously too; you can even state you are doing it nameless to avoid retribution by said teacher.  Should you go this route, I would even include a line: ""Please interview students of this class about their individual experiences while {teacher name} is not in the room and you will find the same issues across the class.""
 
Now, what to do with this.  Certainly use it if you have discussions with faculty and/or administration about it. Other things:

1) It's a big step, but you can try to get the Illinois State Board of Ed Licensing Dept. involved.  Make a complaint of unprofessional and unethical conduct (also called ""educator misconduct"").  [Here is the complaint form](http://www.isbe.net/EMP/default.htm#complaint).  -So go there, pull up the form (.pdf), email it to the address given.  If you are staying anonymous, set up another google, yahoo, or other email address (you'll see that your name is an optional field on the form).  Keep it as short and sweet as possible. They don't need all details. They need specific bullet points and definitely include the words ""emotional manipulation"", ""intimidation"", ""threats of retribution if complaints are made"".
 
At the very very least this will go in the teacher's file for when they renew their license. It can also be cause for an immediate investigation into misconduct. And if the teacher is already on any kind of probation then this will be a definite push for disciplinary action.
 
Here is the [Illinois Educator Code of Ethics](http://www.isbe.net/prep-eval/pdf/meetings/emag/pdf/educator_COE_0311.pdf). I know it's a bit of homework, but get to know this. This is essentially a legal document that can be used in your defense. If possible, quote this when making complaints.
 
Here is [a contact form for the school board itself](http://webprod1.isbe.net/contactisbe/). I would inquire about who to contact when dealing with teacher misconduct and intimidation. No guarantee that they'll respond back. Illinois has a bad tack record for this, but definitely a place to try. You want to become annoying.
 
Finally, if you try a number of pathways towards resolution of this and nothing works (especially if this tips the teacher off and he goes on the warpath), again, document everyone you contacted about these issues along with the issues, and see if the local news tiplines will bite.  Likewise in your shoes I'd contact Stand for the Silent. They work with bullied kids, so surely they've had this scenario come up before.
 
I know it's daunting, but you need to be the fly in the ointment. If I can find you anyone's direct phone number I'll definitely report back with that. So far it's not so easy... Illinois is a much larger district than what I deal with where I'm at. If you're from a smaller city you can try and find the district contact info for that place (or feel free to pm me with the city and I'll see what I can find).
 
But you shouldn't have to deal with this crap.",t3_42hmby

cria5i6,t3_35vxzv,"This is a late response. 

Immediately file a police a report and have it documented. Kicks to the back is extremely dangerous, since your child's spine can be injured and this can lead to long term medical issues.

Then go to the school and demand to know what they will do to resolve this immediately and have a plan shown to you in writing and when you expect the school to execute this plan. Having a plan in writing allows you to voice any issues and also makes the school accountable if they don't follow up exactly. 

If the school doesn't want to give you a written plan, then threaten to escalate the issue with the police, threaten to notify the local news station that the school did nothing to take care of this bullying problem for a long time and threaten a civil lawsuit against the school district. If the school doesn't resolve this issue, then actually call the local news station and contact a lawyer. 

This will light a fire under the principal's behind to get this issue fixed immediately, because now the school's reputation and his/her own career is now on the line. It is the school's responsibility to keep your child safe during school hours.

catsv4m,t3_1gpm7v,"I'm sorry you experienced this. It is interesting that you bring up Erika's family and her troubles in her home, it shows that you understand where her bullying tendencies may come from and means that you are able to empathize with her and where she's coming from. Still, it doesn't change the fact that she treated you poorly. Kids can be really mean, and during that egocentric time it's hard for them to understand the pain they cause others, let alone the ramifications of their negative actions. I'm sorry her actions still stick with you, but if you recognize that you let people bully you around, it's important to make a change, instead of approaching future relationships with the mentality of a victim. Remember that you are the primary actor in your life, and act accordingly. It may be difficult, but a key aspect of our teaching at Take Ten is being assertive--taking control of your life in a way that isn't passive or aggressive, but in a way that removes anger from the equation and helps you act rationally. You must keep that in mind with your relationships. You are in charge, and anyone who treats you poorly doesn't deserve your time and effort in terms of friendship. Hope this helps. ",t3_1gpm7v

c349bo6,t3_mv7po,"First off, your English is pretty good.  So don't worry about that.  

I know that ignoring bullies is a very difficult, so that is not a very realistic option IMO.  Try letting adults know what is going on, and they may be able to stop it from happening by intervening.  

If that fails, standing up to him is probably the only way that I can think of that will make it stop.  Don't get violent with him, just let him know that you will not take his shit anymore.  For me, I was just as dickish to them as they were to me, and that generally got them to stop.",t3_mv7po

c3egg7w,t3_mv7po,"I'm 14 as well, and I used to get called names a lot by this guy in my year. I used to just laugh at him whenever he did it. Make him feel like he said something really idiotic and eventually he will stop.",t3_mv7po
c3emmoc,t3_mv7po,"You'll pull through this. A lot of people don't seem to understand just how painful names can be.

Tell one of your teachers that it's upsetting you and making you feel uncomfortable. They may be able to give you advice or just keep an extra eye out for you. Does your best friend know what's going on? Depending on his personality, maybe try talking to him and letting him know that you find it uncomfortable to be around this person.

Ignoring can be very difficult, but if you act as if it doesn't bother you that can help stop people, and then confide in a teacher or parents. Build your confidence, find a hobby you're good at. Excelling and becoming more confident is a great way of getting bullies off you back.

And another thing: Nerd? Geek? Those are actually pretty good characteristics. What it shows is that you're smart. Determined. Good at what you do. Try viewing them as compliments. He's lashing out because he's jealous that you have drive and can do well. Geek is a massive compliment once you get older (I'm at University and we're proud to be geeks). Pale? Nothing wrong with that, paler skin is much more attractive to some people. Attacking you based on your appearance? Yes, that hurts. But there must be something he feels threatened by. If you can, try and think about how a lot of the things these people say are actually compliments in another social situation and they're just trying to deal with a percieved threat.

It does get easier as you get older. If you need to talk you can PM me/talk to me on here. I've been through it and came out the other side.

Best of luck.",t3_mv7po

And you might be right. Maybe they would side with your parents. But at least there would be a record of you filing a complaint. I know it would be a problem obviously living in the same house with your parents and filing a complaint. Now that would be difficult. But, believe me I DO understand. However, you are 21 and having to deal with this situation is probably making you very stressed which affects many things  you are probably aware of and many more that you are not aware of. If you are at a four-year college, have you checked out dorm rooms? I can‚Äôt imagine still being 21 and having one of my siblings still beating up on me. Yes, I was 21 a long time ago.

Maybe because you sound much more mature than you would otherwise if you were under 18. I don‚Äôt know. Anyway, your situation keeps you in a psychological state of perpetual adolescence. Regardless of any of this, if you really want to get out of there, the fact is, and it IS a fact, you will find a way. For some people, things have to get so bad before they‚Äôll make any move. It‚Äôs usually due to fear. Right now as I‚Äôm writing this I can think of at least 10 ways for you to be able to get out of there without having to live on the streets.

But you are right there is a way somehow, and much more research would have to be done since many things are unknown for me.

People act out when they‚Äôre afraid, and maybe that was how your classmates dealt with 9/11, by bullying you as a means to cope. It wasn‚Äôt right what they did to you, and others like you. Their anger, though justified, was grossly misdirected at you.

https://www.who.int/search?query=bullying&page=1&pagesize=10&sort=relevance&sortdir=desc&default=AND&f.Countries.size=100&f.Lang.filter=en&f.RegionalSites.size=100&f.Topics.size=100&f.contenttype.size=100&f.doctype.size=101&facet.field=RegionalSites&facet.field=Topics&facet.field=doctype&facet.field=Countries&facet.field=contenttype&facet.field=Lang&tune=true&tune.0=3&tune.1=2&tune.2=2&tune.3=3&tune.4=180&tune.5=75

.. But i dont know what department. I think it might be a subsection under teen and adolescent issues. Or ""youth violence""

If you are a student and managed to find some volunteer or internship with WHO, that would possibly be an outstanding experience.

Don't be afraid to just call or email and ask, even if theres no obvious contact. Sometimes opportunity is created where none existed before, if people can see you are motivated. Good luck.

f7b6ael,t1_f79n71y,"The thing is though is that bullies tend to devalue others for many reasons, sometimes its how they ""excuse"" their actions, sometimes its the endgame method.  However, I found there are some very generic methods of bullies use.  This guy is definitely the classic lack of value bully.  He lacks confidence and personal value.  So he rips on the value of others in the simplest way possible to get his fix.  

One of the best anti-bullying methods I found was holding proper personal value and for this guy, it's no different.  The thing is that people like him are addicted to the emotional rush so he will also double down due to desperation so you will need a defense for that as well.  

Laugh at your flaws, show you don't need him or others to create validation, so then when he doubles down you have ammunition as well.  

Good luck and I hope you tell him what for so to speak.",t3_durfjy

f6rng0n,t3_dsswzq,"First, you should keep telling your techers what is going on. You should tell your parents, and your school counsellor. If no one helps you, keep telling adults, including the principal.

If you think other people are being bullied by them you should all complain, and keep it up even if they don't seem to take it seriously at first. Sometimes adults don't take things seriously unless there are multiple complaints, and from multiple people. Adults suck like that but thats how it is. 

You and your friend should make detailed notes of did who did things, what they did, what they said. Your friend should tell them to stop, and what they did in response. Write down exact quotes of what they said, especially if its racist. 

If people don't believe you, or accuse you of lying, and you live in the United states, and you can afford it, it might be worth it to try to record what the bullys say or do to you. However, in some states, it is illegal to record people without them knowing. You should find out what the law is where you live before you do this. Always get the help of an adult if you can. 

If you are feeling brave, and the situation fits.. You could try to talk to them and ask them what their problem is. You could even suggest they get some counseling because they seem upset or angry.

If the bullying is recent, you could try to avoid them or ignore them sometimes bullies just get bored and move on. 

If you physically attack them first its likely you will get in trouble. Avoid this, if you can. 

Most of all stay safe and don't put yourself in danger.

Thats all i can think of for now. Hopefully others will have better ideas than me!",t3_dsswzq
f6v9en8,t3_dsswzq,"Plan an attack, here is an idea that you can use:

Tell your friend that you will hide in a stall while he pretends to leave one than go pretends to wash his hands a long time until the bullies show up, come out of your and yell at them to leave them alone or you'll beat them up if they say no beat them up (go for the face, in between the legs, the stomach, etc)",t3_dsswzq
f7bqpz9,t3_dsswzq,"Okay, hey. 

Firstly, no violence. You‚Äôre in 8th grade. Come on, don‚Äôt get yourself in trouble.
Secondly, you sound like a great friend wanting to help. At least you‚Äôre not letting it happen like is often the case. You‚Äôre a true friend. Please give your friend lots of love and reassure them that there is nothing wrong with them etc and that you like them how they are. They don‚Äôt deserve this. Please watch out for him at school and INTERVENE if he‚Äôs targeted by the horrible kids again. There‚Äôs a thing called the bystander effect which is where people just stand and watch and even if they like the person being picked on, they just stay quiet and completely let it happen. Being a true friend is sticking up for him if he gets teased. Being a bystander is almost as bad as helping the bully, and in a way it 100% is helping because it adds to the atmosphere/embarassment etc and your friend will feel betrayed. 
I‚Äôm really glad you want to help your friend. What I would suggest is telling a teacher. Now I know what you‚Äôre thinking but hear me out for a second. Teachers are usually kind and nice and you could say about your friend being picked on. Trust me, your friend doesn‚Äôt need to know. That sounds like you‚Äôre doing it behind his back, but it‚Äôs totally okay. A teacher could then just keep an eye out for it and just be alert to it. 
When I was bullied, my mum and I told the headteacher, and I was worried I would be called out for being a snitch, but the bullies didn‚Äôt know because the headteacher didn‚Äôt immediately take action, but instead just alerted other teachers it was happening, so they all kept an eye out. And then when the teachers witnessed it themselves they obviously got the kids in trouble and I was relieved. And it wasn‚Äôt like I snitched at all. Teachers just want to help you. 
I really hope the situation improves (and it will). 
Honestly, my bullies wouldn‚Äôt have eventually stopped if I didn‚Äôt tell the school, so that is highly recommended. 

I hope this helps. Good luck!",t3_dsswzq
f7brzum,t3_dsswzq,"This is what COULD happen ideally if the two of you tell a teacher. 

You tell the teacher, they should take it very seriously because there is a zero tolerance for bullying policy at all schools. 

Your friend can do the talking but you go for moral support (unless they just want to speak to your friend). 

Give them the names of the bullies. They will take notes and write what each one does summed up because sometimes people bully in different ways (I was bullied by 6 people at once who all had a different way of bullying me). 

Express your concerns about being called a ‚Äòsnitch‚Äô, getting in trouble for telling a teacher etc. They have worked in schools for years, they will understand. They won‚Äôt do anything yet.

Aim to have it appear to the bullies that OTHER PEOPLE reported the bullying and not the victim. Yes it‚Äôs a lie but it‚Äôs the best thing to do. I know with bystanders, it may be hard for the bully to believe that someone reported it. Everyone in the room may laugh a long at the time, so the bully may think it could only have been the victim.

A teacher will notice the teasing (because they‚Äôll keep a watchful eye out) and will confront the bullies. A senior staff member like the Headteacher or Deputy Head can drag them into their office and have strict words and say ‚ÄúI know you are bullying (name).‚Äù 

Agree it with the headteacher that they can say to the bully ‚Äúsome students overheard you picking on him‚Äù or ‚Äúone of my teachers saw‚Äù. It will never be made out to be you guys, but of course it will be; report bullying every time it happens. The same DAY. Take note, get it reported. The teacher helping will go about it with discretion don‚Äôt worry. 

When your headteacher speaks to the bully they can say ‚ÄúIf I hear you spoke to (name) again you will be in trouble.‚Äù 

The moment it happens, your friend reports it in straight away, and they‚Äôre in the office again. It took a long time for my bullying to stop but it did eventually and it wouldn‚Äôt have stopped without this teacher shouting at the kids for me and being like ‚Äúwe do not have bullying in my school!‚Äù

I'm sorry you're going through this and i understand completely. I've been through these experiences myself. The only thing you can do now is look for new people who like being around you. I know it's very easy to say than to actually do, especially since you're shy. I also know that it's even more difficult since you've been hanging with these people since high school, so it can be hard to let go.

f2szl8i,t3_de7eyz,"I agree somewhat. My problem with this approach is that bullying is not just manipulation of you by the bully, but also manipulation of your environment. It's great to not value the opinions of assholes and cunts, the problem starts really when other people do value their opinion, and then treat the victim accordingly. Because often enough, it's not one bully, it's several, the instigator and his friends, and the consequenses can be that people become afraid of hanging with the victim, because of the attached reputation or threat.

Not valuing the words of said cunts and assholes is great, and it definitely is a tool, but it's not the whole toolbox.",t3_de7eyz
f2udvws,t1_f2szl8i,"Great point. I agree with you there! 

And that's what makes bullying so bad, they're able to manipulate your environment and turn others against you in order to maintain control of you. This happened to me on several occasions when I was in middle and high school. 

However, if possible, avoid the bullies and anyone who agrees with their pathetic rhetoric. 

If the bullies are that good at manipulating a social infrastructure, you can bet that you aren't the first or only one who has fallen victim. These bullies have had years of practice on many, many innocent people before you. My advice would be to find out who these other victims are, (because, trust me, they're out there!) then befriend and align yourself with them. 

Not only will you have something in common with the other victims and will easily make them your allies, but there is strength in numbers and most bullies are great, big cowards at heart. You will never see a bully running alone. Bullies usually get their power from an entourage and prefer to catch you alone. But they will always back off anytime you're with a group.

f2el47z,t3_dd1nob,"Sometimes people saying mean things hurts you, even if you know that they do not know you personally. That's okay. The way to toughen up in a situation like this is not to declare your hurt invalid because you know they didn't mean it, it's to accept your hurt, and understanding that being hurt happens sometimes. And next time, you won't react that strongly, because you know yourself better. The pain is always the same, your reaction to it changes. Like in boxing. The 1000th time being hit in the face really isn't all that spectacular anymore.

From then on, complain to the director, council, school board, go up the chain.

Now, if you find them sharing images of your brothers head edited onto naked bodies, you can call the cops right away, because I think that has a good chance of sticking as distributing pornographic images of a minor.

If that is the case tho, DO NOT SAVE ANY IMAGES. Otherwise you can be had for posession. Share links to it at maximum.

Somewhere you will get help. There is service to help woth bullying. Search for help untio you find it. Going through this alone like i did is risky. I got out of my past save but it was really some kind of hell with these bullies that keep trying to mentally break you. Don't take all of this alone. I mean i assume you are not an adult.

It is a waste of time but of course they will keep picking on you so best thing is to dit back, get help like here in reddit posting is the first step. I did not do that during my times of beong bullied but in real life look for help and think this through calmly. Don't do something you could regret later on.",t3_d5chab
f0oxbr8,t3_d5chab,"Bullying is an effective strategy for getting ahead in life, so long as you don't have too many other bullies to compete with in your community.  You can get ahead in life by being nice and helpful, building trust and gratitude.  Or you can take what you want by intimidation and deceit.  Either strategy can backfire.  If you're a nice guy, some people will take advantage of you.  If you're an asshole, you'll make enemies.

Bullying exists because it *works*, and consequently natural selection preserves the characteristic in the human gene pool.  Bullies are in the minority.  You'd think that humans, as social creatures, would have eliminated these anti-social types from the gene pool by now, but the fewer bullies there are in a population the more profitable bullying becomes (fewer wolves to compete with means more sheep for yourself), and therefore evolution selects for it more strongly and you get a sort of equilibrium where there is always a minority of bullies in every population.",t3_d5chab

I had a similar situation when ins secondary school but I was way younger about 11 12 we start secondary early and I don't know who exactly started a rumor that I was lesbian (I am not but so what if I was) it was horrible that even teachers stopped talking to me and some were trying to change me but they never made it obvious just casually saying if I fancy guys anyway it lasted for 2 3 years then they shifted it to a slut that sucks dick didn't really care about that cause it was sort of true but the whole because I happen to be a girl was stupid anyway even after the whole slut thing I was still the lesbian then things calmed down 

And people saw it as a joke and told me do you remember when we said you were a lesbian THEY SAID WE SAID so they knew it was a lie anyway I didn't have the confidence back then to tell them it ruined me and now its over cause I'm out of school.

Sometimes we adults create situations in the world that are pretty messed up. The situation for kids in a home where they're dealing with abuse is one of those situations. We don't have a good safety net in place for kids like you. The system that does exist is one that lots of kids feel traumatized by, when they do go through it. And the other part of that is, because social workers know that, they like to keep kids in the home lots of times--which seems to be what you want, as you say there's an awesome loving part of your dad, and he's provided a nice home for you--but you also seem aware that just calling them over to have a talk with your parent can make some parents pretty mad. It's definitely a tough situation. 

Is there any way you and your sister can spend more time playing outside, or somehow put some space between your dad and you (and sis) for most of the day? You don't deserve to be treated that way. And don't ever feel guilty about what you're feeling about this! Emotional and verbal abuse are not less damaging than rape or physical assault is, that's actually a myth. Society may see physical injuries as worse, but science shows your brain & body see emotional/verbal abuse as just as bad. And those of us who have lived through it don't need science to tell us how bad it hurts. It just does. 

Please give us an update and let us know how you're doing. Also you might want to crosspost to other subreddits like r/emotionalabuse , r/verbalabuse, r/socialworkers, r/AskParents to get perhaps some other perspectives, maybe some advice, but also perhaps some support and to see you're not alone.

I was abused physically and mentally for most of of my young adult. ^my credentials 

I'm really happy that you posted before deciding to do anything. I feel you, your situation sounds so unbelievably complicated. I also must say that you are suprisingly self aware for a 12 year old.

Look bottom line, what he's doing is not right. Also never ever ever EVER ever ever blame yourself for his abusive. He is a grown man and has a different set of responsibilities than you do. That being said it sounds like is in a lot of pain. He's spreading that pain to you and your sisters. Your mental state is result of that. Not all abuse is physical. But I'm really happy to hear he's not hitting you, even though its mental abuse that leaves the longesr lasting damage.

The way you feel about your dad being the best..
Yeh dude i felt the same way about my dad growing up. Thats what makes the abuse so unbearable. How can someone you love so much cause you so much pain.

Whats the deal with like aunts and uncles ? You need to have another adult on your team that you trust implicitly to represent and serve as a barrier. Maybe they can convince him to get therapy and meanwhile you and sis can live with them. Also you should be open to therapy. Its a must. I tried to fight the damage on my own for many years, its really fucking hard. Also, if you dont like, don't give up keeping looking for one that you connect with.

I was taken away from my grandparents when I was 3 and I genuinely always had fond memories. But then when I would try to think about anything involving my grandfather in particular all I could remember was play wrestling. And only one little short instance of it. As I grew older, I knew in the back of my mind that something bad had happened to me but I was never able to connect the dots. When I was in like 6th grade, I went to my adopted mom crying, and asked her if I‚Äôd ever been raped as a child. What a weird question for a kid to ask right?

&nbsp;

>She told me no, and made me feel like I was a crazy. She made fun of me and laughed and overall just made me feel stupid and paranoid for thinking that. Well when I turned 18, I found out that I had indeed, not been crazy. I got my records and there was some horrible shit in there. Really gut wrenching stuff. I was so ashamed and humiliated and mad at myself for not listening to my gut and I ended up burning the papers as soon as I was done reading it bc I didn‚Äôt want anyone to see me in that light, ever. My boyfriend knows now, as we have been together 3 years, but I remembered something just now while I was watching a therapist on YouTube, that is just depressing and I don‚Äôt want to burden him.

&nbsp;

>I remember being around 4, and people around me talking about how my brothers and I got split up because of what happened. My heart just fractured. I was the oldest. 3,2,1. (Also who abuses children that age? Monsters, that‚Äôs who) Anyway I just felt so guilty and disgusting even though I couldn‚Äôt even remember what happened. The closest thing I could remember to what happened is when I had to sometimes change their diapers, and even at that age I knew something deeper and darker was going on. I tried to tell my therapist that I thought I‚Äôd been raped when I was 6 or 7.

&nbsp;

>It was really hard for me. And my therapist told my mother. And my mother told me and my therapist that I was a liar, that I hadn‚Äôt, I was attention seeking, manipulative. When she knew. She had all my paperwork. I‚Äôll never understand why she had to deny me the privilege of being able to work through my actual issues, instead of the ones she would mirror onto me.

g0vx1na,t3_i6f2p4,"Okay, let me start off by saying, I completely understand where you're coming from regarding DHS. I went through very similar things, and DHS meddled in my life far more than necessary and not in the ways they were supposed to. With that being said, is your sister taking your brothers at the same time as you? If so, yes. Go. You don't want your parents to redirect their anger at your brothers, so as soon as all of you can go, take that opportunity.

If your parents call DHS, it will be a can of worms, but for the better. They will ultimately be shown why they are in the wrong and your sister can apply through them to be your foster mother. That's what my grandparents did and it worked. The program is quick and she would get paid to take care of you, which is nice. If you were concerned about costs, that might alleviate some of them. Then she could easily apply to be the foster for all 3 of you, and you would be together. Also. The whole 14 years of my life that DHS messed with, and years of foster care, my brother and I were never separated. They do try to keep siblings together.

I know the unknown is scary. But you and your brothers will be better off with your sister. Your parents are not behaving like parents and this could easily lead to a court taking away their parental rights (making it so that they cannot claim you legally at all or force you to do anything) and hand you guys over to your sister. Courts favor responsible adults, and since your sister is engaged, that helps too. DHS also appreciates responsible adults. But no matter what, they appreciate being able to boss people around. So in the event that DHS may be called, just make sure you all tell them that you want to be with your sister, you do not feel safe with your parents. And make sure your sister does what they tell her, no matter how dumb or frustrating because then you'll be much more likely to be placed with her.

I'm so sorry this happened to you ‚ô° I so hope it works out and you can salvage what's left of your childhood and start doing things because you want to, not because you have to. Please give us updates. I hope everything works out. I don't pray so I'll be sending love your way ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",t3_i6f2p4

fz0hmnn,t3_hwkirt,Reading this now and I‚Äôm going to respond with some advice but I want you to know someone is reading this. But it‚Äôs gonna take me a minute to write this up. I went through very similar things.,t3_hwkirt
fz0jmkd,t3_hwkirt,"Okay so number one and you‚Äôre not gonna like this. You do not need the tarot cards and in the state you are in it is not healthy to use them. They are make believe and when you are sad you might rely on their ‚Äúanswers‚Äù causing even more grief and anxiety. Do yourself a favor let your mom keep them.

I am 27 years old and my mother was very similar to yours. However she is a diagnosed sociopath. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs what your mom is but she is not treating you like a daughter but someone she takes out her anger on. You clearly need to go to a therapist because as you mentioned you‚Äôre sad and typically stay in your room. I did too at your age which I assume is under the age of 18. Instead of doing that she is fake hitting you to get a reaction etc etc. then biting you. 

I know it is hard but you need to tell another adult close to you what she is doing. Calm yourself down and brainstorm who to talk to. She is emotionally and physically abusing you which is highly illegal. Know that what your mother is doing is WRONG AND ILLEGAL. I‚Äôll talk to her myself if you want and I‚Äôll tell her to her face what she‚Äôs doing is evil and wrong so let me know. 

You deserve so much better than this. You deserve a happy home, kind loving parents and a great life. 

Until you choose to talk to someone my best advice is to ignore her completely. Obviously be polite and do what she says but you must understand people with these mental conditions YOU MUST TREAD LIGHTLY around them. She is most likely waiting for you to do something to annoy her so she can react. I feel horrible telling a teenager this but if you‚Äôre already dealing with it you must know. You seem like a sweet kid who is just trying to do their thing and you have this dragon lady breathing down your neck making your life unbearable.

My mother would do the fake hit thing also and react in the exact same manner. Except at one point she did hit me so badly I couldn‚Äôt move the next day. As a matter of fact I was unable to hold up my head for two weeks straight. My mother was beautiful and would convince others that her kids were awful and she was a damsel in distress as a single parent. So far from the truth. She took all of her anger out on my brothers and I. My brothers are around your age now and their lives are destroyed prematurely because they refused to tell CPS the truth about what she was doing to them.  You need to tell an adult who can help you before this woman destroys your mind and your life.

You are a kid you‚Äôre only job is school and being a kid. Being happy, learning how to be kind and make friends. This however is not at all what you should be dealing with dear.

Please tell an adult you trust and if you would like help contacting social services let me know I can give you numerous websites with people who will help.

There are also hotlines you can call and these people will not tell anyone if you tell them not to but are there to talk and offer advice.

Please take photos of the bite marks and show them to a trusted adult or police. That is horrific abuse and the fake hitting is very similar to gaslighting. She is not a nice woman. 

Bless you and I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening. Know IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT. You have the whole world ahead of you believe that and she is jealous. Do not let her fool you and ruin your life. Once you are away from her these feelings will eventually disappear I promise.

Good luck and if you ever need advice please please let me know as I‚Äôd be so happy to help.

Also one last thing to add. I felt so much guilt whenever I would tell others what my mom was doing. Please don‚Äôt ever feel guilt for telling people the things she does. I wanted to make sure to include this incase you were feeling that way too. Please speak to police, a trusted family or friend or social services",t3_hwkirt
fz0kepx,t3_hwkirt,"Okay I just saw the bite mark. Alright dear you need to call the police now please. That is so awful. Please call the police I will be on standby I can do anything you need to help.

Bless your heart I am so so sorry she did this to you",t3_hwkirt
fzgfefm,t3_hwkirt,"If you‚Äôre at hospital, I hope your bite mark heels up. It‚Äôs disappointing to see that.",t3_hwkirt
fz0mgc9,t1_fz0jmkd,"Thank you so much for this. For once I actually feel seen in this situation. I do agree with you on the tarot thing as well, maybe my mind was trying to distance the feeling of being deathly afraid to say  the cards felt that way. I'm so sorry about your brothers, and I deeply relate with them as the mere mention of CPS scares the living daylights out of me.

She tells me a lot that if I dont like living with her then I should tell the people at my school but will say that since the foster system down here is so full that I will go to Presley Ridge which she has told me is like a juvenile detention center. As of writing this in all actuality it is residential area. She has also called my great aunt to see if she would take me. That wouldn't be an issue if Shella (her name) didn't allow my grandmother to neglect me for almost 12 years as my mom was considered to be too ill to take care of me.

It's also odd how she says that if she leaves me my problems won't go away, but when I lived with a friend of hers for a few weeks after a incident I felt much happier and the feeling of being afraid wasn't there anymore. She's also said that I probably won't be able to hold down a job this summer because of the fact that I will be criticized. It feels like she forgets that I am in a lot of literature actives where I have had pieces I've loved to bits torn to shreds infront of everyone when it came to criticism time. I also think she doesn't realize that she wouldn't be my boss, that the boss wouldn't get in my face and yell at me and say that they can take care of this whole store without me.

Just like your mom, mine is a single mom as well. Funny how we seem to be so similar and yet in completely different places in life and probably the world.",t3_hwkirt
g13cjsd,t1_fz0jmkd,You. Are. A. Good. Human.,t3_hwkirt
fz0nida,t1_fz0mgc9,"You seem so sweet it makes me want to cry. I am so sorry she‚Äôs telling you so many lies. And you know my parents would say the same foster care thing to me except it went a little like this
‚ÄúYou can tell your teachers what we did, they won‚Äôt believe you but if they do, I‚Äôm best friends with the head of cps in Chicago and they will put you in a juvenile detention center‚Äù
They would then take me to ‚Äúthe juvi‚Äù to see what it looked like yet later I found out it was actually just an ugly apartment building in the ghetto. They never took me to a juvi. Just scare tactics.
The foster care system would NEVER put you in a juvenile detention center unless you were considered to be a danger to others. Which I highly doubt you are a danger to anyone. 

I do have a question because my mother didn‚Äôt allow me to see my grandpa for 10 years knowing how much I loved him, it may be a possibility your grandma isn‚Äôt neglecting you rather your mother has said things to keep her away. I thought my grandpa didn‚Äôt love me and was neglecting me too and I called him at 18 he started crying because he missed me so much, call your grandmother and your aunt and tell them what‚Äôs happening. I understand if you‚Äôre afraid to call CpS as it‚Äôs a bad system but your aunt I am sure will come get you in a heartbeat.

Your mother needs you more than you need her at this point. But know you don‚Äôt ever need that in your life. Not today not tommorow not ever. You‚Äôre going to have a great life first step is getting away from her. 

I‚Äôm so glad you felt heard. And like I said you ever need help or advice I have a ton regarding this as I had to deal with it for many many years but now I live 3000 miles away from my mother have a nice boyfriend and things seem a ok. So know everything will get so much better.

Also because you had to deal with this know you are going to be such a strong person in the future. No one will ever stand in your way because you will have the ability to smell evil and nonsense a mile away.",t3_hwkirt
fy8hgtg,t3_hs42ny,"Hey. Writing this out must've been tough. I'm sorry this all happened to you, I can only imagine the pain you're still going through. It breaks my heart that a parent who should love their child unconditionally could do this, and that you weren't shown the love and respect you deserve. Being told to grow up must've been so painful to hear, it angers me so much no one stood up for you... I'm glad things are okey now between your sister and you. I also have places I still can't go back to because there's trauma attached to it, but that's okey. We don't have to back there. Only when we're ready, whenever that may be. And please don't apologise for anything, nothing of this is you fault. You are not annoying me, you are telling your story and to me that's incredibly brave. Abuse doesn't necessarily have to be physical to be just as bad. Abuse is abuse, no matter if the perpetrators are parents, (half) siblings, or classmates... Your story is just as valid as any other. No child should ever have to go through such things, and no adult should ever have to carry that burden. If I could, I'd lift it off of your shoulders. But you can heal, even if it's just baby steps. You deserve so so much better than that. You are worthy of love and respect. Thank you for sharing. üíõ",t3_hs42ny

It‚Äôs not your voice nor your fault, you‚Äôre a human who was disrespected and taught shame. You will not feel this shame today. You will identify the shame as a cultivation of a maladapted and sad adult parent. It is not your fault you didn‚Äôt get what you need and you deserve more. You will be content and satisfied today.

fvtzqsr,t3_hej5s6,"This is awful and I wish I could give you some advice. I was quite suicidal when I was 11 and I know how distressing it is to have to deal with things you are too young for. Maybe you should ask for advice from somewhere like kids helpline, I was always too scared to call them when I was your age but I wish I had (maybe they could have helped me realise my mother was abusive). Its not fair for your dad to treat you this way, no matter how grown up you feel, you're still just a kid (trust me). None of this is your fault.",t3_hej5s6
fwnw1xz,t3_hej5s6,"Hey kiddo, I'm sooo sad to hear you're going through this. 

It sounds like your dad really has some person issues, which could be mental health issues, or could be something about his personality, whether that's something called a personality disorder, or he's just very controlling and doesn't want to hear any contradictions or opinions from you. No matter what is the case, it's not your responsibility or even possible for you to make him behave in a different way. One strategy is just try to agree with him when you have to be around him, do what he says if he's advising you to do a chore or something, and other than that, try to keep some distance away from him. I grew up with a dad who was verbally and emotionally abusive and who'd frequently argue with me, or engage me in long talks which were extremely negative and distressing, and which basically consisted of him telling me a list of things that were wrong with me. I always just wanted my dad to love me and spend time with me in a positive, loving way, until I was maybe around 12 or 13.  The hole in your heart where a parent's loving support should've been, never really goes away, even in adulthood. However as you get older, you can focus more on building relationships up outside of your family. I know that's hard during Covid, but I would focus on exploring more about what's new and awesome about YOU as you are now growing into an adolescent with a more complex and adult-like personality, capacities, thought-processes, and hopes and goals for your life. Things I felt were awesome to explore at your age were music, books and literature, astrology, discovering great old movies and TV shows I'd never heard of, and (since I was a kid in an abusive and toxic household) I also loved self-help and psychology! 

According to [this article](https://www.verywellmind.com/best-online-therapy-for-kids-4800984), this site  [https://www.7cups.com/](https://www.7cups.com/)  has mental health chat rooms for young people, and trained volunteers to be there to listen and support you (I'm not sure how good any of it is, but it could be worth a shot). 

I've been looking around for help for you, and came across this article (there is some religious language though in case that bothers you)  [https://blossomtips.com/how-to-survive-abusive-parents-cant-leave-home/](https://blossomtips.com/how-to-survive-abusive-parents-cant-leave-home/)  It seems to have some good advice, plus what I love is its recent and has an active comment section with other young people sharing their stories. 

I haven't watched this video or gone through this site much [https://www.thehopeline.com/how-to-deal-with-verbally-abusive-parents-ep-24/](https://www.thehopeline.com/how-to-deal-with-verbally-abusive-parents-ep-24/) 

 but it looks like it could offer some support and advice for you, though again there is some religious language  

Try this site  [https://thenurturingcoach.co.uk/15-books-perfect-for-children-living-with-abusive-parents/](https://thenurturingcoach.co.uk/15-books-perfect-for-children-living-with-abusive-parents/)  It has some book reccomendations for older kids and teens that might be good to check out.

 [https://giveusthefloor.org/resources/#faq](https://giveusthefloor.org/resources/#faq)  This teen support site looks like it might be a good place to get in touch with peer support. It's for 13 to 19 year olds (I think 19 is the upper limit but you can check the rules again) and seems to work through Snapchat, so I'm not sure if it's something you can use. But if you can, it might be a good resource to at least get connected with others.

And just please, please understand that your dad's outbursts and arguments are not your fault, and since you are not the cause of what he's doing, you can't be the solution that brings peace to his behavior either. You are worth so much though, and deserve to have peace, and people in your life who love, value, and protect you. Those are not always our parents. However, maybe you could have a private talk with your mother about how the fighting is affecting you. She might not have the instinct to step in to protect you on her own, but if you give her the chance by telling her how much it's affecting you, then she might step up and do the right thing -- which is keeping you safe, getting your father help, getting you help for how this has impacted you, and getting the whole family help to be better functioning, happier, healthier & more peaceful unit. When you tell your mother, include information like that it's affecting your mental health, and behaviors like cutting. I know that's scary, but if possible just give her the opportunity to do right by you). Maybe talk to a kids helpline first, and ask how to talk to your mother.  [https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/](https://www.childhelp.org/hotline/)  Tell your mother that they told you that she has to get you mental health care, or it could be a child protective services  issue because your depression is severe. And while that might be an empty threat, it is also technically the law and her duty to you. Once you are able to get a therapist, then maybe have the therapist talk to your parents, and encourage your mom and dad to get involved in therapy for their own issues too. 

Hope something in the above helps!",t3_hej5s6
fx60hm0,t3_hej5s6,"The previous poster had a lot of good resources so I won't add to that. If you want an adult's perspective on what might be going on, here it is but I don't think you will like it. I may have misunderstood what you wrote, but you mentioned wanting to tell your father to stop talking. I have to say that I find that incredibly disrespectful. Please look at your own words and actions to see first how you may be antagonizing him. Most adults are tired, frustrated, hungry and grumpy when they get home from work. Interacting with a sassy teen who wants to tell them to shut up is going to make him flip his lid. Maybe I misinterpreted your post, but consider giving him space. Also, journaling is a wonderful way to explore your feelings without making other people responsible for fixing things. Find a creative outlet you can get into and pursue that. Don't make daddy the person responsible for your happiness. When you get the urge to cut, run to your room and pour it into the journal. I promise, it helps. Good luck on your journey and if your father is abusive, i.e. hitting, punching or worse, then definitely reach out to the authorities and your mom. Also, ask mom how to keep the pea e with your dad. She probably has a lot of ideas.",t3_hej5s6

fo9fvlu,t3_fy1zoo,"Hi. I'm also a 15 year old girl and i know I've felt like that in the past and still sometimes even now. Long story short, things went sour when I was in 7th grade and my dad got real angry. He was physically abusive to my brother, I think. For a time. Never laid a hand on me but I can hit back harder than my brother can. Anyway, I felt like that between 7th-10th grade. Thing have gotten a little better, but it's still...yeah. My sister was the most affected. At least, she shows it the most. She was suicidal from like 10-12, i think. She's getting help now.

I always thought it was bullshit that I was afraid to come home, but honestly I didn't tell anyone, at least until recently because I met people with similar situations.

I'm sure the quarantine is scary for you. It certainly is for me. I bet you just reallllly want to go back to school because sure, school sucks but at least it's not home.

Tell your teacher, I'd say. Its good that you have that kind of a relationship with him. 

And I know talking to people who've been in similar situations helped me. PM me if you want to talk about anything.

I just left anyways and if they tried to get me in trouble I'd have my mom talk to them. I also had extra time on tests and quizzes and I was aloud to take them in separate rooms. I'd often get talked down to like a child or like I was stupid because I had the 504. It pissed me off, a lot. But I made it through and proved a lot of people wrong, I got excepted into a good college and had a fairly large scholarship. But I wound up having to leave because of my mental health. It's an actual thing and it was mostly the anxiety that got me. But I hope it works out for you. There's lots you can get help with and what not. My anxiety can be crippling and cause seizures, makes me sick often. Luckily the first and only seizure I had was in early June of my senior year which meant I graduated in less than a month so I didn't have to worry about it affecting me at high school. I had a lot of stuff happen that cause that seizure and much more happen after. I've been through a lot and went to college for a bit but it was too much for me. I'm slowly ""recovering"" baby steps.

When parents don't protect us (I'm an abuse survivor too, adult now) we sometimes have to be brave and start figuring it out, and advocating for ourselves. Take pictures and video of the stuff you're talking about, if you can. Next time your mom hits you, call the police. Take pictures of bruises. Make a diary online including dates and times of specific things when they happen. Leave a webcam on if you think you can catch your mom doing abusive stuff. If you have any contact with school teachers, let them know what's going on. If there's someone who's kind and you trust them, send them pictures of the house, and ask them for support and advice about getting out. 

And also remember, if one thing doesn't work, that's not the end of your journey, that just wasn't your path to getting out. But your path to getting out is out there -- don't give up til you find it. Best of luck, I'm rooting for you.",t3_i9r124

fz76op3,t3_hxjxhc,"So sorry that happened to you. Yeah somehow it will stay with you whstever u do. A piece of your personality, a gift from adults who happened being around you. My brother and I have kind of similar experiences. So far I am trying my best, I didn't know back than because we were child , innocent and not lucky apparently for sure. I will not let them ruin my future. Yes i have anger problems too, bunch of mental issues etc. but as an adult , don't have any excuses like my parent. I am trying my best everyday, again and again. What I learned from my therapist is importance of practicing. Even i fail sometimes because of my childhood, i know i will try my best very next minute. I will never let them to haunt my future too. When it happened, i was child who couldn't do anything, but not anymore. Btw when i look my parents, feelings pity, i know they did not know any better unfortunately, and their parent weren't good them either. That's why i have my reasons to be my best version, to block this tradition! I have also my brother who is not doing good. I have to be his rock. Please if you can't find how to move forward , this time you will be the one who torture yourself with your abusers. You can not delete any of emotions and memories which are not pleasant but you need to practice to ignore them. I wish I could hug you and tell you all's done. We have to power to make things good, to change.  Look at yourself, you did alot, right, and you are successful. You will feel better too by time. I would like to share something that found it by chance and it really work for me, hope you will give it a try. It is a meditation thing, saying whatever but for me a miracle words solved lots of things on me. It goes "" do not try to stop thoughts. It will never work because it's unnatural. Try to disown them instead , do not follow them and watch them like passing clouds. Create a distance between you and your thoughts. It's very much like letting the birds fly over your property but not letting them build a nest. It takes a fair bit of practice. Once you master this art, you can see yourself entering this void so naturally and staying there as absolute peace"" . Lots of love and hugs.

fy38yb3,t3_hqvwch,"First of all, I (34f) just want to say thank you for sharing your story, and I am SO sorry all of this has happened. 

That said, I also have no idea what to tell you. My own parents have greatly injured me too. In different ways than the way your parents treated you. But I've been dealing with my hurts my whole life too. My relationship with my mom is pretty great now, although in many ways it always has been. She has always loved me a lot and been kind and generous, giving and devoted to me. Self-sacrificing even. But the thing is that she let my father (her husband) be verbally, emotionally, and mentally cruel to me, as well as slamming me and my brother around physically and stuff. He was cruel to her too. I spent a lot of time angry at her as a child since she wouldn't leave him, and she acted like she was totally at his mercy, that she had to keep the marriage together, and just go along with how my father treated all of us, and just ""pray for him"" and ""hope he changed."" I resented that so much, and viewed her as weak, unaware of her adult power, unwilling to stand up for herself or her kids. And I was just so, so, so so sooo angry at her for that. I eventually forgave her though, and just allowed myself to be aware of how her failure to protect me has affected me, but while I am aware of that, I also have compassion and sympathy to where she's coming from. I.e. a childhood of extreme neglect, then being brainwashed by a church, then being isolated and verbally and emotionally torn apart by an abusive husband, until she had no social network, self-esteem, or belief that she could leave and make money, or get custody and care for us. So although my mom really hurt me, I was able to forgive  her. 

My dad has been an asshole the whole time. He will never be able to be nice to me, proud of me, or anything. He feels sorry for himself because I am still injured and have mental health problems from him abusing me all my childhood. I had to file for disability after college because my mental illnesses were so bad, for so long, and ""getting help"" wasn't working, so I finally had to admit that I had a disability and couldn't work. It just made him ashamed and feel sorry for himself. He's hated me all the more ever since then. But for some reason he's still attached to me, and insists on keeping contact. I've tried to cut him out of my life several times, but it's hard because my mom is still married to him, and since I'm still disabled and living on welfare, sometimes I need to go to other people for money -- even if it's an abuser. It's also hard because when I try to cut off contact he acts hurt, acts like it would be sad for him to lose me, and he fakes being nice for a minute. It's hard for me to feel like I'm hurting him, because I do feel sorry for him. I know his life has been hard too. He didn't have a family in order to be abusive, and drive them all into mental health problems, and everybody blaming him and not wanting to be around him. I know he feels lonely and hated, and he probably knows in some ways that he messed up. He has never apologized in a way I've found sincere and about how *he* hurt *me*, instead of it being about the way he feels sorry for himself  for me holding his abusive behavior against him. He's just very selfish and immature, on top of incredibly hostile to me. *But it's just so so hard for an (even adult) kid to give up on their parent*. So I forgive him way too often, and end up spending time with him and talking to him way too much -- because he still cannot do anything but hurt and insult me. 

Oh well though. 

I talked to him about Covid, how he's older now (in his 70s), how I have an underlying condition, and how either of us could just lose our lives at any point during this (which is also true about life in general). I tried to plead with him to just try to put things right between us, stop the hurtful exchanges, let's just repair things and resolve our issues. I told him neither one of us is going to live forever, and it would just be a ridiculous and senseless tragedy -- *on top of* the ridiculous and senseless tragedy of my childhood -- if he just wanted to continue the hostility and mistreatment of me, and then I retaliate against him with my own hurtful words, then we both have hurt feelings and resentment toward one another. And it's just like -- why? Why not just interact decently?

But he can't. 

And I guess that's my ultimate point, is just that some parents can't do any better than they're doing. Some *people* can't do any better than they're doing. I always try to remind myself that the way people appear to be ""failing"" is actually oftentimes the best they can do, and all they are capable of. Sometimes you just have to accept that, and realize that other people can be hurtful, disappointing, and inadequate to you AND doing their best and trying their hardest, all at the same time. 

And then you have to ask yourself, if this is the best the relationship can get, do I continue the relationship. 

If my mom wasn't married to my father, I wouldn't continue a relationship with him.

fvj03qu,t3_hd4vho,">I‚Äôm a 19F now. I am safe now this all past events that haunt me. I just need to vent somewhere. I went through some hard fucked up shit as a kid. Sometimes I try to just forget or move on and forgive my dad and stepmom but honestly it‚Äôs hard. It all started when my dad married Louise. She seemed kinda nice at first to 5 year old me. Eventually my dad started leaving my alone with her when he would go out and that is when it all started. She would hit me and tell me that she hated my guts. She made me feel worthless at the age of 5. One time she made me stay in my room for doing some stupid kid stuff.

&nbsp;

>Then she came in and since I couldn‚Äôt play with any toys or watch any tv so, I was sitting there playing with my tummy. I was kind of embarrassed when she walked in considering how she would always say mean things and belittle me. She must‚Äôve not seen exactly what I was doing and was asking what I was doing. Embarrassed I didn‚Äôt tell her. Then she asked me if I was playing with myself. I was around 6 at that time I didn‚Äôt understand what that meant because to a 6 year old I was playing with myself. I was playing with my tummy so I told her yes. Then without any warning you she grabbed me by my hair and dragged me to the bathroom and started beating the sh** out of me in freezing cold water.

&nbsp;

>I remember hitting my head on the faucet. I remember my dads brother, (who also went through so much bullshit with that woman) he was 13 at the time, freak out and yell at her and tell her to stop. It‚Äôs sick. She wasn‚Äôt even married to my dad. They barely had been dating and she put her hands on me. She used to hold my head under water to ‚Äúwash my face‚Äù. It got worse when we moved and my dad started working long hours. I was stuck with just her most of the day. At the age of 7 I thought I wouldn‚Äôt live past 13.

&nbsp;

>It‚Äôs hurts having these memories of my childhood. I did have some behavior issues but it was never at home it was always when I went to school. Now that I‚Äôm older and I‚Äôm majoring in psychology. I have taken some courses and I think that‚Äôs how I used to deal with the physical and emotional abuse at home. At school I could act out and I wouldn‚Äôt be hit. At home if I did one little thing wrong I would be beaten and forced to stay in my room for weeks. We had stairs and I can‚Äôt think of all the times she dragged me down them. Every morning to wake me up she would literally grab my hair and drag me out of bed by my hair.

&nbsp;

>What the actual h*ll. I can‚Äôt understand how she thought any of this was okay. My dad is still married to her. I moved out at 18. Obviously I can‚Äôt talk about everything she did to me here but there‚Äôs so much more. Just 13 years of physical and emotional abuse from that woman. My dad wasn‚Äôt perfect either and used to beat me but, at least I was his child. I don‚Äôt know I know I‚Äôm all fucked up now. And it‚Äôs hard. I could‚Äôve came out a lot worse though. The only bad thing I really do I smoke weed. I‚Äôm a nanny now and I want to become a children‚Äôs therapist. I have a need to help any child that had to go through any abuse.

&nbsp;

>I just want to make a difference in their lives and do something. Every time I hear about a child being abused it breaks my heart. If any child is reading this and is being physically abused please don‚Äôt be afraid to reach out for help. What your parent(s) is doing is illegal. If you can try to have evidence if there are no marks on you before you call the police or child protective services. If you are being emotionally abused your pain is just as valid and you will be loved. I know it‚Äôs hard but you have to hang in there and get out of there as soon as you can.

fz2iodw,t3_hwt3zq,"Hi! While second hand smoke is certainly more harmful than inhaling it yourself directly from the cigarette it is far from child abuse.

If the parents were purposely blowing smoke into the children‚Äôs mouths and getting ashes on them then perhaps yes. 

It seems they have a dirty habit but know that doesn‚Äôt make them dirty or bad parents. If it bothers you I suggest introducing them to vaporizers otherwise there is not legal reason that this would be considered abuse at all.

fzqlpdo,t3_hp1bye,"I have not got the time yet but I hope I can have an answer more adapted to your particular case. I am not an expert but only share some key tips I learnt. I paste a comment I left for someone who wanted to help the abused here and you may have a look first. Ignore the irrelevant details. Questions welcome but no model answer guaranteed.

Our society is brainwashed, sorry to say that but I find it true to a large extent, that parents, especially mothers are considered sacred creatures, like superior to human beings. We need to wake ourselves up first. ""Parents are great and do everything for their children's good"" is a total senseless generalisation/idealisation/even a propaganda. We are always told that parents only do us good when we all only know one bio father and mother. We are naturally not allowed to compare different parents and distinguish good and bad. We all think our parents are just normal parents, like others'. The fact is, parents were children. They were just as normal as us all. They were JUST human beings, even when they become parents. The biological process of a woman's giving births DOES NOT transform anyone into a sacred creature. If you were a shit child, you become a shit parent. There is NO magic but logic. JUST like a group of people that contain a few smart ones, mostly average and some stupid. Parents are same. Only a few are good. The majority are just average to poor. Only we try to find our ways to live with this obvious yet not acknowledged fact. Check some stats if you want, but our parent love propaganda, again, hinders our progress in raising awareness, recording and supporting investigation. The numbers are limited and represent only the iceberg. Have you ever thought why parents are not trained to be good parents? Teachers need to get certified before they teach. Why not parents? Any particular valid reason? Just because their children ""belong"" to them that they are legitimately not required to be trained? But the children dont belong to them and they have the responsibilities to be good to them. Parents today open chat groups, forums, look for info from libraries, internet. Why? Because they don't know how to raise children. So, why no school, no course? Apparently, we are not aware that we should be trained to be good. Still, they are praised even they are shit? This propaganda is catastrophic to the abused because they are denied/isolated/made invisible by the society. Then, we celebrate mother's day and father's day. Well, studies show more than a half of parents are not qualified. This is actually the most normal result, as I said, most of us are just average, just like a class of pupils at schools. This is actually so obvious. But we are ""blind"". Plus, severe abuses actually shortens one's life expectancy of 20 years in average. Most deadly criminals were also found abused during childhood. Every 10 seconds a case of abuse is reported. (How many more not reported?) Abusive parents literally contribute to eliminate the human species. Sarcastically, we were crammed only the false idealised story. 

Firstly, understanding. If you want to help the abused. Sincere understanding is a big step. Let them know (before they can ""train"" themselves to actually feel it) that they have your acceptance, they may probably have trust issues, self-loathing, low self-esteem, rage/anger, emotional distress, sleeping and eating problems, PTSD, physical health issues, etc, their brain structure (if the traumas were frequent or serious) is actually changed for the abused survive the trauma. The secondary effect is that they lose trust in people. There are only 2 ways to heal. 1. Professionals: counsellors, therapists, clinicsl psychologists, etc. 2. They find someone who loves them unconditionally. To be technical, after understanding, help them learn to ignore/understand people's ignorance. Then, help them learn to know the abuse was not their fault ( their subconscious is implanted that it was their fault even their conscious does not). Next, help them release the emotions (listen to them, like pampering them) and help them heal their inner child (requires pro). If needed, do behavioural training. The key is, make subconscious conscious, unlearn what is learnt (let them understand they deserve to be loved for who they are, not what they do). Sports/yoga/meditation, to some degree, helps easing anger (anger is accumulated and suppressed for long, it can be explosive). This can be a long process and can take a lifetime.",t3_hp1bye

fwk7tnd,t3_hj1ptg,"Why do you think her parents are doing this?

Laws and guidelines on when to call vary from state to state, and in some cases county to county. Emotional abuse (sometimes called emotional neglect) is not something that CPS workers seem comfortable taking action on, even when there are laws which refer to emotional abuse. Hair pulling and hitting are more likely things that you could call CPS about, which they might screen-in to check up on. Such claims are easily dismissed and explained away by parents however. Hair pulling doesn't leave bruises. Other hitting might leave bruises, but the United States (if that's where you are) has an unhealthy respect for corporal punishment, and often there is vague language like ""reasonable discipline"", which  might mean that in the eyes of CPS workers and family court, there is not actually a problem, even if they do admit to hitting. And then there's the problem of if CPS does take action, and would that be traumatic. 

I just took melatonin before seeing your post, so I'm just responding as a cursory gesture. If I was more awake, I would try to find you resources online. But you can also do that. Google child advocacy, child welfare, family courts, and family law in your area (country, state, and possibly county). 

Secondly, try to think about what could possibly be going on with the parents, if they need substance use help, mental health care, if there is a financial stressor or multiple of them, or any other thing which could be of issue. Offer them some type of help and support. If CPS gets involved, that is often what they would do anyway (to my knowledge -- however, ask a family lawyer or child advocacy center in your jurisdiction for more specific, relevant, or accurate information). 

Also maybe you can advocate for the child to receive mental health care. If her parents are not relating to her in a healthy way with a mind to her emotional welfare and needs, then her behavior (although a normal reaction to distress/abuse) probably appears to  them as a problem. Some parents will see that as their kid just ""being a brat"" or ""defiant"", ""disrespectful"", etc.--ie. like a personality issue or moral failing--while others would see it as a medical /psychiatric/ developmental disorder/ pathological issue. I truly believe that it really, really sucks to put the stigma of receiving mental health services, and the burden of 'getting better' on abuse victims, instead of on the perpetrators who actually have the problem--but I also see it as a way to get some type of therapeutic care and oversight in a child's life. 

If you can, try to convince the parents to get some behavioral or mental health care for the child. And perhaps family therapy. I'll also add that you could research what's available in their area (or online) before bringing it up, and maybe try to get the phone call to occur while you are there, so you can make sure it happens. A lot of people drag their feet through things, say yes they'll do it, but then they don't actually do it. Try (in a friendly way) to ensure that it happens.

Getting therapy might be a real saving grace for the child and family. If its not, then getting the child (and ideally parents) into therapy has an additional benefit that mental health professionals are mandatory reporters. 

They *potentially* know what calls are actually received by CPS  in the area as credible and welcome calls, and what calls are seen by CPS as wastes of time, and ""not abuse.""  But they're also potentially *not* well informed about child welfare at all, even if they're a child therapist, so be on the lookout for that too.

This can especially be the case if they've had experience with CPS before. CPS workers are *not* trained to be able to tell the difference between abuse as defined by every other profession and society at large... and what CPS reports as a ""substantiated claim"" of abuse. CPS offices, workers, and family courts seem to constrain definitions of abuse and neglect to a very narrow definition, that seems actually narrower than wording in the laws and government literature.  And definitely narrower than what actually impacts a child abuse survivor's nervous system, mental health, and life outcomes. So even though that institution is our safety net for children, it's honestly designed to miss most abuses, and fail most victims. I believe that people should know this. It's often just up to the concerned people with preexisting relationships in a child's life to look out for them. That's why families in isolation are so so dangerous for children.

Do what you can to make it clear to your friend that being with her father may be more safe. Regardless of the distance, she will be safe and attended to. Once in a safe location it would be wise to call any social services. To avoid her returning to the abuser. No child should be neglected emotionally or frequently exposed to substance or alcohol abuse.",t3_gtphhr

He was too old for this to be considered playing doctor and hopefully must have had a crisis relating to this. If you think he‚Äôs still doing things like this, tell your family so you can prevent further abuse. Otherwise, I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm also a survivor so I can see the benefits of not raising an issue if the trauma is in the past as long as the intent isn‚Äôt to protect the abuser. I could see this being something you just discuss with your bf or in therapy if you choose not to involve family and potentially authorities. You can discuss abuse in therapy without reporting if the alleged doesn‚Äôt currently have access to children and the abuse is not ongoing. I disclosed my abuse but chose to not make a report because of the messy and traumatic nature of my abuse. Your interaction with him is not insignificant but relatively tame as far as sexual abuse goes. This was disgusting of him to use you for sexual relief in such a premeditated, deliberate manner... strikes me as deceptive. Your call. As for sex, yeah, I struggled to finish and I am a guy. I found that the person makes the difference. My gf and I found intimacy really increased our sex drive with time.  You could try to build intimacy with the three date rule and slow sex down to be more erotic and passionate. Some people just think the whole routine should be like porn which is a problem in it‚Äôs own right. Finally, there are a variety of reasons you likely feel distant from your family. Given your feelings of exclusion, isolation and detachment from your family, you could look into narcissistic abuse and complex PTSD descriptions on YouTube or read primary literature if you‚Äôre savvy with these things.

Can I ask how old you are, and if you have to live with him? If you have to live with him, can you hold off telling your psychiatrist the specific details, and maybe just say your symptoms are worse and you don't feel safe, feel at risk for self-harm or find yourself temporarily believing ideas that aren't right and are dangerous?

Religion is unfortunately a huge motive for abusive behavior in some people. When parents get convinced a youth in their care 'has demons' or 'is possessed', this can motivate physical abuse in the guise of exorcisms. Can you crosspost this to r/CPS or r/socialworkers?",t3_h89q1d

Another resource is a famous book called, ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel Van der Kolk, M.D.

I hope you give yourself grace and understanding in your journey toward healing. You deserve peace, and that is entirely possible! Also, reclaiming full memories is not required in order to heal.

Edit: sorry, accidentally hit the post button. Rest after this.

Thing have been... something. I sort of thought after I made this post no, im overstating it, it wasn't that bad, i just want to feel special or some shit.

My dad got violent with my brother. I don't think he's done that since i was in 7th or 8th grade. He grabbed my brother or shook him or something and my brother stabbed him with a pen. I'm still barely not killing my father. I think my mom's in serious denial. My brother was being an ass, sure, but it's not an excuse. When we were toddlers, my dad wouldn't even spank us because he was too scared to hurt us.

I was reading a book (fantasy) in which a girl had a moment where her father stopped just being her father (for fantasy reasons) and all of her moves became.. calculated. She knew how he'd respond to things, and she policed herself and very carefully manipulated him into not being mad at her, and it hit too close to home.

And my sister used the term child abuse today. To refer to what happened to us. Hearing from her made it so much... realer. Like it wasn't just absurd details I wrote down while habing some sort of breakdown. 

I just don't know how to feel and i feel shitty. I know he didn't mean to hurt us, he was just depressed and he couldn't take it. I still love him, i think, but i need to come to terms with it. He's been chill around me lately, but my brothers been acting up and it hasnt gone well. I'm still sensitive to yelling and i think my dad's starting to see it.

ds4hb82,t3_7nrguv,"I have some experience with this, but as the BF of the girl raped by her brother for 15 years. Rage. Pure unadulterated rage. I was specifically told not to say or do anything about it, but eating with this man (who now has a daughter) and her parents was a struggle. So many nights up with her while she cried about it. I cried about it. I loved her very much. Still do even though we're broken up. Violence wouldn't have solved anything, but it would have made me feel better, but then I wasn't the victim so not important if I feel better. She did attempt suicide a couple of times because of this.

If he has a history of it (you and your sister) I would say his daughter is at risk, especially if she's having severe emotional problems which is a sign. You can call CPS anonymously. They will investigate. They will interview the child and if anything is not on the level she will be removed. She can't protect herself, so it's up to you to do it. If they have nothing to hide then the CPS investigation will be quick and painless. Under investigation they will have him sign an order saying he won't be alone with his kids. That means nothing. Like it has no authority. He probably won't know that though so it might help. 

Personally, I'm sorry that happened to you. There's no words to convey that level of sorrow. Just know there is no statue of limitations on child abuse. If CPS can't stop it, go after him. It will be painful, but if you prevent it from happening again then it won't be in vain.

Sorry for the tone. Still very angry ex-bf. I felt powerless to help aside from the many many nights we stayed up crying. I don't like powerless, but I loved/love her and she said not to do anything. It probably wouldn't have mattered if I did.",t3_7nrguv

Do you mean 21 years ago when you were 5, or 11 years ago when you were 15?  It might matter because of the statute of limitations.

>I still can only remember a few seconds of the incident. I'm too afraid to let me myself remember anything else. 

Professional counseling can remove some of the trauma, if you're interested.  

>I'm actually doing pretty great - I'm just mad at my parents for not doing anything about my brother now with everything that is going on.

How much did they know?  

>He also has a history of abusing animals. I was reminded by my sister that when I was 10 years old, my mother and I found a large zip lock bag in his dresser filled with dead baby ducks. 

Your brother is a dangerous psychopath and needs to be locked up, either in a high-security mental hospital or a prison.  How did your mother handle that incident with the ducks?

>Of course they all fucking waited a year to tell me. I would have called the police. I'm still so confused as to why no one did anything.

They're not willing to make a scene.  They'll pretend like nothing is wrong, like it's a thing that they can handle inside the family.  Even though you have a young person torturing animals and stealing, they won't do anything about it.  your family is part of the problem.  It is their enabling of his abuse that has allowed it to go on this long.  Their inaction, in part, is placing his daughter in danger.

>The thing is - he also raped one of my sisters too. She is just a year older than me and I believe it happened around the same time.

Does your sister know that you were also raped?  If not, she's probably the first person you should tell, except for you boyfriend, who already knows.  The two of you are going to need to go to the police, since your niece is in danger.  I'll come back to that in a moment.

>My sister told me something happened and she said that she told my mom everything. Why didn't she do anything than either?

Your mother is part of the problem.  And I'm going to be blunt: this sort of thing is endemic in Mormon culture.  Check out /r/exmormon even if you haven't rejected your faith,  They should know how to work around the politics of the church better than I can.  

>My brother has a 7 year old daughter. She started going to therapy recently for severe emotional problems. 

There is a strong probability, a near certainty, that she is being abused.  Maybe not sexually assaulted, but definitely abused.  

>but when I last here she seemed fine to me but sometimes there's no way to really know if something terrible is happening.

Her behavioral problems?  That's not normal.  Combined with the fact that her father is a psychopath with a history of sexual assault and animal cruelty, you need more than just a CPS investigation.

>Any advice is appreciated

Like I said: your first step is to go to your sister.  Explain what happened, how you've been unable to remember it, and your suspicions about his daughter.  Tell her that your niece is probably being abused and you need to go tot he police.  Go together to the police station.  Report your sexual assaults, tell the officer on duty why you're afraid for your niece.  This way, you will have a failsafe.  If either or both of your cases against your brother fail, which happens tragically often, they can still investigate his daughter.  It might be enough to get her removed from that home.  

Also make a post on /r/exmormon.  Insular communities have corrupt police at a higher rate than other communities, and it's been a problem for survivors before.  There's a risk that they'll want to cover it up the same way as your mother.  If anyone knows how to get around that cultural barrier, that sub will be the one.

ds4ecch,t3_7nrguv,"I agree with everything /u/LawfulBroccoli wrote except about going to the police immediately, unless you have some reason to think the danger to her is suddenly increasing severely.  

Symptoms of a sociopath include torturing animals as a child, torturing animals as an adult (very bad), very poor impulsive control, irritability, angry outbursts, lying, not learning from mistakes, and recklessness - a pathologically high tolerance for risk to self and others.  

Sociopaths often have a history of parental abuse - neglect, severe and inconsistent punishment, sexual abuse.  
There is a genetic vulnerability involved with high functioning psychopaths.  This isn't my field but I get the impression the genetic vulnerability consists of several genes and the illness may manifest in various ways and severities depending on parenting.  You should look this up or get expert advice on it.  
 NPD (Narcissistic Personality Disorder and psychopathy can be comorbid and NPD has a strong genetic vulnerability too.  Again it develops after parental abuse usually.   

What I'm getting at here is that you all (including bro's daughter) have a decent risk of genetic vulnerability to personality disorders, and should carefully consider your parents' and grandparents' behaviour and upbringing.  Was there ever a Black Sheep or Golden Child in the families?  Is your brother a GC?  He doesn't sound a likely candidate, it is just one possibility your parents could be covering for him.    
Learn the symptoms of NPD and psychopathy and PTSD and ask your grandparents for advice on child rearing, about their childhood and how they raised their parents.  A story about a friend with a wild, wilful child might help get them talking.  

I know nothing about Mormonism but those tradcon religious upbringings can resemble some features of narcissistic abuse in some cases, gay or non-conforming kids can get it very rough.  

Your bro's daughter is at risk regardless of possible sexual abuse.  Parenting requires impulse control and empathy.  

Do not report anything to any authority until you have a clear plan for what you want to happen, and what evidence each authority needs in order to make that happen.  
Consider this: NPD parents are in my opinion about first equal with chronic sexual abuse in damage done to kids.  Yet their kids are practically never rescued.  If the kid is 15 and has  obvious signs of permanent and life-threatening psychological damage as the result of psychological abuse (BPD, say), and they go to police, the cops hand them straight back to their abusers and might not even notify CPS.  A child's word means little to them so long as the parents can play nice.   

If the kid goes to CPS and does not have evidence of physical abuse which can not be explained by any other means, and they don't report sexual abuse by a male, then CPS writes ""no further action"" on their report.  On our sub /r/RaisedByNarcissists you can see countless stories of such kids, practically none of them got rescued just by going to CPS without evidence they could use in court.    (Sexual abuse is different though).
.  
As soon as any mandatory reporter (basically any professional who routinely works with kids) is made aware of a risk to the daughter then pre-determined mechanisms take over, they are forced by law to do various things.  Ass covering of the pros and organisations involved is ALWAYS top priority for professionals, the interests of the child come further down the scale.  So your brother would be warned of their interest.  That might make it easier or harder for him to get treatment, and for his daughter to get treatment, and for her to get ongoing monitoring.  You might decide it is better for the girl to spend time in therapy, rather than risk having her withdrawn if your bro pulls up the drawbridge. 

This is asking a lot of you but is it possible for you to build a closer relationship to the daughter?  Have her to stay perhaps, if visiting is out of the question.

Consider who else could look after his daughter if it comes to that.  
CPS is hugely more receptive to the idea of moving a child to a nearby blood relative.  They know how dangerous their foster homes are especially for kids with behaviour problems, especially for girls.  

When planning your evidence, be ready for both your parents to not only agree you are lying about every specific incident, but also to provide joint evidence that you are generally untrustworthy and have a history of delusions and or lying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It is common for a rape accusation to split a family permanently, and also for the accuser to be left in a group which can number as low as one.  That is non-Mormon families.  I understand it is worse with religions like that.  

Talk to your sisters but don't reveal your hand too soon.  You need to know why they kept the tortured cat secret, why she didn't tell you she'd been raped, and whether she would go to the police.    
Recovered memories are rightly treated with great suspicion in court because their connection to historical fact can be very loose.  Your testimony could support your sister though.    

BTW Even though you are doing well, be careful not to let anyone unqualified dig around in your traumatic memories.   It is possible to stir them up and put yourself in a bad state, which can be persistent.   It is a job for a specialist in childhood trauma.",t3_7nrguv

If there's a possibility I can personally go after him for what he did to me I will without hesitation. I just don't know how much that would cost or if will even be successful.  I don't want to fail and have him completely lose his mind and kill someone.

Also some places have statutes of limitation (for minor victims) that don't start at the date of the rape but from when the victim turns 18. So even if it was 21 years ago there's always a chance it could be prosecuted. 

/u/unfortunatechildhood I'm not going to ask specifics (especially times and place). A good first step (free, anonymous, low effort) would be to contact a local rape/incest/pedophilia support network, they'll probably be very informed about statute of limitation issues.",t3_7nrguv

That's pretty much my brother - I will do some more research and see if there is a low cost way to speak to a professional. 

>Sociopaths often have a history of parental abuse - neglect, severe and inconsistent punishment, sexual abuse.
There is a genetic vulnerability involved with high functioning psychopaths... Again it develops after parental abuse usually.<

Does this mean that his illness developed because of my parents abusing him? All of my siblings are pretty far apart except for me and one of my sisters. I know that they were beat by my dad (he hit me a few times but I remember him mostly hitting my brother a lot) and my mom is kinda psycho and her family has a history of mental illness. This whole ""torturing cat"" incident has reopened a lot of childhood memories that I didn't really think were that serious but they all I guess lead up to my brother killing a cat last year. 

My sisters know that I'm going to eventually talk to my parents about why they cleaned up my brother killing the cat but they don't know that I'm seriously planning on making sure my brother is taken away somewhere. I don't want to fail that because that could leave to even more horrible things. 

>BTW Even though you are doing well, be careful not to let anyone unqualified dig around in your traumatic memories. .<

I am fine now but I know I definitely won't be if I remember everything. Something else could have happened and maybe it would be important to find out if it did if I take him to court. I might have a hard time convincing my other sister he hurt if I do. I don't think she handled that incident as well as I did and I believe her assault was more traumatic.  ",t3_7nrguv
dsarxzq,t1_dsafhbv,"CPS is pretty good at catching issues, especially molestation. If they don't find anything then there's a good chance it's not happening. That said, the report can be anonymous. I had a friend of an ex who's sons were describing graphic sex acts well beyond their age (8,6). CPS investigated and it turns out the father was watching porn and masturbating in front of them. He lost rights for sometime.

As with all things I would not recommend direct retribution. Are your parents aware? I was not allowed to end my ex gf brother, but I loved her (still do) to the point I would have. If I were to meet him in some random place there is now nothing to stop me. Again, not advocating violence, but the length of time she went molested without intervention infuriates me. She's sataisfied that it's over, but as a parent myself she is far kinder than I would be. As she was the victim I respected her wishes.

There is no stature of limitation on child abuse. If you went up against him directly, you would help to have your sister involved. Who are you afraid of him hurting?",t3_7nrguv

dtap3ux,t1_dsaflbx,"I've maintained a sibling relationship and for a long time, I put it to the back of my mind. My brother is like a loose cannon and most times he sees me, he's horrible (he's like 24?). He's bullied me my entire childhood which is pretty unfair if you think about it. I usually ignore him when he comes round only with the occasional comment, but I generally avoid him to avoid any remarks made about my life or me. 

My ex worked out what had happened to me and who did it, said that he hated my brother for it and then said ""Aren't you angry? Why aren't you angry? I'd be so angry!"" He was really angry and obviously full of emotion. I never really thought about it. I've been pretty passive about it, I guess because I don't want to cause a huge family drama. I told my ex that it would be a waste of emotion and you can't stay angry for the rest of your life. He couldn't understand it at all. But ever since, in the back of mind, every time I see my brother now, I think how twisted it is what he did to me and how we have to pretend like everything's fine. There's always been an odd tension, almost an invisible wall, something feels strange, when we're together. I like my brother for who he is, in terms of personality. Like he'd be a pretty cool friend to have and he is loyal to his friends, but he's not a very good brother. I don't know why he can't treat me as well as his friends or just take care of me, support me and look out for me like any other brother would. But then again, my dad doesn't look out for me either and he treats strangers with more respect and care than he treats my mother and I. 

Maybe you did it to keep the peace? Maybe some part of you has learned to let it go and stay in the past? Your BF can't know how to behave, how to feel or think unless they've been in the same position as you, so they can't really judge.  

I often wonder if my brother ever thinks about it. If he looks at me and sees the same thing. I remember a time he apologised to me for something unrelated, like after a fit of rage and he was evidently emotional and upset and then said he was sorry for 'everything'. It was like we both knew what we were both thinking and he looked me right in the eye and he seemed really genuine. I've never spoken to him about it, probably never will. It'd be heart breaking to have him not remember or pretend it never happened though - it would invalidate my violation almost. ",t3_7nrguv

In the USA it's a state by state issue, so I won't even try to give advice on anyone about their own situation. When the law changes there might be different ways it applies to offenses that happened before the new statutes of limitation came into effect. I'm from Europe, here it's easier because at least the rules are the same all over a given country.

That's why local victim's help groups (especially pedophilia/incest) are experts on those laws in their own jurisdiction (because they're usually the one who campaign to get these passed).",t3_7nrguv
dsafu7u,t1_dsaf7ag,"I guess it's about getting the ball rolling. If you have a good reason to get him investigated (your own story of abuse), it'll probably unearth a lot of things you don't even know about.

Those kind of people go about life victimizing others, but individually each victim has reasons not to speak out (for you it's family, for others it might feel like it's not worth it...). So when one person speaks up, others will follow.

From what you describe with his daughter sounds like a lot of red flags (which, without context, might be overlooked by authorities). Bet that even if you might not get him to jail based on your case alone (you never know), it might get child services to have a closer look at his family life. I'm not saying anything happened, but given what you describe about that guy, it would be a good thing for child services to be wary of him in any event. Not only about his own kids, but about all these he'll come in contact with because of his own child.

I have absolutely no legal knowledge (even less so in the USA) but victim groups might be up to date. I guess the laws of the state where the abuse occured would be the ones that matter.

You can also post on /r/legaladvice. They seem to have actual lawyers from all over the USA who might point you in the right direction.

Of course the best thing to do is to get your own lawyer (and then again, victim rights/support groups might have a list of the best people for these kind of cases, including those who might do a lot of pro bono work).

For what it's worth : 26 is relatively young for the few laws I know that extend statutes of limitation, but if you want to do something about it, please inquire ASAP about specifics because you might not have the biggest window remaining in that regard (I remember some laws being 18 + 10 years, but there's always a fight to extend those because of people who repress memories until their 30s/40s).",t3_7nrguv

2. Childhood abuse shapes us. It sounds very bad, but it shapes us not only in bad ways (anxiety, trouble with boundaries and so on), but also in good ways, i e heightened sensitivity allowing us to read others more easily. This leads to your experiences also shaping you sexually. It is perfectly normal. Everyone I ever met who has been abused sexually as a kid, including myself, have fantasies somehow relating to it as an adult. It is a way to process it. It is neither bad or good, it is neutral and it happens constantly. As long as you do not cause harm to others with these urges, it does not matters.

3. Anything you think and feel is yours. The only opinion that matters in regards to your sexuality, is your own. That is well within your power. People will try and force their opinions on you, but theyre still wrong. Ive been told I am NOT bisexual by family; yet here I am, almost 15 years later, and im still bi.

No, but don't give up yet.  Start by going on /r/socialwork and asking this question.  You can also ask on /r/Utah and /r/SaltLakeCity.  if there's anyone with direct experience or knowledge, those places are your best bets.  You can also call CPS directly to ask about that.  If that doesn't work, you'll have to do some leg work.  Go to the library and ask the librarian for help, because this won't be easy.  See if there are any old records of contemporary CPS audits or newspaper stories about them.  If they kept statistics over time about their records, those would be perfect, but you'll need to analyze the data yourself.  As a last-ditch effort, look for academic articles on the topic.  You'll have to check every publication in the social sciences, since social workers can get published in more than one place.  

If all of that fails, you're still not out of luck.  Call the Governmental Accountability Office and ask if they have any records of Utah CPS from around that time.  Either audits or general inspections might help your case, and beggars can't be choosers with regard to 30 year-old data.  If the State and local records were destroyed, there's a good chance that government records have been made electronic and archived since then.  It's also possible that they have it, but make it available only in microfilm or that it was never made electronic, in which case you'll need to go to the hard copy yourself and manually make the copies.

Tell them.  Therapists are supposed to be trained to deal with abuse issues, although admittedly not all of them are.  

As to help: where do you live?  Abuse is illegal in most places.  Your parents still hit you occasionally?  That's a crime, and they can be arrested for it.  There are women's shelters to give you a place to stay and welfare payments should be enough to live off while you're recovering.

Women's shelters never give your location away.  That's actually a big deal for them, because some of their resident's are at risk of murder.  And your parents won't know about your money.  Do they have access to your money now?  If so, you can just start another account up in secret and not tell your parents about it.  As to whether they would get the police involved: not unless you tell them you are being abused.  But you can go right to the police yourself, since they're committing crimes against you.  You said they hit you sometimes?  That's illegal.

It's normal for survivors of abuse to be affected into their adulthood.  There's nothing wrong with you.  But this might be the sort of thing that is worth seeing a professional over.   It can take a lot to recover from abuse.  It's a difficult and time-consuming process.  how does that sound?

If it wasn't my mother, it was either my sister or someone else whom my mother trusted sexually abusing me. It was horrible. 

Anyway, as I said before, your husband seems very caring. However, I was wondering if you're getting counseling for the abuse you've encountered? I know your husband may be helpful, but sometimes talking to an outside source can get the weight off your shoulders. I've been going to therapy for about 9 months now. I'm finally staring to undo my thinking patterns before I talked to someone (which I know is a gradual process). You may have a fear of suffering the same fate as you did as a child.

And found amongst others things that Jehovah's Witnesses encourage parents not to report child sexual abuse to the police. But to report it to the Elders but they will do nothing unless two people have see abuse happen. So since then I have been trying to help out in what either way I can.

It sounds like you‚Äôre not from USA, which I am, & I‚Äôve only dealt with CPS (Child Protective Service) here in the states. So I hope this story sort of gives you an idea.

When the cops and or CPS was called, it was because my mom had panic attacks. She didn‚Äôt know how to handle situations. So when I didn‚Äôt practice piano, she would beat me till I saw stars, blood, bruises. (‚ÄúWow, I bought this grand piano & you didn‚Äôt practice? What kind of daughter are you? You deserve to die. You need to learn punishment‚Äù etc etc). So when i told teachers, staff, counselors, they asked my mom about this. She would reply ‚ÄúOh she‚Äôs just an unruly teenager. You know how American teens are. She‚Äôs lying. I do my best as a single mother...why aren‚Äôt you on my side...?‚Äù That shit. Anyways, I come to find out, in America (this was 1998-2005), a child has NO say because technically, if you‚Äôre under 18, a parent & guardian always has the final say. I think the phone RAZR came out around 2004 & they had fairly nice cameras for that time period. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt have a good cell phone that could record at the time so I couldn‚Äôt get her on camera. YouTube wasn‚Äôt popular or Snap Chat wasn‚Äôt there so I only had words to defend myself.

I did have bruises and marks so I did get to live with a FANTASTIC foster family! Wow my life was so much better for those 6 months! I could sleep! I could eat! I could do homework and my grades skyrocketed!! Sadly, my mom was ashamed that ‚Äúshe lost her kid‚Äù so she lied to CPS saying she changed and that as knew she did wrong. I knew I lost the battle so I decided to put up with it (and now my mental health is suffering from this shit) till I moved out. I met a nice boy around 2006 whom is now my wonderful supporting husband! When he turned 18, my mom got a no-contact order so he couldn‚Äôt see me. My mom said since were dating, it‚Äôs most likely we‚Äôre having sex & that since I‚Äôm 17, it‚Äôs technically statutory rape. I thought the consent was 16, but it‚Äôs not. I am still a child since I‚Äôm under 18. The judge rolled his eyes and said had to do it...because it‚Äôs the law.

I‚Äôm hoping you did read this story because it feels like your mom is taking advantage of her power. I don‚Äôt know how old you are & I‚Äôm not even sure if you‚Äôre American, but my advice, from a survivor is, GET EVIDENCE. I hate how I fantasize about how different my childhood could have been if I got a video of my mom throwing knives at me, choking me, busting down every door in the house, beating the dogs till they yelp and collapse. Take advantage that you have a cell phone. She can take that away. You. Are. Her. Property.

I hope I didn‚Äôt offend you or anyone, but if I did, I want you to know I didn‚Äôt mean to do it on purpose. This is a difficult subject & I don‚Äôt think sugar coating anything that has to do with child abuse is right.

I can only assume the child was taken out of the home by the grandfather earlier in the day. My town has plenty of summer activities for parents who work long hours, year long. I'm under the impression that the parents don't want the child to mingle with the ""wrong"" people in case she talks about her lifestyle. A neighbor once overheard the kid say: ""I'm five years old!"" The father told the kid: ""Shh! You're three."" I know there are limits as to how old a child can be living in a one bedroom.

>and let's say he was abusive because he grew up in rural area of a third world country

No.  Culture is not relative.  Adults don't get to use their upbringing as an excuse to abuse others, especially their own family.  Most people who were abused go on not to abuse their own children.  And since they all know how that affected them, they have no excuse to treat others that way.  

>but you still hated him because you think it completely messed you up do you think you should forgive

No.  You are under no obligation to forgive your abusers.  Even if they genuinely reform themselves, their victims will still have the trauma from years of abuse.  No matter how genuine the abuser is in their reform, the victim will always have that fear at the back of their mind, ""what if he goes back?  Even just once?"", and that makes it impossible to have a healthy relationship.  The victim will always be afraid of their ex-abuser.  In that case, it's still better to end the relationship.

You know that movie ""A Christmas Story?"" If not, it's a christmas comedy that I don't really remember that well. (probs blocked it out because of this event) Well, theres a part where the kid says a bad word by accident and the parents punish him by making him keep a soap bar in his mouth.

If it would not be too triggering, I would highly recommend at least skimming the book ""The Body Keeps The Score.""  https://www.amazon.com/Body-Keeps-Score-Healing-Trauma/dp/0143127748  It really helped me to connect the dots about how key parts of ""my personality"" or ""bad luck"" being assaulted as an adult might actually be related to childhood sexual abuse.  If you are abused as a child, your brain and body's alarm system can literally wire differently in order to survive it and leave you vulnerable in other ways later in life.  There are a lot of techniques in there to help regain some of control when you are in a triggering experience, such as the ones you are experiencing.  

Talking to anyone (even strangers on the internet) is a courageous step, but getting a team of loved ones ""on the ground"" can also be important.  Even if years have passed, it can be difficult to hold it all in and to effectively process sexual trauma by yourself.  Have you ever talked with anyone about how you are feeling... close friends, family, or any previous significant other?  Not to say that counseling is right for everyone, but have you considered counseling, particularly at a practice that specializes in rape / assault?  

Also, any SO or friend that is worth your time will face the news with grace and understanding.  It's not exactly a great topic for a first date, but it also is a part of you that might be empowering to share.  I had intimacy issues when I was younger and sharing my past helped both me and my partner overcome those issues together.  My close friends also know about it and have been incredibly supportive.  

Finally, if you are around adult men that are talking about teenagers a lot, maybe try to separate yourself from that situation as much as possible?  Can you leave the room?  Can you pull them aside later or even in the moment, and let them know that they are making you uncomfortable?  Not blaming you at all for their behavior... but in general the >90% of people that are non-intervening bystanders enable the <10% of people that create a toxic culture.

This is probably a good thing.  The police know enough to be persistent on this case.  They suspect something is wrong, even if they can't prove it yet.  

>The first time the police came over the child was gone from the home. The child was snuck out of the home while the father stonewalled.

Your second comment: Someone claimed they saw the child with grandfather getting off a train. 
So recently someone saw the child with an adult. Some of the neighbors have recently seen the grandfather around a lot. Others have not. Where the family lives in the neighborhood is in a spot where not everyone sees the family all the time. Some neighbors are approached by the father more than others, so they're more apt to talk.
It is a good thing that the police are around the family more often. The neighbors who were approached by the father are now talking to each other. I went to DCFS not too long ago. Another neighbor went to police not too long ago. We're starting to talk and share stories. We're also becoming more vigilent at what we see. One neighbor is recording what she sees and reporting it.

When you say someone is almost certainly abusive, it really shouldn't matter which one thing in particular it is.  

I don't have much experience with child abuse, so this is more difficult than when I'm talking to adult survivors.  The hiding her underwear thing is weird.  It might be no big deal, it might be something more insidious.  But it's certainly worth having something talk to her about.  The deliberate overfeeding should be considered child abuse, but probably isn't.  Issues with food/ your friends giving their son food might be no big deal, but they might be something else.  The staring off into space might be no big deal, or it might be something serious.  And the odd clothing, and the bullying, and the lack of friends, and being disliked at school, and waking up crying, and refusing to sleep alone, and separation anxiety at her age, and refusal to do her homework, and her mother enabling these behaviors, and whatever else you haven't told me about.

Taken individually, any one of those conditions might not be a big deal.  Taken together, they represent quite an alarming condition.  You say there is a near certainty that she is being abuse- that alone should be enough to justify a call to CPS, even if your friends would be angry.  And frankly, the fact that they wouldn't be willing to call CPS themselves makes me worry that they aren't really fit to be parents, either.  ",t3_5dintn

I think the reason my friends haven't yet contacted CPS is that there is nothing concrete, just this wealth of curious circumstantial evidence. My understanding is that Tina's mother makes co-parenting difficult already (or Mike does, or they both do, rather than blame let's just say it is tense), and as there is no clearly telling behavior or testimony from Tina detailing any unlawful conduct by an adult, there is nothing concrete Sarah and Mike can point to and say ""this is abuse,"" and realistically, any accusations they make will need support and will probably permanently ruin any civility between the formerly married couple. Certainly I agree this consequence is immaterial if Tina is being abused. I just wish there was something concrete to point to. To my mind, ""excessively feeding your child while you starve yourself bc you are unhappy and self-conscious re your own body,"" I mean, to me that sounds incredibly abusive and damaging, but IDK whether CPS would agree.

dpop458,t3_7c94do,"> I always hear about ""the system is failing"" can some one elaborate on that.

Yeah.  

There are a few main problems that I can think of, just off the top of my head: child services, foster care, and prevention.

Child services is infamous for being disliked by everyone.  The command, control and quality varies from one district to another, so it's hard to give a generalization.  But the consensus that they are both failing to remove at-risk children while also removing children unnecessarily.  Keep in mind that social workers at CPS are legitimately overworked and underpaid in many/most cases.  So what you get is a group of people who have too little time to investigate every case, at least the way they're supposed to be.  This will lead to pressure on case workers to rush cases through, and try to prioritize by dealing only with those they think are the highest risk.  You'll also see a lot of pressure on supervisors to report improvements on statistical data.  So supervisors pressure case workers to record cases as ""not enough evidence to pursue"" or ""unfounded"".  I can't prove it's going on, but I'd be willing to bet that it's commonplace in districts throughout the US.  The fundamental problem is that this shit costs money, and the taxpaying public isn't willing to pay more in taxes so that children can live free of abuse.  Conservative Republican types in the US will also argue that government *can't* fix any problem whatsoever, and any taxes will just be wasted somehow.  

So you see children making multiple phone calls and still not being removed.  And part of this is that case workers just aren't well-trained in a lot of cases.  I had a survivor here not too long ago say a case worker came in and said ""abused children don't generally have a TV in their room"", or words to that general effect.  Obviously, the presence of a TV doesn't stop them from being beaten or emotionally abused, and most abusers are savvy enough to abuse in ways that aren't illegal, or at least won't leave marks.  

That pretty well covers children not being removed.  But some are removed, or at least investigated, when they don't need to be.  In most places, CPS is required by law to investigate every claim, even when they're bullshit.  And that's good- they *should* investigate every claim, they just need to have the resources to do so.  When they get call from angry exes and busybody neighbors, they have to investigate those.  It's hard to know what proportion of cases are in this category, and I'm sure it varies by location.  But what I'm talking about are more serious cases, where children are removed because it's required by law that they be removed after a claim is filed, and the process can take months or years while going through the maddeningly-slow court system.

And the law is what's at the heart of much of this trouble.  Generally, things are done the way that they are because of the law.  And laws are written by politicians, generally with minimal input from experts, as is normally the case in the US.  Politicians, responding to a complaint, looking to save money, to please a lobbying group, or to score points by being ""pro children"" can pass laws that have little real impact, but add to the administrative burden of child services.  Over the years, this accumulates until it becomes unwieldy.  Politicians wanting to please their constituents, will pressure CPS to deliver improvements in their reported services.  The directors of child services, in turn, place pressure on their subordinates to deliver statistical ""improvements"", as I've already mentioned.  

I'll move on now to the foster care system.  I don't know what the fuck is going on, but there is an epidemic of child abuse in the foster care system.  Seriously, I don't know what causes this, and you would need someone more well-informed than I am to figure it out.  Some (many?) foster parents are in it for the money they receive, and abuse or neglect their foster children.  There is often a shortage of foster homes, which leads to shortages and lowered standards.  Case workers would prefer to keep children near their current location, but I understand that's not always viable.  Even more than that, they prefer to keep a child with their family.  In some, but not all states, case workers will jump through hoops to keep a child with a distant relative.  These relatives are often a product of the same damaging culture that led to the child being abused, and will treat the child much the same.  Others will allow the abusive parents contact with a child even when it is not allowed.  Children being a product of that environment, will often lie to case workers out of fear of being removed, often at the behest of their abusers.  There is sometimes money and support available for kinship care, but relatives often don't know about it.  There was actually a segment on VOX's Youtube channel about this and the opioid crisis not too long ago.  

Once removed, there is no telling how long the process will take.  The court system is maddeningly slow.  And to get back to the law, there are often requirements that give bad parents second chances that they do not deserve, removing children from foster homes where they have begun to feel a sense of stability and develop bonds with their foster parents, to send them back to their biological parents, who will inevitably fuck up again.  And you'll probably hear from a lot of legitimately bad parents about how ""the government stole their kids"", and not all of those claims will be legitimate. 

It's not just case workers you need to watch out for, it's the police.  They're often not really trained for this.  They also have domestic violence rates 2-4 times the national average, and they take those values with them when they respond to abuse cases.  There's a lot of bad cops, and it's not just a few bad apples- this is a systemic problem, especially in some districts.  Be especially wary with teenage victims.  these are the ones most likely to report their abuse, and officers tend to have an authoritarian view of discipline.  If you have a teen abuse victim, there's a good chance that the officers will insist that what they're undergoing isn't really abuse, that the teen is exaggerating for whatever reason.  This includes physical abuse, too.  It's just something to watch out for.  

When children get to you, many of them will have behavioral problems.  Many of those can't be corrected, and those that can might require years of professional aid.  Many will have untreated disorders and no resources to address them.  That's what you're really looking at: an unpaid babysitting job where nothing you do makes any difference most of the time.

A final word, on prevention.  Much of this could be avoided if children were all taught bodily autonomy, that they could report abuse to an adult and it would be taken care of.  Sadly, even if it were taught, that isn't the case.  Many survivors report their abuse to a relative and their relative doesn't believe them, or blames them for the abuse they have received, or insists that it isn't really abuse.  These children will seldom reach out again.  In the case of survivors reporting their abuse to a teacher or school counselor, I've rarely seen a school counselor actually report abuse in accordance with the mandatory reporter laws, to such an extent that I've stopped sending survivors to their school counselor.  Most teachers, upon learning of abuse, will pass the buck and tell the student to see a counselor, not even taking them in person or checking later to see that it was taken care of.  Those who do report it to CPS will often find that the case workers either don't even show up, or did and nothing came of it.  there will be no follow-up from these school counselors to ensure that the children are taken care of.  Cases of people that do their job correctly occur, but they are a pleasant exception to the general rule.  The rule, broadly stated, is that child abuse is not taken seriously.

We get home. He's not happy. He grabs a bright pink belt and tells me to drop em. I fight back and he hits me anywhere he can while getting my pants off. Then he beats my ads until I cannot stand and sends me to my room. ""You're grounded until I say so.""

Teachers are no help so I go for walks now to escape. I am defiant and want nothing to do with adults at all, they are all liars. I come across a large deposit of white quarts (the kind that is really common in northern California) and start breaking them open, I know I can find gold in them. The property owner comes out and says ""what are you doing"" I explain that I am looking through the quartz for precious metals and he says ""be careful son, some people may shoot you if you go on their property."" I take this as a threat and proceed to destroy his property when he leaves. The cops show up ofc and they ha e to pay for the damages. I explain my reasoning with the owner and he takes it, shakes my hand and I never hear another thing about it except for the beating I got within an inch of my life. I was out of school for a week and could barely move. 

I was never allowed to leave if the marks looked like beating marks they couldn't discount as kids being kids. The entire time we were in that house I was made to look like a liar to every adult we met. Anything I said was unwound and broken down to a troubled kid with no future and they got sympathy for it!!!!!

Halfway through 6th year we move again, this time to  a small town in Idaho. ",t3_77nmii

First issue: Are you still living with an abuser?  How old are you?  Where do you live now?   Your story cuts out with no resolution and no request for help.  

>my 11th birthday where I find out that my mother had changed my name and forged my birth certificate to hide me from my real dad.  

Is your bio-father dangerous?  Why did she do that?  

> she picked it because it had a great big basement and a giant garage all great places to put up a lab now if you've ever lived in certain inner-city areas you'll know what I'm talking about. 

A meth lab?  Spell it out.

What's bothering you?  ",t3_723fuo
dnfj3hc,t1_dnfgjbl,"Ok thank you for responding. 

There is much to this story because it starts 28 years ago. Basically I was abused by a family member when I was 4 years old. My immediate family members knew about it and the situation was dealt with in a way that I still have trouble trying to understand. I have pretty much accepted that my mother did what she thought was best at the time though. 

After the incident I remember I had no contact with this person for many many years. Nobody ever talked to me about it and it was almost like he never even existed. I think that my mother had hoped that I would not remember what happened. To an extent I did forget about it but I absolutely know now that a lot of the strange, inappropriate behaviors and rituals I engaged in as a child were the result of that incident. I don't know if these things just went unnoticed by my family or if they chose to ignore it. 

What is really bothering me now though is that for the past year or so I have had to live under the same roof with this man. He is very old, I don't think that my family ever thought he would live this long. I get along with him fine but I do try to avoid him as much as possible. I am having a hard time dealing with my feelings about him and about the whole thing really. 

I have spent so many years just never talking about it, holding it in like it's some secret I have to keep forever. The thing is that sometimes I  feel like it's had some kind of profound affect on who I am today and how my life turned out. Some days I really hate him and I truly wish he would just drop dead already. Other days I think that he doesn't know that what he did was even wrong and my life would be no different had the whole thing never happened.

I have not really ever had an opportunity to talk about this with anybody beyond just mentioning what happened to me. I guess I just wanted to talk about it with someone or at the very least just put it out there and say some of the things on my mind. ",t3_723fuo
dnfj7ee,t1_dnfj3hc,"> and the situation was dealt with in a way that I still have trouble trying to understand.

People seldom have the knowledge to deal with child abuse appropriately without professional training.  The real issue is whether your abuser is still welcomed as a member of the family. 

> Nobody ever talked to me about it and it was almost like he never even existed. 

That's not the way to handle it.  

> I don't know if these things just went unnoticed by my family or if they chose to ignore it.

The latter, in all likelihood.  Many families take the attitude that a problem will disappear if they pretend it doesn't exist.  

>What is really bothering me now though is that for the past year or so I have had to live under the same roof with this man. 

Might I ask why?  

> The thing is that sometimes I feel like it's had some kind of profound affect on who I am today and how my life turned out.

It did, I'm sure of it.  

>Other days I think that he doesn't know that what he did was even wrong and my life would be no different had the whole thing never happened.

Unless he's mentally handicapped, he knew what he was doing was wrong.

In the State of Arizona it has been admitted under deposition that this state DOES NOT obtain a warrant to seize children!  A direct VIOLATION. 

This admissions was made by:  
Greg McKay - Director of DCS
Gene Burns - Ex-DCS Program Manager
Caryn Wagner - Caseworker
Deborah Harper -  Assistant Deputy Director
Lyn Hart - Supervising Social Worker

They also admit they DEFIED court orders by the Juvenille Court Judge to return the children ""home"" with their parents/family; the case was thrown out.  DCS kept the kids refusing to return them!

DEAR VICTIMS of DCS/CPS/DHS et al.
We will set precedence to open the door to stop the human trafficking of children for federal funding.

Pellerin vs Wagner, et al.
Case No: 2:14-cv-02318-JWS

A complaint was filed on 04-JUN-2015 on behalf of Devin & Angie Pellerin by McMillan Law Group.  This complaint is at the Federal Level within the 9th District Court. 

The publicity this trial is going to generate will open the flood gates by exposing the true corruption behind the state sanctioned and illegal abduction of children for profit, via federal funding. I do not need to go into the horrific details of the abuse my grand-children suffered under the hands of CPS/DCS; we all, unfortunately, have horror stories that we live on a daily basis.  Horror stories that will haunt us for the rest of our lives.

The only way to be victorious is to ‚Äúhelp me to help you‚Äù.  Families battling the courts on their own is exactly what the Government / State wants.  It is way too easy to ignore your rights and get away with it.  The end result in most cases?  Severance & Adoption.

We have all learned the hard way that major news media does not report the REAL truth.   Attorneys, judges, elected officials and those making insentive bonuses are NOT here to protect your rights.  No they are here to take their slice of the blood money made from trafficking children.

We have been blessed with the legal representation of the Law Offices of Shawn McMillan of San Diego, CA & Joe Bertrand of Phoenix, AZ. The two offices have combined their career successes and most importantly their compassion to ensure ‚ÄúWe the People‚Äù keep our unalienable rights; ‚ÄúLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness‚Äù. This guarantees our precious resources, the children, are safe from harm.  To keep our children...

This is an expensive endeavor that will have a postitive effect on all victims.  It is a win-win! 

To continue in our fight for our GOD given ‚Äúunalienable rights‚Äù we need your help.  By winning this lawsuit it will open the flood gates and expose Crimes against Humanity (Children & Families) not only in Arizona but throughout the country.

Corrupt judges, CPS/DCS workers, attorney's, elected government officials are operating a state sanctioned kidnapping racket [RICO]. These predators operating under the color of law are kidnapping our children for money. They demoralize and destroy the developing mind of our children during their most tender years and our vulnerable parents during the twilight years turning the beginning and end of their lives into nightmares, leaving shattered and distraught families in their wake.

Because our elected and appointed servants refuse to protect and champion our most precious and hallowed resource, our children; they too are guilty of this travesty and aid in the distribution of blood money gained by the illegal abduction and selling of children.

My mother, says I shouldn't remember that.

Correct.  People generally can't remember things that happened before the age of about four.  Memory is malleable.  If you remember something before then, it's likely not a thing that actually happened.  You were told about it and your mind constructed a false memory of how you think it would have happened.  

>I had no clue.
at that time, ""little girls got molested, little boys, just got educated.""

Terrifyingly common.  

It's normal for childhood abuse to continue to affect people well into adulthood.  There's nothing wrong with you for that, and it doesn't reflect poorly on you.  Is this something that's still bothering you?  Treatment options are available.  If you just came here to vent, that's also acceptable. ",t3_5do9tl

you may be able to ""hear"" the part of the chorus where you should ""read"" it.

now, as to that memory?  wrong answer... my mother, never spoke of it.  we did not speak of it, until I was in my 30's.

smells, can bring up strong memories.  I have two memories of the house we lived in when I was 3.

They are crystal clear... and I can almost taste the sky.

I can smell the fish.

The walls were yellow.. and I have no memory of voices what-so-ever.  an impression that the reason he lost it , was because i refused to eat his damn fish.  i can smell it, and it makes me want to vomit.  I hate catfish to this day.

every time, i eat catfish, or smell it, it brings that memory back.  every time.

I can see the smoke, clouding the room, but I cannot see everything as ""some"" of it is probably reconstructed.

what you fail to understand, is that children, re-iterate those memories they wish to keep. (or not)  sure they distort... but when confirmed with my mother 26 years later?  I was RIGHT!!!!

there are no photos of this time either.

I remember this just... i was crying because the catfish has a disgusting taste and smell.  smoke... and no vision of a kick... but my impression of a kick?  and a clear picture of hitting the back wall and the legs kicking out.

Don't think one clarifies as the exception?

how about this one.  the other one.

That house, was the VERY first time I realized the world was a big place.

I can CLEARLY see my little brother, standing to my right.

I am just barely, tall enough to see over the soybeans in front of me... no, i didn't know that then... i know what soy beans look like now, and that is the same broad, pointy, and at that time, very large BUSH in front of me.  I can barely see over the top.

now, the impression... as I looked over this endless field and saw the sky ... not the sky, but the vastness of it...

I was looking over this endless field, and saw the missisippi river bridge on the horizon for the first time...

what am I doing? i, apparently, look to me, like I'm being the big brother, and showing my 11 month younger brother... the world.

When I told my mom, at 33?  she said that was the house we lived in when I was 3.  and, that I SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THAT.

I have an image of brightly colored flags...as I look up.

mom says, apt west Plaqumine.... I was 2... there are no photos.

apparently, she say, there was a used car place and this apt was in that lot.

I can SEE it, not like a reconstruction... picture perfect.

I remember a night mare I used to have... 

about a babbling giant, that would chase me, hound me, all the while babbling in a tongue I could not understand.

and throwing giant colored doughnuts at em, terrorizing me.

and then, flash forward as I play with my daughter....

She has a new toy, a white rocker, a yellow plastic spike, and colored doughnuts..

and I can SEE my dream... it was that fucking bastard dad of mine.

DO YOU have any idea how long that dream tormented me?  until I was 8.

Now, that I know what that nightmare means?  screw him.

When I was a baby, I was removed from my mother because she tried to smother me.

Found that out from my 12 aunts and uncles.

know where my mom met my dad?  Mental Health Clinic... yeah, that's messed up.

She told me this when I was questioning her about my memories, that I shouldn't have.

I DESTROYED her ability to use that excuse by bring up things from 3 onwards.  with ""picture perfect"" clarity.

I can even draw you the house plans of every house I can ever remember, except the one's from 3 and before.. except the one where the high chair incident happend.

I remmember clearly, my 4th birthday present, when dad got out of the crazy prison, before the rape event before the molestation event.

Dad had come over, mom let him for christmas,  he brought a little green and red wooden wagon for me, that he had built in the shop at correctional facility.

I drove my mom to the park where we met him once...and showed her where I thought the table was... she said, again, that I was correct.

that was at 3.5 yrs she says.

Come ON, surely, you've met people with picture perfect memory?  well, mine is not perfect... but I can give you the blow by blow of kindergarden, at 4.5... mybirthday, was 3 days after christmas...then, i was the smallest in my class as Jan was the grade change then.

so, want to know anything about that?  picture... perfect.

teacher?  want to know about the first time I passes on the improper touching ... with a fellow student?

picture perfect, i can describe the cubicles, and i can draw you the play ground and the floor plan of the K thru 1 building?

can i remember?  i went to 8 elementry schools, and 3 high schools...


seperation anxiety?  you bet.

picture and smell perfect memory.. no voices, just impression of voices, as if they were my memories whispering.

want any more?

let's be thankful, my mom married a guy that taught me about improper touching, or i might have been a freakin perve.

I can tell you much more about 3, but would you believe?

anyway, sorry, but most of that is not reconstruction,

they were reiterated ... if i'd alter'd them too much, I'd loose the visual or the smell.

But, i'm telling you... crystal clear... and I've got 12 aunts and uncles... and a mom who think I'm weird for being able to tell them stories from when I was a child.

at family reunions, I am the one that reminds everyone of the time cousin thomas blew himself up, the time I ran on top of the picnic table... and at 2 or 3, cracked my front teeth on the metal cloths line.

I remember the first time, granma, told me not to touch her pretty little tobasco peppers.  I was barely taller than the plant.

it looked like a christmas tree.

i remember crying and running to my momma, becuase my eyes hurt.

i remember a time, when my uncles were young... my uncle kenneth.. FREAKED out when I remined him, my Uncle Paul, and my uncle jerry, that they were drinking bud light, while working on a black and blue .. later, i found out Mercury, outboard motor.

They were YOUNG.

They told me more about it...  aparently, what made that so remarkable to me, was, that they had just finished cutting down the big oak behind maw maws.

the stump that was there for most of my life.

I remember not the tree, but the day i went to maw maws, and it was cut down.

My Uncle kenneth says I must have been 2 or 3.

They all think I'm weird for being able to remember stuff like that.

I can go anywhere I've been before, and the memories pop right back up.

I can't forget anything.

I am thankful, that I blacked out in the closet.

I , personally, think that trauma can mature a child in some way much too early.


and, Thank you.. the anger, if not let out, can turn inward... and you know what that means.

As a Veteran... hell, i had PTSD BEFORE I joined the Army.

Anyway, i recognize the need to vent to express.. so that I can relieve some pressure.

I do not wish another trip to the VA, because I've bottled up my anger and frustrations.

it's weird... how i'm not angry at any ONE... just.. angry sometime.

no direction, no one to blame... until it turns inward and I start a pity party.

so, thanks ... i'm glad you said that...  it reminded me... i suppose ""what"" i must be doing.

venting.

it's sort of horrible, not being able to forget like I see normal people do.

Anyway, if you ever need to write a paper on study case... i'm an open book.

nor, do I hide behind anonymity.

lll... heck, i even have ""recorded"" for the world, my breakdown a few years ago.

they older vets realized what was wrong with me... talked me down.. and sent me to the VA.


Yes, I wasn't homeless, but I rationalized it as a ""nomadic existence.""

fucked up, living like Rambo for a while.

but, now, i'm back, integrated in civilian life.. got a job, a girl friend that is VERY understanding.

anyway... i'm the joker... I laugh and throw feces at the lion.


I know now, that the coping skill for venting I used to have was inappropriate.

now, I attempt to express adn vent with the written word.

sorry if I offended, but I can't thank you enough for letting me get it all out.

belch.

whew.

man,  i feel like refreshed.

... I should, be ashamed of myself, for using you to get free counseling...but... i do feel better.

anyway, if you want to know more... I can tell you so much, it will leave your head aching from cognitive disorder headaches ;-)

I can even tell you a funny storey about how I educated my daughter on the dangers of improper touching.

i bored her with a storey, from 3 to 11... till she says ""I know dad"".

after that... i just asked her, once, each year on her birthday, ""Baby, do I need to kill anybody this year?""

She'd smile, and say ""no dad.""

It's easy to head off, if you can address it instead of hide it.

anyway... you da man.. your short words.. exactly what I needed.

I owe you.. If you need anything, just ask.

WHEW!!! man I feel so much better.

OOOO RA!

You have a great weekend.  I will now.

and again, thanks.. i didn't need anyone to really read it. lol.

just needed to get it out.

I do tend to ... get in character... then... sometimes, intentionally remove the formatting..

I sometimes think that's passive aggressive behavior... sort of like taking my anger out on the reader?  maybe?

once again.. that crap.

i consider myself a nice guy, but when i calm down and reread?  i'm an ass..

That anger inside, ... it unmans me and isolates me from others.

I suppose, I'm gonna need a bit a anger therapy here soon.

maybe, this new job is stressing me.  something must be up, as my word count is extremely high.

... yeah.. hehehe bad poety should always be skipped ;- bad music too.

No he is a Predator. Why didn't he sleep with his girlfriend? He was dating an adult woman and harassing her daughter. 



>Basically most people are good but some get blocked in finding the right methods for satisfying their needs which include play exploration and adventure. 

You can do this without violating others. He was dating a woman. 

>In dysfunctional societies, like ours, they often go completely crazy. We should not jump to using evil stigmatizing labels about people.

I'm not sure where you are from but not all societies have the same severity of issues. 



>In a sick society many people are forced to use devious sometimes unscrupulous methods to fulfill normal desires. 

No, he had the option to go to therapy. To break up with the mother and leave the daughter alone. 

>Your friend has been fooled into thinking she has been damaged or changed by hype spread by sex fascists, not by the actions of this person.

You are sick. You go around telling people they haven't been abused. You need help. Then you defend the abuser.


Sex fascists and others looking for ways to make themselves important try to pump themselves up by telling scare stories.

Delusions. Dismissing victims of sexual abuse. Sick. 


They want us all to think anyone with sexuality different from theirs is a ""predator, pervert, molester, etc.""

No those individuals are. 

There is nothing wrong with her or with this other person that just saying ""no"" could not have solved.

She was scared and a child. The adult had no right to make her have to say no. You are victim blaming. 


>In a healthy open society people can talk about these things and change their conduct in safe ways. 

You idea of healthy is adults having sex with kids. ",t3_5aigj8
d9rogav,t1_d9iaqw0,"All people and even adults should told they have the right to say no AND yes. 

But our authorities do not teach them to assert themselves because authorities want citizens to be obedient not assertive and independent.

That's perfect.  If they can't help you, go to a teacher or a counselor if they have one at your school.  If that doesn't work, call your local child services.  Keep calling until you find someone willing and able to help you, eventually someone will be!",t3_56nqof

Being 15 is confusing and hard enough when things are going well.  It's a strange time and when you go through changes it's incredibly hard to find any kind of mental or emotional balance.  Your stepdad was just as ""not right in the head"" when he was 15.  I promise.  I was obsessed with the Spice Girls around the time I was 15.  We all have stories.  

So not only are you dealing with the normal teenage stuff, you're dealing with mental and physical abuse on top of that.  Yet, you're making A's and B's in school?  That's incredible.  I'm not happy to hear what you're going through, but I'm optimistic about your future.  You have perseverance and you're smart.

The stories I told weren't true but as a child it was easier to tell a made up story than the truth. But my stories were connected to the truth. 

I would dig deeper and see why they're telling stories. Look up symptoms of abuse and try to be a source of understanding. 

Also if the child feels like you trust them they're more likely to tell the truth. If they feel you think they're lying they make things up. My parents never trusted me. I made up all kinds of things. I felt if I told them what really happened they wouldn't believe me ",t3_5o6pry
