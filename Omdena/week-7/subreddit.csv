All those times which you thought was bullying? None of that was bullying. Those were all just harmless teasing and jokes, which you were overreacting to. And all those people whom you thought were bullies? They're not. They never were. In fact, on the contrary, they are actually really nice and friendly people who are just hardcore. You keep wondering why teachers ignored the ""bullying"" but then punished you when you retaliated, well here's your answer: It's not that they were ignoring bullying. There never was any to start with, that is until YOU chose to react to it. Your sheer victim complex led you to falsely believe you were being provoked enough to have some legit reason to retaliate, when in reality, they were just being playful and YOU bullied them over that. You harass those good people over harmless teasing then whine when you get called out on it? Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic. Perhaps if you just manned up and learned to take a joke instead of playing victim every goddamn time, you wouldn't be getting in so much trouble and maybe you'd realize that those ""bullies"" in question are actually really great people once you get to know them. But no, you chose to act out on aggressiveness instead, and now you pay the price, kid. They're not the bullies here. You are. Remember, you brought all this on yourself. You can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to them. You must always accept responsibility. Absolutely no exceptions. That's life.

I am not sure why because she was really friendly with my mother but I do think it had smth to do with her hating on my grandmother (father's mother). Anyways, this woman (Jenna -This is not her actual name. Other names in this text are also fictional ) turned all the kids in the neighbourhood against me using her two daughters. I know this sounds surreal but this woman was stay at home mom and she spent more time with children than other mothers that had jobs. Because of her and her daughters slowly all children in our street started calling me names, refusing to play with me, not allowing me to enter the community pool or play in a tent, sometimes even hitting me for no apparent reason. My grandmother did fight with her because of this but for some strange reason my mother never wanted to. She thought all this was children's game. My mom would say ""Don't worry, God will punish them, you just work on yourself to be a better person and don't hurt others"".

After some time I started hanging out with a girl from neighbouring street (Tammy) and we were inseparable. Jenna then told all the kids to bully both Tammy and me and this was our childhood until we were in 8th grade. Then somehow Tammy started hanging out with Jenna's younger daughter Mary. I never understood how this happened and how Tammy could forget that Mary was reffering to her as ""Retard"" for almost 6-7 years but it happened, they became besties and started bullying me together. I stopped seeing them and found new friends in highschool.

When the HS was over and we were about to go to the university, Jenna came to my mother and said how she wanted to ask my best friend from HS Sonja to live with her daughter Mary when they move to the city where their university was ( I went to the university that was in the capital and Sonja and Mary went to a different one. Tammy stayed in our hometown). Jenna wanted me to say good things about Mary to Sonja. I could not believe that Mary did not have any single friend that wanted to live with her and I suspected they wanted to ruin my friendship with Sonja (like they did with Tammy). At least 100 girls from her school went to the same uni like her but for some reason she wanted to live with my best friend. My mother told me I was just being childish and jelous and that it was time for all of us to grow up and foget the past. Of course Mary started saying bad things about me to Sonja as soon as they started living together and Jenna went on to spread some really nasty rumours about my best friend and her family. So Sonja realized that Mary and her mom were b****** and she moved out. I was happy they did not ruined that friendship.

During our years at the uni I mostly ignored them because I lived in a different city though Mary, her mom and even her father went around our small hometown to say how my uni was s*itty, how I was a s*itty student (in reality I graduated on time and Mary failed 2 years), how my then BF was s*itty... To cut the long story short... Me - everything the worst, Mary - Saint princes with Nikola Tesla IQ whose poop smells like roses... Since my mother always told me to mind my own business, to study and work hard to achieve success that was exactly what I did, though I admit that sometimes I wanted smth bad to happen to Mary and Tammy for everything they did to me and said about me.

Fast forward to today... These b****** have careers, they have ambitious, highly educated husbands with lucrative jobs, smart and beautiful children, they own houses and cars... On the other side there is me... Struggling to keep a job because I can't really relate to people, doing jobs I mostly hate but need freaking money to survive, having a husband who takes on low paid jobs though he could achieve much much more (he is a good man and cares for me but he just doesn't mind being poor), having a 30 years old car, desperatly wanting children and having none... 

I just cannot believe that Karma is being b**** only to me. I swear, if I even think smth bad about someone smth bad will happen to me. Some people literally plot against other people and they live like freaking queens... What is up with that?! And I did work really hard in my life but still I could never get anything I wanted. I am so confused. I hate myself that I think about these people, and I hate that I am envious of them but it is just stronger than me. I don't really wish them any harm but I don't understand why I can't have a stable and normal life. Why do I have to struggle all the time and be ridiculed by them because they keep doing it even now, calling me a failure and provoking my family. Sometimes I think I became fu*ked up and antisocial person because of all this bullying from childhood years but I can't turn back time and make this right. And I know some people will say, Oh well their lives might be perfect only outside... Well my life is not perfect inside or outside. I really want to fight this feeling and stop being envious and jelous but I just don't know how. The stories of their happy lives and successes just trigger me and I start hating myself for feeling like a failure. I don't know what to do anymore. :("
15,I almost killed one of my bullies,44,d53zlp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/d53zlp/i_almost_killed_one_of_my_bullies/,10,1568684032.0,"This happened in elementary school. I was in the first grade of it and never was confronted with any type of bullying. Sadly after this, I got more and more bullied in my school career. It was winter and we always went to this gigantic sports field which was next to our school. I was always kinda preferring it to be alone, so I was playing by a few bushes and made a little hiding spot made of snow and was taking care of my 'snow kid', yes I was childish which I'm not anymore since years now. I was playing by myself until my bullies from the 4th grade showed up who made fun of me and started throwing snow balls at me, the worst part was they put ice into them. I repeatedly asked them to stop because it hurted a lot. They just laughed and kept going, until something just snapped inside me and I just flipped out. I somehow managed to jump onto the back of the bff from the bully and wrapped my arms around her neck from behind and started choking her. She bit my hand but I couldn't feel anything because I was wearing two paires of gloves. I kept choking her until the other bully just broke down crying and begging me to stop and to please let her friend go. I let go of her friend because she was struggling less and got weaker. I told them to never bother me again or to do anything to me, or I'll hurt one of them again. Both were sobbing by now and just nodded and ran away. I'm still surprised today that they never told a teacher that I almost killed one of them, but I'm kinda glad they never told any teacher, I might have been in big trouble. After that day when I came home, I had bruises everywhere because of the ice chunks that were in the snow balls. The ice chunks were so big as a fist. But I kinda taught my bullies a lesson to never underastimate anyone and to never believe because someone is small and helpless, that they can't defend themselves. Since that day they avoided me and just tried their best to not cross paths with me.

16,Celebrating ten years after being bullied with a drawing,42,co2zug,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/co2zug/celebrating_ten_years_after_being_bullied_with_a/,8,1565389112.0,"I drew a hairy fairy girl dancing on a lit up iphone. The subject was inspired by a fake profile made by my bullies in high school ten years ago. At the time I was so traumatized that I left it and never had it removed because I didn’t want to deal with it. It’s still on social media and I am not remotely upset by it now. Because I have tangible proof of the hell I went through and survived. This picture is my small victory against them. I’m glad I get to celebrate still being alive ten years later. The fairy is hairy because the bullies often insulted my body, and the hair both on my head and my body were their focal points. And because I like the look of it. Jammed out to Florence and the Machine during the process.

Others at school had been witness to this but out of fear of the bully wouldn't say anything. Some behavior the bully was known for was urinating and defecating on others' property and having sex in the locker room but due to his aggressiveness and the advantage it gave the school's team on the athletic field, any misbehaviors were ignored by administration.  After the threat, we went to administration with our concerns. They in turn, told my son to be nice to bully. My son was effectively removed from his sports team because the bully was also on it. The coach said he didn't want my son starting any problems for the team. In the end nothing was done. My son didn't feel safe, and we moved for son's safety and mental health. The following year bully attacked another student IN the school, destroying part of the building in the process. He had to be maced and cuffed to be taken out and was expelled. Guess administration and the teachers sided with the wrong student in the search of more accolades for the school. I wonder how many others suffered at the hands of bullies at that school."

This is a message to parents amd future parents, if your child is being bullied, stop that problem immediately. As in if you have a child in elementary school being bullied, you talk with the teacher, principal and the bullies parents now. 

I still remember vividly the experiences I had with bullies. How I had a friend who was bullied just because she was my next door neighbor in elementary school. How they sang ""I love you, you love me, let's get together and kill [my real name]"" in middle school. How when I was actually dragged out of class by officers in jr. High because I actually fought back one of my bullies and the class cheer as I was being dragged out. How in high school someone who was suppose to stick up for me didnt even though he was told to in church. 

It messes with your mental and emotional stability. I have more then my fair share of mental illnesses and I wonder whether or not if I hadn't gone through bullying, if it would've been less of a hassle now or would've existed at all. 

To the young people who still have to go through with this, I'm so sorry that you have these problems. It hurts, I know. And I know the anxiety of having fear of speaking up because of retaliation. I havent been in school for 3 1/2 years and I'm sure that strategies from bullies might've changed. But I'm so sorry that you have gone through what you have gone through and are going through now.

So she didn’t move me, but she placed this girl next to me and her negative reaction made me feel a certain away. It was clear she didn’t want to sit next to me even though I didn’t do or say anything to her all semester. Than her friends kept looking at her and I and were laughing because she didn’t want to be near me for unknown reasons. Nobody wanted to be near me or talk to me all semester because everything I either walked inside the classroom or there was group work, they would isolate me.

27,[Story] Growing up I was very isolated and depressed. I was bullied and for a period of time I didn't have friends. I was weak and out of shape. I've come a long way since then. I want to share my story because hopefully it helps some young people who may be going through something similar.,35,dubyil,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dubyil/story_growing_up_i_was_very_isolated_and/,4,1573424295.0,"A teenager was recently murdered by his bullies in my city and it has made me think about what I went through, and how I can help people so I thought I'd share my story. Maybe it will motivate others who are going through a hard time.

This is the story of the biggest loser in high school. The guy who could never form a group for a group project. The guy who didn't get invited to any parties, or even somebody's house. The guy no girl would ever kiss. The guy who had to eat lunch and spend his breaks alone. I didn't have friends. I was the guy who lived in complete isolation, was heavily and constantly bullied, and raised in a very broken family.

I was mocked, spat on, beat up, ridiculed, slapped around, you name it. I was tormented until I cried, often. No one stood up for me, not once.

During my teenage years I developed social anxiety (which I haven't fully overcome unfortunately) to the point that I could not talk to people without stuttering, I could not order food at McDonald's, I could not talk to a girl, and I could not do anything that made me feel even remotely vulnerable. In some instances the anxiety was so strong that I could not even respond when spoken to. I had zero confidence, no self esteem and no self worth. I still struggle with this because I probably have some post-traumatic stress from all the bullying that I experienced, but I like to think I've come pretty far.

On the other hand, growing up my parents were hoarders and my father a complete cheapskate. My home was a filthy mess. My house was fully neglected. Us children were too. My mother suffered from an immense depression in part due to her illness, and in part due to her dependence on my abusive father, and would spend day after day after day in bed, which was devastating to me as her son. My father isolated us from our extended family, and I went years without seeing them. This did nothing to help my self-worth.

I felt completely alone. I had no one to go to about my problems at school, so I kept them all to myself (and none of my friends or acquaintances today know anything about this). Similarly I had no one to go to about my problems at home. I  spent ALL of my time on the computer, playing video games online or reading forums, as these were the only meaningful social interactions I had. Because of all of this, I was completely out of shape. So, on both a social and physical level, I felt like a literal zero.

Right now, I'm 29 years old, in decently good shape, earning a 6 figure salary, in a relationship with an attractive, confident, highly accomplished woman. I have solid friendships which required a lot of effort for me to build. I own a car, just sold my 1st home, and live a good life. I've traveled, I've had many fun experiences, I've built a successful company, I've pitched executives of multi-million and multi-billion dollar companies and most importantly, I think I've had a positive impact on the lives of the people I care about.

I want to talk about how I got to where I am today, and what I would have done differently had I known.

I was dealt with a lot of bad cards in life. Most of them were completely outside my control, and growing up in the environment I was raised in made me an easy target to be picked on. I think I'm an extrovert at heart, but my past experiences have led me to appear introverted. I feel like a battered down extrovert, in a way. I suffered a lot because of this.

I think a lot of my motivations stem from the fact that I want to feel accepted, I need social interactions, I need to have a lot of friends and family around me to feel good about myself (this is still a work in process). I never sought professional help because I was intrinsically motivated to improve my situation but loneliness and anxiety are still things I have to cope with on a daily basis. Still, I wish I could go back and show 14 year old me what is possible with the right guidance.

Below are the things I started doing in my late teenage years which really helped me, and if your story is anything like mine, these are things I recommend you start doing ASAP. Even if you have different motivators, I think these are key to making a bad situation better.

* Read self help books.  I can't stress this enough. A lot of people mock this genre, but if you have low self esteem then you need this in order to progress in life. Other people may not need this because maybe they were ""raised well"" or learned this indirectly from their parents, but if you didn't, know that these books do help. Here are the books I recommend:
   * Linchpin by Seth Godin
   * The Dip by Seth Godin
   * The Game by Neil Strauss (don't read this from a PUA perspective, read it from a self-improvement perspective)
   * The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck by Mark Manson
   * 12 Rules for Life by Jordan Peterson (I haven't finished it, and the author is very controversial, but your politics aside I think it's a very useful book)
* Exercise. Get in shape. Lift weights. Run. Do anything. Just be active and make this the most important part of your life. This will help you feel better about yourself, it'll give you more confidence, it'll help you get a girlfriend.
* Specialize in something. Learn a skill and get really fucking good at it. This will help you get a job and be successful.
* Put yourself out there. This is so hard, specially if you suffer from extreme social anxiety like I did. You can only get better by allowing yourself to feel comfortable with vulnerability - which means accepting that feeling embarrassed sometimes is OK.

If your life is as lonely and terrible as mine was, you can still do the 4 things above. Do it for present you and do it for future you. Trust me!

Next, these are things I did not do but I think they would've helped a lot.

* Get professional help. Had I realized how easy this is to find I think I could've progressed so much faster. See a shrink, speak to a counselor, just seek help. You don't have to go through this alone and in fact, you shouldn't. If you're a true-to-the-word introvert, then I think this is even more important. Don't stay isolated.
* Avoid drugs and alcohol. Now this is NOT something I was able to do. I was so desperate to finally make friends after high school that I started smoking a lot of weed and binge drinking with people. I still sometimes do this. If you can avoid this or do it in moderation, I strongly advise you do so. You will reach your goals faster. You don't need to get fucked up all the time to have friends.

And lastly, always be kind to people. Always put effort into being a good person. Teenagers often don't care about that, but adults (including young adults) do. Being an asshole may have gotten you social points in high school, but it'll get you no where fast in real life. So make this a habit and you'll eventually reap the rewards. Don't be resentful, even to those who purposefully make (or made) your life hard. Don't waste your energy hating them, because that's energy you should put towards improving yourself. Put yourself first!

My biggest regrets are not seeking help when I most needed it, and not putting myself out there enough. I could've joined clubs, or participated in things, but I didn't because I was always too shy. I would've grown a lot faster had I tried, and I think I would've been a lot happier.

Still, today I'm actually ahead of all my peers. If people from my high school knew how far I've come, I know they'd be shocked. This is a real come back story. But fuck 'em. I don't need to go to a high school reunion to brag or rub it in people's faces. I did this for me. I did it for the family I hope to one day build. And you can do it too!

You only have one life to live, so work on making it the best it can be."

I was at the baseball field one Friday, and out of nowhere Connor comes up behind be and smacks me in the back of the head while I’m holding a baseball bat. I ignore him out of cowardice. He starts calling me every name under the sun, tells me to kill myself, spits on me, etc. I guess I was used to dealing with ridicule like that after years of getting bullied. Then he starts talking about my family. Insults directed at me I can deal with. But insults directed towards my Mom or my little siblings is where I draw the line. I still hold that sentiment today. I swung around and cracked him with the bat. I REALLY wasn’t thinking when I did this shit, because I hit him right in the side of the head. I kept swinging while shrieking at the top of my lungs. I started crying and hyperventilating because Connor wasn’t moving and I thought I accidentally killed him. He spent a long time at the hospital, and I spent a long time at the psychiatrist."
33,Terrible memories of my former life,27,htzfit,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/htzfit/terrible_memories_of_my_former_life/,11,1595189071.0,"I am a 31 year old guy. My personal life has been a misery. I was heavily bullied throughout my life. It began literraly from the day the world laid its eyes on me. I was born with protruding ears and, as you can imagine, people did notice. They made sure to let me know. I was called a number of names, rather derogative terms. Elementary school was hell, you bet. Women, predominantly class mates, but even bystanders in the street, made ugly faces, touching their ears and pulling on them. I was told by a class mate to go kill myself, she even offered her help in the facilitation of the killing. My parents didn't care, or pretended not to notice my plight. Bullying was, as far I was concerned, my problem. I undertook a couple of therapy sessions, sought a psychiatrist, was prescribed drugs to dull all of the feelings that make you a human being. Cut to the chase...I was on the brink of self-destruction. I remember going to the cinema by tram when approached by a young couple. The boy looked at me, exploded from laughter and started making sapian sounds, imitating monkey's movements, touching his ears. His girlfriend was hesitant at first, but the power of evil was stronger and she yielded to it, joining her fiend boyfriend. I was about to kill them both, but I managed to suffocate those murderous desires. I had a realization that day...I could eradicate myself from this world or change my appearance, obviously I did the latter. I found a plastic surgery clinic in my town, I was about to turn 29 that month. The doctor knew I was miserable the moment I set foot in his office. He pointed to my ears and said ""let's have a look."" The rest is history. But in fact, it isn't. I am 31 now, the horrors and dark flashbacks of my childhood and early adulthood are still lurking in the back of my head. It caused me to have a low self-esteem, sluggish speech and a weird obsession with my appearance. I lost all of my friends, because they thought I was a shallow person who cares only about my looks. The question is...how to accept my current self? To love my new look and get used to it? How to cut the connection between my former ""all ears"" me and the present handsome me and become a new version, starting tabula rasa."

""killjoy"" because I do not do substances, ""not a real woman"" because I do not want kids, ""frigid w\*\*\*e"" because I do not do hookup culture (I tried and cried :) so going forward I told myself never again), ""OCD c\*\*t"" because my house is clean - It is just clean, I vacuum, dust and mop on a bi-weekly basis and clean the toilet/bathroom and wash my dishes immediately. I do not walk around the house with a magnifying glass or go shopping in gloves (even in covid season). 

I am 27 now but honestly I feel like I am too old to fit in with my peers and too young to fit in with the oldies.  I have no friends, I have no enemies, I just feel like I am forgotten and fell into a void of someone who does not exist....I message my parents or call them up but they never reply... all my father does is send me stupid facebook videos, but will never answer to what I asked him....my mom usually just sends me the facebook like button and then posts a picture of me and her 10 yrs ago like ""i miss you""... :D boyfriend just plays wow, started ignoring me, even though we had fun together before, we went out for a walk, etc, it was never forced from my side, except on this saturday when we went shopping (for essentials) but dude I don't have a car and we need fabric softener and other things, I cannot carry everything alone...

It's really been bothering me lately. I live a very successful life today but for reasons I cannot explain, I have lately been having visions, flashbacks, and nightmares that occur uncontrollably and involuntarily. 

I need some insight and help please, because I want to be free so badly.

I was socially awkward a lot as a kid. I was also introverted. The other kids made it their mission to take advantage of this and make my life miserable. I remember their names. Corey, Drew, and Michael. They were the worst. 

See, the problem is, I had un-diagnosed Asperger's Syndrome at the time. I did not get diagnosed until I was 22. I was very socially awkward and did not pick up well on social cues. And I suffered so greatly for it. 

What do I see? I can feel and remember kids butting in front of me in line, and them pushing me hard when I try to get back in front of them. I remember being embarrassed and laughed at in front of the whole class. I remember how the bullies would lie to the teachers and manipulate them to make it look like I was in the wrong. I remember being threatened to get beaten up on a regular basis. I remember the principal blowing off my struggles, just telling me to ignore them.  It is one thing to get bullied. It’s another thing to feel as if I deserved it. No matter what I did, there was always something wrong.   
""What are you going to do about it? huh?""

""Laugh one more time and I'll punch you in the mouth""

""Your mother is so stupid""

""You're a bum.""

""Nobody fucking likes you; they just feel sorry for you""

""Oh look he's crying now""

**What's the moral of my story here?** I have two main points. First off, no, bullying is not acceptable. It is not ignorable. And it happens in many schools. Secondly, I am convinced 100% that the school is absolutely the worst place for a good and honest kid. You try to raise them well? School will make sure all of that is reversed. 

Thanks for listening to my vent. I had to write about my experience somehow. These visions hurt me so much and cause me to have frequent panic attacks: at the gym, at home, in my sleep, and even in the cubicle at my office. It makes me feel so sad and so angry. 

What am I going to do now? I intend on going to see a professional. But it's tough to find someone. I have to find someone to help me manage this crisis. 

To sum up my life now, I am a 31 year old male CPA. I am single and I make enough money to live by myself. My economic situation makes me fortunate enough to be free at least in my current state. I do consider myself a success. But these things distract me so much. 

Thanks again, guys. Let this be a reminder that bullying does indeed."
38,It makes me [20f] mad that my childhood bullying still has such an impact on me.,27,i3bp98,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/i3bp98/it_makes_me_20f_mad_that_my_childhood_bullying/,10,1596539680.0,"So I guess I’ve been pretty anxious from a young age, and kind of dreamy/in my head (eventually diagnosed as adhd), but other kids picked up on these traits very early on and ran with it. My first memory of being called a “freak” is from preschool. I was playing some imaginary game by myself with pieces of mulch, kind of talking to myself, when some girl came over, stood staring down at me, called me a freak, kicked mulch in my face, and ran away. 

From that instance, the bullying continued through middle school. I don’t really want to revisit it too much, but essentially I got called “weird”, “spazz”, “freak”, “ugly”, and “creepy” ALL. THE. TIME. In middle school popular guys in particular picked up on it and in addition to the typical insults I was accustomed to, they started a running gag where the premise was how hilarious it would be if one of them had a crush on me. get it? it’s funny because I was a disgustingly unloveable freak. ha ha /s 

Anyways, in addition to this my friendships were pretty sparse and usually ended with someone marching up to me and ceremoniously announcing that they wanted me to never speak to them again because I was weird and annoying and broadly unlikeable. And I won’t deny there was definitely some truth in that, I was an extremely needy, self conscious, annoying little girl. But yeah most of the time I was just kind of friendless and lonely, so I learned to live in my head and eventually developed a sort of selective mutism to the point where staff members at the (small, private) school where I had attended since kindergarten started asking me if I was new. I got really good at not existing. 

In high school, after years of expensive therapy (depression, anxiety, body dysmorphia, and a brief dance with anorexia) and prescription drugs, I started finally making good friends, and gained some confidence, and since then I’ve just kind of been chugging along to the point where I am now. I have a decent amount of friends, I’m conventionally attractive, I’ve stopped needing therapy, and I have a generally positive self perception. 

The thing is, I still carry with me all of the hurtful things people said about and to me as well as all of the ideas surrounding myself, my body, my worth that were planted in my mind. I’m still afraid of being “too weird to be loved”, and I’m still anxious that my friends see me as a burden that they’re just waiting for the right moment to unload. I’ll get depressed about this stuff and close myself off from people I love, which puts strain on my friendships and gives other people the impression that I’m avoiding them. I still have panic attacks about people alienating me or the idea that I’m ultimately destined to be a perpetual outsider and will never really feel a part of anything. I still cry about stuff people said to me when I was 12, and I feel so stupid doing it. I still struggle with the notion that there is something irreparably wrong with me and has been from the start, that I’m a defective human being. 

Quarantine has had me crawling back into my head a lot, and kind of digging into memories I’ve tried to keep buried, and I hate it. A couple of months ago I decided to look up some of my biggest tormentors on social media, and they all looked as smug and carefree as always, going on vacation without masks and whatnot, with at least a thousand more followers than me. I know that doesn’t necessarily mean anything, it’s possible they could be suffering in their own right, but it just made me mad to think about how they had such a profound impact on my mental health and the person I’ve become, while they probably wouldn’t even recognize my name."

40,Still hurt after many years.,28,cga5e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cga5e2/still_hurt_after_many_years/,7,1563809622.0,"Hey guys, my name is Errin, male, and I’m 29 years old. I grew up in a multitude of places mostly San Francisco, New York, and now Phoenix. In all cases I felt people act the same. 

Let’s start with one thing. I am a high functioning autistic, had big nerdy glasses (ok still have them), and just I guess didn’t know anything about society and how it works. Still working on it now. 

I grew up with a girls name I guess you could say. Its Errin, pronounced like Erin. This was one major source of bullying. In elementary school, People would tell me to go hang out with the girls, go with the girls group when the teacher split up the group by boys and girls etc. So I was four eyed Errin. 

But being autistic didn’t help either. I didn’t have any friends growing up, felt like I only had bullies. Always sat by myself during lunch, and I pretty much also sucked at every sport. 

Again didn’t have any social skills, so I did stupid stuff like make dandruff mountains on the table, and then when I got in trouble for it, I literally didn’t know what I did wrong. This was 6th grade. 

People would invite the entire class to a party. Every one was invited except me. This was a class of 25 or so. 

People would go up to a group when I was finally feeling welcome in a group “Oh why are you hanging out with Errin? You should just stop” and they actually stopped.”

“Errin is gay, after all he is named Errin!!”

“Errin likes guys!”

“Errin is a hermaphrodite!” Which I shouted “im not a hermaphrodite!” In the middle of my English 9 class and got in trouble for that. I didn’t even know what this meant as there were no smartphones yet to google this stuff on demand. 

I’ve gotten beaten up on a regular basis. I didn’t have any ability to fight back. It became a high school motto to “jump Errin” 

Got thrown through a metal door and broke my arm. 

Got thrown down the stairs and broke my leg.

Gotten de-pantsed on more than one occasion in PE class. Got kicked out of this class for refusing to change clothes in front of other people. 

Took a trip with the school to Europe With a company called Explorica. People tried to deliberately lose me in a foreign country. This is where they told me to go to “room 224” where they subsequently decided to beat me up, and poured ice down my pants. 

Depression was common and I have had legitimate suicidal attempts when I was in high school. 

You know what sucked? Living in New York City and not having one friend. You know you feel your life sucks when you are in the largest city in the US and feel NOBODY likes you! Even had a teacher named Mr. McLaughlin who told me “nobody has to like you”..sigh. 

I also was subject to a lot of abuse and beating by “parents” who I no longer associate with. They had/have a bout with drugs, alcohol, etc. as well while I was growing up. This is part of the reason I’m in Phoenix, while my parents are across the country still in New York. 

I felt in all instances the school didn’t care. Or just tried to call my drunk/high parents who also didn’t care. Sometimes I am surprised I lived through all of this. 

Here I am 29 in Phoenix. Engaged to a wonderful woman, and have a career in IT. I still have a hard time “getting over” all of this. I have no family here which is a good thing. 

I do miss New York, though it’s where all the trauma was, it was home, May even move back, but not right now. 

Just needed to vent somewhere. I’m sure there’s more."

Hello Bully! How are you? I really hope you are well and that you are very successful. 

Do you remember this? -Facebook link- 

It's a picture they took of me one day I fell asleep at school and posted on Facebook and then they tagged me. I am writing this message because it is necessary for me, so that I can close a chapter of my life that is over (Thank god! Hahaha) 

I have to say that the messages that you put that day - and many other days - really affected me. I think it is not a secret that I have had problems of self-esteem, suicide attempts and even today I am very anxious / uncomfortable during some social events. Maybe it sounds silly to hear it now because if someone now told me that I smell nasty and I never take a bath, it would not bother me so much because it's an insult with very little weight ... But the me who was 13 years old did not know that. 

For a long time I fought against myself thinking that I was a monster, because my hair was not straight, because I had freckles, because I thought I smelled bad and did not know what to do to get rid of that smell (even though my family told me that It was not true.) I wanted to kill myself and I hated myself and sometimes I still feel that. It was not until I left School that I realized that the things you told me (because it was not only was that day, it was constantly, every day, for a long time) did not have weight. 

About a year after our graduation I was recruited to compete in a big beauty competition: that was very therapeutic for me, even though I left the competition I realized that I was not a monster, at least not physically. 

Then the question of my sexuality. You and your group always told me that I was a lesbian. The truth is that I am not, but at that time I did not know that. My sexuality had never been questioned until then and I remember starting to think that maybe I was a lesbian ... only because everyone told me I was. I do not know how to tell you this, because it is difficult to explain if you have not gone through it, but it was very VERY difficult. 

When I was friends with AAAAA the same rumors began to be said again and made me feel so uncomfortable with her. The same happened with BBBBB and most of my good female friends. It was also difficult to have friends because nobody wanted to be a friend of Imnotsmart21 the ""dyke"" Your comments were homophobic and had very real consequences. An example of these consequences? I went to parties, drank a lot, and kissed very publicly with many guys trying to prove to the world that I was not a lesbian. 

Bully, I am writing to you because you are a person that was there till the end. Until the day of my graduation ... I would even say that in the last years we were friends? I really do not know. 

You and many more people caused a lot of damage in my life, I remember that image a lot ... For some reason I always think about that facebook post they made of me. I have never removed my tag and I will never do it. Many people already erased their comments making me look like I had been talking to myself, but I will never erase my comments, and I will never erase that image. I remain firm in what I said so many years ago: At least I will never be like you. 

I always appreciate that I was the person who received so much hate: at least I was not the person distributing it. At the end of everything you only have your thoughts, and I remain calm knowing that I never did as much damage as that which you did to me. I also appreciate that I was the person who received that hatred because I was strong enough to get through it, although I wont lie to you, it was difficult. 

I forgive you. I understand that you were only a girl, and most likely you just went with the flow so that people would  accept you. I wish they would have accepted me too! 

I hope this message is not received in a bad way, I sent it only with the hope of being able to continue with my life. Luckily my experience in the adult world is very different from how it was in high school and I always appreciate that I was able to endure that stage of my life and that I am still here. My boyfriend tells me every day that I am beautiful and that he loves me, and that my curls are the most beautiful in the world, and that has helped me a lot. 

I hope with all my heart that you find a love like ours and that you are very happy. Bully, I really hope you're fine. I do not wish you any harm, never, never, ever. I always see your posts on instagram and you look very happy! I hope that it really is that way and that you are very very successful."

So i’ve been bullied before for about 6 years. I didn’t talk about it or gave it a second thought. I didn’t have 

any friends, during recess i would walk in circles alone around the park, become introverted and became normalised to bullying so much that i would come to 

the teachers with a broken tooth bruises and they just told me to get over it because i was a boy.

Now, i see countless schools saying:’stay strong’ and celebrities do it to. But here’s the thing.

We skipped a crucial step: it’s not spreading awareness, no it’s showing what bullying is actually 

like.right now kids and adults think it’s almost exclusively physical. It’s not the countless bruises that hurt the most, it’s the part of not having friends

These people organise marches and parades against bullying, but it just doesn’t help. Instead of ‘staying strong’ actually act and react."

I don't know what to do. It seems like this is gonna be my life. I fear one day I'll be all alone and no one will be around to stand up for me. I need someone to stand up for me.

53,Zero Tolerance My Ass,23,bcw662,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bcw662/zero_tolerance_my_ass/,5,1555223813.0,"February 20, 2018,  it was a rainy Tuesday where I live. Went to school for what was my senior year and had a whack schedule (my fault on the order I chose my classes) where I went from one side of the building to another (I probably walked half a mile between my 1st to 3rd periods). First was my fourth year of woodshop;  it was nice, relaxing and easy. The second was Computer animation (for things like game development) that was my first pain to walk through a crowded hallway in under 4 minutes. I got there, set up in my seat as I had been for months now and continued on with the period.

There was this one student that was one of my rivals, I'll call him Dick because that name perfectly summarizes him,  for the past 8 years now and today he decided to continue. So a few minutes before class ends at 9:42 (roughly 40 minute periods) he jabbed me in my right side with a pencil walking past me to put his stuff away. Out of impulse I reach back and slap his books away without even looking. Nothing of it.

Until he decides on the return pass to do it again and so I do it again. At this point, the bell is 2 minutes away and the teacher stepped out to get ready for hallway duty as the other students gathered up to leave. I get up from the left side of my chair when Dick is just standing there on the right side facing me with a smile.

He says, ""You know (my name)..."" and goes **ballistic** trying to punch me in the head. I manage to bring my arms up and grab him by his hair (he had really short and greasy hair so it was surprising I even got a grip) and had my arm against his neck. He managed to get one good hit on my cheek as afterward, I found the right side and bottom gums were bleeding.  I managed to regrip him, pull him away, and without thinking slammed his head down with nearly all my strength and upper body weight (at the time I was a fat 187 lb) into the backrest of my chair that was nearly between us.

To remember, these are the metal bar with solid plastic that when they break looks like they're made of stone. And ended up bring the left side of his head down so hard it made the chair ring like a bell.

&#x200B;

At this point, what I think were freshmen lining up on the opposite side of the room coming in for class had watched the whole thing with us, after the chair impact, breathing heavily and staring each other down. I was red hot and ready to go if he tried anything. But that's when I noticed the damage; a massive lump like someone had just implanted a baseball into his skull with a vertical gash large enough to be considered a coin slot big enough to fit 3 half dollars side by side at once, and for the first 5 seconds it wasn't even bleeding.

So after this, I stand there,  he goes over to get tissues to try and stop the excessive bleeding and has calm as he could he says to not tell anyone about this and that he just fell down the stairs. From that, I packed my stuff up and tried to continue on with my day, until Lunch hit.

Our lunch basically allows anyone to sit anywhere, but if you're in a group you usually find a place to stake your claim and that's where it is for the rest of the year (until they rearrange the table placement).  I go through line, get my food and go seat with my 7 friends that we all consider the Edge Group (because of the ungodly things we discuss and are nerds for the most part) and that's when I start hearing the rumors that I had stabbed Dick with a pencil and the first time I heard that he had to actually go to the hospital for several stitches.

Day gets hectic until period 7, Economics, and at the time we were going into the part back buying Stock. This class is the kind of class that I just want to duck tape everyone's mouths shut for how shit they are making me surprised I didn't go ballistic in there. Everyone knew about what had happened and was desperately trying to get me in trouble. After some pointed out the blood on the floor, the teacher originally saying it was ink, after actually checking realized it WAS blood, and all the shitheads of the class pointing the finger to me, he looked me dead in the eye like he was asking what to make of this and I gave him an angry deadpan.

To put in an aspect of the teacher; he is both scary and funny when he wants to be. And for the years he had him I was one of his favorite students. But when someone pissed him off, half the school could hear him. And this was the times when it was the latter and took me out into the hall. Knowing what was coming I packed all my stuff (wasn't gonna leave it there with all those little shitheads) and outside on the other side of the wall away from the door he unleashed his thoughts. Just about seething what he said and how this made him look. I gave me my response (unfortunately don't remember what I said) and went down to the principles office.

This is the part of where the title of this post comes into play. As like a lot of these schools nowadays they ran on a serious Zero Tolerance Policy on Bullying.

I go to the office and the head principal and police officer that goes around school grounds (like every other school has) waiting there. At this point, I know reality was moments away from hitting rock bottom. They explain what the situation was, how it painted me in the light, my side of the story of what happened (as Dick had already left school) and side that this was a lot bigger than I was prepared for. They asked why I didn't get a teacher, and for a span of 2 minutes, I repeated that 'the event happened within 10 seconds. How (the fuck) was I suppose to get a teacher?'

They told me I was being immediately suspended for the rest of the week and called my father in to pick me up early and took me home.

At home I had him sit down and talk about what happened. While most parents wouldn't like their kids getting suspended from school he actually congratulated me in defending myself. As Dick was the one to both start and escalate it the situation, I was in the right to defend myself.

Well, not according to this crack house of a highschool. As Zero Tolerance dictates that if ***you*** raised a hand against the one being aggressive to you than you are just as much in the wrong as they are, even maybe more so.

So the week goes by and it is now February 26, I walk into school knowing the shitstorm I'm about to get hit by will not be merciful. I was lucky that at the time the I got in at the 7:45 bell, anyone before that arrived at the school would stand in the commons area in front of the cafeteria or go get breakfast before 7:45 to go to their lockers/first period. When I got to my locker, unloaded and headed to first period, a *lot* of people were asking what had happened. As Dick still wasn't back yet and no one fully knew what happen.

In woodshop that day I sat in my usual spot at the tables where 'class' is gathered and while the students there did annoy me sometimes to just a degree below Dick they didn't even try to say a word to me. Those who did ask about what happened and I repeated myself again. Though this time several of them actually congratulated me in putting Dick in his place after all the crap he's been doing to me after all these years.

This continues for most of the day, especially into lunch, where while some still believed the pencil rumor they had gotten the gist of what happened and said I was still in the right.

Tuesday comes and rock bottom decides to hit.

The School, not Dick, the *School* is suing me on charges of disorderly conducted and heavily injuring a student. When my father found out about this he wanted to go tear the school a new one; saying no matter how much it cost he would hire the best damn lawyer he could get for me and fight this.

Come next Thursday on the day of the court hearing the officer, representing the school, and me representing myself, stood in front of the judge with no one else in the courtroom except my father for support. The judge read through the case and after we all waited 10 minutes for Dick, as apparently he was also suppose to show up, let the Officer go first how then asked for the charges against me be dropped. Judge asked if I had anything to add, said no, and the case was closed.

BUT that wasn't the end of it.

Till this day my father and stepmother that I live with are still pissed off about what happened and my stepmother was ready to go to the newspaper with the story about how fucked up the Zero Tolerance Policy is.

On a side note: I was the only one to actually get in trouble, as Dick was out for most of the time and I'm pretty sure he still has the scar to remember it. And what's funnier was that he was actually part of the school's wrestling team."
54,High school bullying started a chain reaction that destroyed my life (23M),22,i6epcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/i6epcv/high_school_bullying_started_a_chain_reaction/,14,1596982967.0,"Got bullied since I was 13 until I was 17 (the worst years were when I was between 15-16).

Name calling, they put my backpack in the trash once, as well as pushing me from the stairs once as well, insults, rejection, laughing at my face and behind my back, doing social experiments with me, manipulation, asking for my help and using me as a tool to then discard me, indifference and so on.

They only stopped because the vice principal told them I tried to kill myself using a belt with my hands, and probably because they were afraid of consequences.

Graduated from high school... Everything went downhill from there...

Since I had unsolved trauma, anxiety and depression from past bullying, I didn't do well at college **(at least in the social aspect)**. 

Made mistakes in college, tried to fix them, but only made everything **even worse**, to the point rumors were saying that I was a **retard**... Which led me to think I possibly had Asperger's or something similar...

**Made the mistake of saying that to almost everyone I knew, fucking up my existence so much that it made me suicidal again**.

Worst part is that, **I never had Asperger's, as I'm neurotypical. But most people think otherwise, and that pretty much fucked up my entire existence.**

Flunked out from my first career, went to a new one, **made the same mistake again**, got treated like a **child or mentally challenged person**, drifted away from countless people, including those I met from **high school, college and sometimes even the internet**.

Right now... I'm very close to be **100% alone**, without counting family.

Lost almost everyone, I can't even connect with people, have been with tons of psychologists, I even took some anti-depressants for a while, but they didn't work...

In therapy, they tell me that I can't change everyone, and that I can only fix myself, so I must learn to ignore what everyone else thinks and just focus on my life.

**I have to fix everything, not just my mistakes, but the damage others did to me as well, and if I don't do it, then it's my fault that I'm suffering for not changing.**

Life is a **living hell**... Just studying, doing homework, wasting my time in the internet, trying to ignore the pain as much as I can to not make my family worry, trying to keep the last dying embers of friendship I have alive...

Sometimes I like to think that I have most of the blame, like 60-65% to it, or that I probably deserved it because I was so annoying, childish and naive when I was younger, that I bothered others so much that they **bullied me as punishment**.

Probably it's too late for me... Seven years of hell can't get away that easily...

Hell, even yesterday, I was somewhat calm when my mom got a call, from a customer who was **accusing me of hacking her What's App account, despite I tried to explain to her that I never did that, not only she didn't believe me, even when I sent her an audio with my mom's phone to clear misunderstandings, but she kept saying that it was my fault**.

Told my family: **""if that doesn't convince you all that I'm hated by people just by existing, then I don't know what will.**"

There was a class bully 3rd-5th grade who would get physical with me and make fun of me.

But ah...the biggest thing I realized today is my own sister was my biggest bully.   
I never saw ""sibling rivalry"" as bullying. It's sort of accepted as a norm in today's world. 

  
But psychologically, I'm coming to accept it is bullying just like anything else.   


She would make fun of all my mannerisms,  
and constantly look for things to criticize about me

We got physical a number of times, and I can vividly remember one time when she kicked me to the ground. It really hurt, and it's quite clear in my mind.

When someone's mean to me, I find that I hold back on lashing out because I'm afraid to hurt THEIR feelings by doing so. I find that I'm unable to take positive reinforcement seriously and believe negativity more easily. Here's roughly what things have been like. 

My father has mental health issues and my mother doesn't work well under stress. I always had to hold back on lashing out, making a fuss, showing displeasure. Otherwise someone would have a breakdown and it would be my fault. 

 I was constantly bullied through almost every stage of school. I went to an all girls school and was bullied for my looks, my habit of reading,the way I spoke, the things I liked - pretty much every aspect of my personality. This of course came with the usual mean girl tactics that female bullies love so much- manipulation, rumours, lies, the works. I have been the bully on some occasions, but I've come to realize I got bullied far more often. 

 This pattern continued through high school, and college too. In my final year of college, I now realise that I always find myself friends with groups of bullies. I haven't dated a lot, but the one guy I was with for a year was the most toxic bully you can imagine. Otherwise I functioned fine, I kept up my grades, but I was depressed and lonely all the time because nobody seemed to have one good thing to say to me.

 It's not that people didnt though, but I'm seriously incapable of taking positive encouragement seriously. If someone was good to me, I thought they lacked judgement. If someone bullied me, I took the negatives to be the truth. 

If you've read till here, please please share your thoughts on this with me. I don't like discussing this with any of my family or friends because it's sensitive to me and I don't need their judgement on this. So if you understand, or relate, or know someone who suffers from a similar experience, please share so I know what the hell is going on with me."

It means a lot.

So I was in the 7th grade I believe when it first happened. I had only been at this school for a year because me, my mom, and my older brother had just moved in with my grandma before 6th grade so we had to switch schools. I can't say I had too many friends, but I had a few. One that will be a Key person in this story was a very good friend of mine, who I'm simply going to refer to her as Roxy, because she always looked more like a Roxy to me which was very cool.

she was pretty well liked through out the whole school, she was funny, nice, and always telling jokes making people smile. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE liked her, besides the usual popular girls who didn't like anyone who didn't really like anyone. This semester we sat at the same table with a bunch of other girls, who I normally wouldn't hang out with on a weekend, but we were all pretty good friends and got along well, and I liked being near them.

Anyways, I don't remember what the conversation this time around was about, mostly because when it happened I was spacing hard, with my ADHD it happens a lot. I just remember hearing the punchline and laughing myself out of my seat. The day went on as normal and being it was a Friday I went home and spent the weekend at a friends house.

The next Monday, Roxy didn't show up. I figured she was sick. But she didn't show up for at least 3 days before it happened. Now I don't know how these rumors started in the first place, but only that I remember someone in my art class asking me something, but because we didn't get along well, i had a headache, and I couldn't hear her over some machine that was on in the room, I just shouted yes to her and walked away. The very next day, a friend who I'm going to call K, came up to me in literature class and he asked me why I got Roxy suspended.

I instantly was in a panic. This was the first time I ever heard of anyone being suspended. but Roxy? I asked K what he was talking about. Apparently, Roxy during lunch, (probably when I spaced like I said above) had joked about people she didn't like and if she would kill them or not. all fun and games just kids being kids. she mentioned a gun and that's what got her suspended. Now mind you none of us were talking any serious things about shooting up a school. It was more of along the lines of the game ""kiss, marry, murder"" game. No one was serious I cannot stress that enough. But apparently someone mentioned it to their mother, who called the cops, who contacted the principle and Roxy was suspended for a week.

I was completely in the dark until now so I asked him why come ask me about it. He told me that the rumor going around was that *I* was the one who told on her. I was completely shocked. I told him that this was the first I was hearing this and I had no idea she was even suspended up till this point. He believed me and we went on with our work in class.

For the rest of the week I had to deal with death stares, questioning by multiple people, and people just generally being a bully to me. I even had a note slipped into my locker that had a very aggressive message which, I won't repeat here. But I will say that I ended up crying for hours when I got home. I was even bullied at my bus stop which put myself and another kid in danger, but I'll tell you that in a different post.

When the week was over and Monday rolled around, I could not wait for lunch and tell Roxy the truth before she heard the rumors. I only prayed she would listen. Unfortunately, I was wrong. When I got to the table this is basically what happened.

Me: Roxy, before you say anything I have to tell you-

Roxy (holding up her hand to stop me): I think its best that we just don't talk anymore.

I was heartbroken, and started to silently cry. I didn't even go up to go get my lunch. The entire time the WHOLE table was backing me up saying that I didn't say anything to anyone. I don't remember much because of how distraught I was, and right after I had to go to my flute practice after lunch. when I went in I sat down and started to bawl my eyes out. my teacher sent me to the principles office and I calmed down. I explained what was going on and why I was crying and he called down K and another person who I had mentioned by name who believed that I didn't tell on Roxy. They explained that they were trying to tell people I wasn't the guilty party but no one was having it. I was sent back to class and for the rest of my 7th grade year the bullying continued.

Eventually I guess everyone forgot or I just didn't notice it anymore because I was too focused on my studies. I will say that bad thoughts entered my mind more than once, though I never acted on them. To this day, I don't know if Roxy thinks I did it or not, But Roxy, you know who you are, and if you're reading this? I am so so so sorry for what happened and I hope that you can forgive me and maybe we can talk and reconnect again. I would love to talk to you again."

62,One of my bullies is dead.,23,88mzia,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/88mzia/one_of_my_bullies_is_dead/,7,1522571357.0,"When I was in second grade (age 7-8), I was walking home from school with a girl who was one of my friends, carrying a cool walking stick I'd found.  An older kid walking in front of us was tossing a ball around, and at some point it went off across the street.

He approached my friend and threateningly told her to go across the street and get it for him.  She started to tremble and was obviously scared - the kid was known as a bully.  He shoved her, and that's when I lost it.  I told him to leave her along and he hit me.  I struck my walking stick as hard as I could across his back, and while he was doubled over in pain, I took off running to my house, which was pretty close nearby.  He chased me, but I made it in the house before he could catch me.

Thereafter, he and three of his friends bullied me relentlessly, for years.  I was kind of an Aspergers kid and had a very hard time dealing with this or telling anyone.  My parents knew, but essentially did nothing.  The teachers knew too, but because I wasn't in the same grade with these assholes, it didn't affect me in class - only in the hallway or on the way home.

One day, two years later, I was walking home, and the bully's friend - I'll call him Todd - came up and punched me and immediately broke my glasses.  I started crying.  Somehow I got away.

A year after that, I was playing tennis with my brother in the park across the street from our house.  When we were walking home, the second bully, Todd, grabbed me and told me that he was going to smash my face in. Then he punched me.  I swung at his head as hard as I could with my (metal!) tennis racket, causing a gigantic bloody gash on the top of his head - then ran home!  Almost a repeat of what happened in the first incident, just with a different guy.

The fourth major incident (slightly later, in 5th grade)  - there were lots of small ones - was when the originally bully was in the hallway in school, saw me and and punched me.  At this point, I was a basketcase.  I was traumatised every day just trying to get home from school.  I had migraines four times a week.  So I absolutely lost it - I just went apeshit on him, punching and punching him, until I knocked him into a tall metal television stand and he cut his head pretty badly.  My mother was called, I was told that this was a serious issue . . . but my mother and my teacher and the bully's teacher all told the principal that the bully was a major problem and I was a smart and well-behaved kid, always nice and friendly though rather shy and withdrawn.  His father, on the other hand, said that his son's issues were his son's alone.  

I won't get into all the ways this affected me throughout my life, but I'm proud that I'm a strong person now and do my best to always help people, especially those who need help.

Today, it's more than four decades later.  I was speaking to my mother the other day and - for some reason - the subject of bullying came up.  She told me - I never knew this back in the day - that the bully I'd whacked with my tennis racket suffered severe head trauma as the result of it, and even *his* father said he deserved it.

I got curious, so I looked up bully #2 and talked to some mutual acquaintances.  It turns out that he was accused of rape twice and never amounted to much; apparently he also abused his wife, who later left him.  But the salient fact is that he died about three years ago . . . from a brain tumour.  

Was there a connection between my defending myself against an attack and smashing him in the head and a brain tumour four decades later?  I have no idea.  But it feels somewhat karmic.

How do I feel about it?  I'll admit to smiling a little.  It doesn't sound like he learned his lesson or ever became a better person.  I don't want to gloat on that - I'm also sad that whatever potential he had was so squandered on a short life, and that's always a pity."
63,My Bullied Story,22,fxsytl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/fxsytl/my_bullied_story/,7,1586469815.0,"I am currently 23 years old. I have been bullied since the early days of Middle School. 

One day, during 6th grade, one of my friends noticed a small bald spot on the top of my head. As soon as he said that, more and more people quickly wandered over to me and started looking at it. I quickly became numb, and just sat there and waited for everyone to leave from the site show. Over the course of several months, this bald spot grew bigger and bigger. I talked with my parents about this, and they just said that it was caused by my genetics. Unfortunately they felt that it wasn't such a big deal, and for some reason they didn't take me to a dermatologist about it or anything. 

At my middle school, when you arrived everyone would just sit in the gym waiting for classes to start. Every now and then, while I sat there waiting for classes to start, the girls behind me would literally poke the bald spot in the back of my head and start laughing. I would just sit there in shock and disbelief, and wouldn't say anything due to my overwhelming sense of embarrassment. This would happen on a more frequent basis, until I ended up moving spots in the gym so that it would stop happening. 

I was on the middle school basketball team as well. I wouldn't get bullied as much while on the team. But one day, the coach, in front of everyone, said ""Do you have a bald spot on the back of your head?"" Again, in pure disbelief, I said nothing. It was probably the most obvious answer to that question, and it didn't need to be asked in the first place. 

Also, as a final note during middle school: People would constantly tell me to ""turn around real quick for me"". I then asked ""Why?"", but they also said ""no reason"". It was pretty obvious as to what they were referring to. Everyone wanted to take a look at the bald freak. 

High school was a little different. By then, everyone at school knew me as the ""bald kid"". Instead of constantly questioning the fact that I was bald, people just simply didn't talk to me. I guess I was seen as sort of a freak, which caused me to have little to no real friends. This also helped cause me to have social anxiety, and felt as though I would never be accepted as who I was. 

This entire ordeal still effects me to this day. Today, I still have little to no friends. I was in the Air Force for a couple of years, and now I'm out. While in the air force, I luckily made some friends. But I am now out of the military and back home, where I again have little to no friends. I feel alone and empty almost constantly. I have self diagnosed social anxiety, which doesn't help at all. I am clueless as to how to make any real friends. Everyone that I grew up with is either away at college or somewhere far away. Now, I am saving up money to hopefully get a hair transplant, so that I am no longer haunted by my past. 

Thank you to everyone that has read my post up until this point!"

Did you know that 13 people were being very horrid to me, but 5 other people were actually bullying me at the time that you were bullying me?

Did it genuinely make you feel cool?

Did you enjoy being a bully?

How much did you actually know about my life?

What was wrong with me that made you want to bully me?

When did you realise you wanted to make me the target of your abuse and harassment for another 3 years?

Did you ever think you should stop being so mean to me?

Did you pick on me for any particular reason?

Like could you see a reason why I deserved that?

Did you really hate me as much as it looked like you did?

Did you ever worry that I would harm myself because of the damage you were doing? (Stupid question)

Did you actually want me to move schools because of you?

Did you mean anything you said to me?

Were you ever unnerved by the amount of damage you were doing?

Did anyone ever come to you and say “I think you should stop bullying her/ you shouldn’t do that” and try and discourage you?

Was tormenting me and teasing me a positive thing in your day?

Did you ever care about how it made me feel or how it was affecting me? (Stupid question)

Do you have a rough idea of how much damage you cause to me?

If you could go back in time, would you be telling yourself not to do it or would you be encouraging yourself?

Do you regret bullying me?"

I have barely any memories from these years, but idk if it was because I was feeling very suicidal and depressed at this time. 

I had some close people die to me before I started high school and my parents worked full time so I never confided in them emotionally. 

I was in a friend group and I think I might have been too annoying or desperate for attention at this period , but one day, someone from this friend group confronted me and said that I was annoying to be around. 
I think from there for around two years, at school no -one ever spoke to me. I hung around them but they just never acknowledged me. They never were mean to me past this extent, but just kind of forgot my existence idk. 

I have some issues with self esteem and social anxiety and idk if I'm just overacting, but I always have wondered what was wrong with me or where they came from.

68,My Story,21,disoow,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/disoow/my_story/,10,1571275935.0,"I was an 80s kid.

I lived in a extremely violent home where domestic violence was the norm. My mother and father were constantly arguing and it turned violent at times.

I remember the incessant yelling that went on every evening. My two brothers and I tried to keep ourselves distracted by playing with each other. I remember one evening in particular: they were both screaming at each other, and then there was sudden silence. Without saying a word, my brother and I looked up at each other. We both flew downstairs and found our father on top our mother with his hands around her throat.

Through the next several years I would witness my father break my mother’s nose, crash his truck into my mother’s car (hitting the passenger side where I was sitting) and missed me by inches.

The most violent episode I can recall was my father coming home drunk in the wee hours of the morning. My mother actually slept in my room that night because she was afraid something might happen that night. Sure enough, I was woken by complete bedlam. When I woke up, everyone; my mother, father, both brothers were in my room. My father was literally trying to kill my mother. He was a madman and overpowered us all. He got her down to the floor and started to pull her by her hair to their bedroom. He then opened up the second story window where he then attempted to throw her out of.

On top of all of this, I was severely bullied in middle school. It was mostly verbal, but there was one particular bully who physically assaulted me in the locker room a couple of times. I would often feign sickness to avoid going to school.

I had no safe place.

I am in my late 40s now and have been experiencing PTSD type symptoms.

I came across the story of Greg Barrett a couple of years ago. He was physically bullied incessantly because his real last name at the time was “Gay”.

He confronted his childhood bully who happened to be superintendent of the very school system they both attended. He spoke up to him during a meeting and called him out at what he did to him while they attended school together. The superintendent laughed and dismissed his claims. Others have since come forward and affirmed they witnessed the bullying.

That inspired me.

I began to look up one of my major tormentors. He’s a 3rd grade teacher at a local school. I found his email address to try to open a dialog, but he had never responded.

A few months ago, the older, bigger  kid who physically assaulted me in the boys locker room showed up in my “People You May Know/Friends Suggestions” wall feed on Facebook. I messaged him, and asked a mutual friend to contact him to let him know I was trying to get a hold of him. I never heard back.

About a week ago, I looked at his profile and saw he had a couple of public posts. In a drunken stupor; I left several rants exposing what he did to me and how that had affected my mental and emotional well being at the time and still does years later. I shared how I grew up poor and in a violent home and how he added to my misfortune by his actions.

I woke up the next morning and discovered he deleted all of my comments. When I tried to view his profile later on that day; I discovered he blocked me, as well. I asked my wife to see her phone and looked him up in her Facebook account and sure enough he still has an account which confirmed he did indeed block me.

I actually found this to be the proverbial salt in the wound. He terrorized me with physical violence in school, but he couldn’t handle a few words from me?

I’m really messed up these days. I’ve been self medicating with alcohol for over 5 years and take Xanax to try to help me cope. I started experiencing anxiety and panic attacks some years ago.

I’ve never felt suicidal, but maybe I’ve been attempting to commit suicide unconsciously through my habitual drinking. I make cocktails and I usually consume the equivalent of 15 one ounce shots of 80 proof liquor per day. Sometimes more.

I’m just trying to silence the demons.

I would like for just one of my many tormentors to come forward and admit that what they did to me was horrible, but I won’t hold my breath.

I’ve read up on psychology and learned about cognitive dissonance. These people will never feel bad about what they’ve done. Nobody views themselves as the “bad guy”. In their minds, I deserved the bullying the same way a rapist blames his victim by saying, “She was just asking for it.”

Don’t know what to do next. I have violent ideations that I know I’ll never act on.

I sought out professional mental health this past spring. I took an MMPI, but it came back “invalid”. I took a shorter one back in June, but the doctor never bothered to get back to me on that.

I feel like a ticking time bomb. I feel it’s just a matter of time before I snap. My mental breakdowns are becoming more frequent and more violent. I’ve had to have my wife tie me up to keep me from punching my face and it’s starting to become harder and harder to explain to co-workers why I have bruises on my face.

I don’t know if this was the right thread to post this on. Feel free to remove it if it doesn’t live up to the standards.

Thanks for reading."

They grabbed me and throw me into that room and closed the door. The lock and the light switch were outside, so they locked me in and turned off the lights. I was crying and screaming but no one heared me because every one was outside. 
I was there for like fifteen minutes until the teacher noticed I was not in class, the people who locked me there said that I was in the bathroom, so the teacher went to search for me, because I was late. When she entered on the building heard me crying and opened the door. 
When the teacher asked why they did it they said it was an accident, that maybe they didn't saw me And because they were talking they didn't hear me.
I told the teacher it was I lie but they didn't believe me.

72,Help me stand up to the mean girls?,20,hev6uj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hev6uj/help_me_stand_up_to_the_mean_girls/,14,1593005948.0,"Standing up to adult mean girls?

I’m 20 but I thought stuff like this was supposed to end in high school :( 

There’s these girls that don’t like me. Really it’s only one, but she’s gotten three of her other friends involved. The one girl doesn’t like me because she thought I liked her boyfriend. I didn’t though!! And am happily dating someone else. But I recently found out her boyfriend liked me before they got together and I think that’s really why she’s mad. They spread rumors that aren’t true, try to get other people that I don’t know on their side, and text my boyfriend false rumors to try and break us up. 

The main issue is that no one tells me these rumors directly, the people they tell them too just sort of stare at me and I feel really anxious, like they’re judging my every move. Fortunately there’s one girl on the inside of the friend group who tells me all the things they say and will show me screenshots of their conversations. But she wants to be completely anonymous so I can just go up and confront them directly because I’m not supposed to know what I know. All these girls hide under the facade of being nice. 

I’m generally a quiet and submissive person and I think this makes me an easy target. Do I stand up to them? How if I can’t tell them how I know they’re being mean?

The whole situation is ruining my life, please help. I live with these people in a college setting year round and I can’t avoid them so is there any advice to stand up to them?

73,My story of being bullied and how it has impacted my life.,20,h90i3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/h90i3o/my_story_of_being_bullied_and_how_it_has_impacted/,8,1592193317.0,"Greetings. I am here to tell the story of the bullying I went through as a child and how it has affected me to this day.

I have always been a very introverted person. As a result, I never felt like playing with other children much and preferred to read. This caused me to be singled out by my teachers, who were convinced that something was wrong with me. They frequently called my parents to inform this and believed that I had autism, even though a doctor had stated that I wasn’t. I consider these events to be my first experiences in being bullied and singled out for being who I simply am.

During elementary school, I never really experienced any bullying while at school. However, at the daycare that I went to before and after school, I was picked on extensively, both by other children and the staff. One incident that stood out was one where some kids made it seem like I had said a curse word when I hadn’t, and the staff took their side. I was greatly infuriated by this and resented everyone there after that. I believe most kids saw me as an easy target due to me being thin (which I still am to this day).

The worst was yet to come unfortunately. After moving during the middle of my 7th grade year from Maryland back to my birth state of Arkansas, I ended up in a school where I was not welcome. The bullying I experienced here was even worse than what I encountered in Maryland. I made friends when I arrived that ended up turning against me some time afterwards. And there was one kid who harassed me relentlessly and even shoved me into some rocks. The bullying I experienced was so bad that I started hearing voices telling me to strike back. I began masturbating in front of the kids who picked on me and even tried to sexually assault the kid who pushed me into rocks. I miraculously never got in trouble for my attempts at exacting revenge against my aggressors. By high school, the bullying subsided somewhat, but the damage had been done. Any attempts that people made to reach out to me were met with me pushing them away (metaphorically). I spent my teenage years in front of my computer playing video games rather than partying, dating, and doing other things that teenagers typically do.

As of this writing, I am 25 and live a pretty isolated life. I live by myself in a house that I own and have completely paid off. I live in a lower income, somewhat run down part of my city that has a reputation for being unsafe. I choose to live where I do because I resent mainstream society and feel like a misfit in it, even though my part of the city is not a place where one would expect to find someone like myself (I’m a white guy with an upper middle class background). I work in the IT industry, but have been unemployed for a little over three months now after quitting my previous job. I’m still a virgin, have never had a girlfriend, and have never kissed a girl. I am still very angry over all the bullying and rejection that I experienced when I was younger. Chances are, I’ll never get over it. After all, as the saying goes, “you can’t outrun your childhood”."
74,Adult bullying 😟,21,gmow4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gmow4m/adult_bullying/,31,1589924900.0,"This is my first reddit post.

talking about this as an adult seems so utterly childish, but it haunts me regularly. i was severely bullied for all of primary school (7 years) and it continued throughout all of high school. in primary school i was bullied about being adopted, and being the only child in school that had curly hair. one girl in particular made it her life's mission to make sure she got me down in all ways possible, and it got to a point where i cried every weekend, begging my parents not to send me back to boarding school (i roomed with my bully, which made everything worse). her mom was on the school's parents council, so the staff turned a blind eye to what was happening, even after my mom objected and tried to stand up for me. 7 years i had to deal with this.

so finally the time arrives to go to high school, and i made sure not to go to the same school as my bully, because heaven knows I wouldn't have survived it. but then along came my new boarding school roommate, and my newest bully. I'll just call her M.

I wanted to be friends with her, and at first  she would be really cool and nice towards me, but that all changed quicker than i could fathom. M went out to destroy every aspect of my life. She spread a vile rumor about me to get my boyfriend (my first true love) to break up with me. when it ultimately worked i was absolutely heartbroken, and she just sat in our room laughing at my pain. she did numerous horrible things to me, including physically abusing me whilst filming it all and sending it to whomever she pleases.

it's been 4 years. i still get anxiety attacks. hell, it's 01:30 in the morning and i can barely breathe because i am still so sore, heartbroken and anxious about being bullied. i was bullied for so long, i have convinced myself that it's what i deserved. it really hurts, and i have a feeling it will never go away. 

i don't know what to do anymore. i feel like this part of my life is dragging me away from the normal 'happy' person that i am. what possibly could i do to make this feeling go away?"

They never paid for anything!

The principal did a poll and said that most people were anxious of the teachers. Well, I was anxious of seeing my classmates, not teachers.

In my school there are some specialization when you arrive at the 2nd superior grade (9th grade for you Americans) and I opted for IT and telecommunications.

Sadly, ALL my classmates opted for that too for teasing me even this year but...

Yesterday, the principal called my dad and told to him that she changed class to me and the specialization will be the same I opted for!

79,"My 8 year old son was lead out of camera view, then jumped by 3 other boys who repeatedly slammed his head into the ground... school is not working with us whatsoever. Said it’s done & are expected to drop it..",19,bfodc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bfodc4/my_8_year_old_son_was_lead_out_of_camera_view/,16,1555878988.0,"Warning: super long, sorry. It’s a lot of info to explain. If you take the time to read, i would love all the advice I can get. 


Okay, so I’ll do my best to explain the situation as quickly as possible. I have two boys who should be up anytime lol But we are currently in an extremely messy situation. I’m not really sure what to do next or how to go about doing so. And I honestly don’t think things are going to change, but I have to fight for my kid. I have to. 


To start I will explain my son in a nutshell. Not like it matters, there’s no excuse for physical violence.  But he’s a good kid. A really good kid. Super smart, raised all his grades go straight A’s this semester!! so he’s super smart, but unfortunately he doesn’t connect well with other kids. It’s my fault. I waited too long to put him in pre-k and didn’t have him around enough kids as a younger child. Therefore, he just doesn’t know how to interact with them. He thinks they’re being mean when they aren’t. He thinks they’re being nice when really they’re picking on him. We’ve had a couple situations already with bullying that have been dealt with and handled by his school. And we were extremely pleased with how the situation had gone. My son even started being “friends” with the kid that was bullying him last month. Turns out he thought my son was someone else. Not right either way, but he was really apologetic. My son just doesn’t have the confidence he needs or that he should have. 


So fast forward to Thursday... have I mentioned that these 3 boys that jumped him, my son thought were his friends? I wish you could’ve seen the confused look on his face. He just didn’t understand why they did what they did. And he is terrified of it happening again. The one boy he was sort of close with lead him out of camera view to two other boys. Who he also thought were his friends. So obviously he didn’t think much about going over to them. That was until the shoved him down on the ground, the first boy ran off (not to tell) while the other 2 had him by his arms, not letting him up. One boy slammed his head while the other told him to stop. But yet the one yelling still wouldn’t let go of my son. He even tried to run away and they caught him and continued. This went on forever. For a ridiculous amount of time. Not one teacher broke it up. Not one teacher saw it. My son was laying there screaming for help and crying, and no one would come. Finally another 8 year old boy heard my sons cries and ran over to break it up. So they took it out on him too. Pushed him down and had him crying too. But at least it stopped it. (I thank God for this kids parents for raising him to do the right thing!!) 


So my son is bawling his eyes out. His teacher is on recess duty and asks him what’s wrong. HA! When my son tells her do you know what she freakin does? This is the teacher who we absolutely loved and she has been so patient with getting to know my son and helping him get out of his shell. She’s encouraged his writing & drawing so I hate having negative feelings towards her now. But the way she handled it makes me sick. The first boy who lead him to the other two has gotten in no trouble or whatsoever. I don’t know why he’s not being included because he definitely should. He trapped my son. Set him up. At EIGHT YEARS OLD!!! But the punishment the other two get is hilarious. She made them each clip down ONE box on their behavior strip. That’s it. My son has to do the same for talking in class. How are those two comparable? Oh, but it’s not even over there. After recess they go to specials which is music/gym/art etc.. well my son is so upset after all this (obviously) that she makes him sit in the timeout corner cubby so he can “calm down.” He missed all of specials while the other kids got to go enjoy them. 


THEY NEVER CALLED ME!!!!!!! I have class one day a week. Go figure it’s on Thursday’s. So I got home around 8 or 9 and didn’t find out about all this until then! Started calling the school on Friday... the office people said the principal was busy blah blah. So my husband left a message with her explaining the situation and how we didn’t want him going out to recess. She acted sick over it all.  Still hadn’t heard back so I emailed my sons teacher twice. She finally emailed me back a couple lines saying that she would email me back after lunch. She never did. 6 1/2 hours later the principal called me instead of my husband. I’m sure he thought I’d be a pushover. But instead I didn’t answer and had my husband call him back. When my husband called me back he was livid. 


The principal spent that 6 1/2 hours investigating what went on. When he got that note from the secretary, he had no knowledge of any of it. He said he reviewed the footage and that it wasn’t caught on camera, but when my husband asked if we could see it. He obviously said no. Said that he can’t show it to us because there are other kids seen on video. So you’re telling me that a teacher could molest my child and I can’t see the footage? Anything could happen and I can’t see the footage? These people... smh. He then went on to explain that he didn’t think the punishment handed out the day before was enough, so he had added to it. But again, wouldn’t tell my husband. He said he would call the kids parents that night informing them of what happened and to let them know their child’s punishment. My son got home shortly after and gave me an earful. Their punishment? For the next week they have to miss TEN minutes of recess and they have to eat lunch alone. That’s it. For pre-meditating an attack & actually carrying it out. He proceeded to tell my husband that this is typical play for 8 year old boys on the playground. I don’t think typical play results in a child having to go to immediate care. I really don’t. My son is swollen and has marks all over his cheek from being slammed into the mulch. This punishment these boys received is the same punishment these kids would get for talking in class or not listening. How are they comparable even a little? They’re not. On top of that, the principal talked to our son with these boys without our permission. These boys admitted to everything without a problem. They “apologized” to him in front of the principal. My son will tell you straight up that they said it because they were scared of getting in trouble. And you know how I asked the school that they not be directly around each other until all this is taken care of? They sure didn’t listen. Instead, my son was forced to be in a group with the main kid. After he had told the gym teacher everything that happened. Her response to him? “Yeah, well you have to get over it. You guys are in the same class so you have to be around each other. I’ll try to keep it in mind NEXT time.” Stupid bitch. So I emailed her immediately. I kid you not, it wasn’t ten minutes later that I had the school calling me. So you can call me over a shitty email immediately, BUT not call when my son gets beat up? Not call us right back when we leave a message saying it’s an emergency & even explaining what was going on. What a freakin joke of a school. This principal preaches about bullying. Clearly he’s all talk. They TOLD my son he had to be friends with these boys. HAD to. Hell no. 


He told my husband it’s done. It’s been handled & taken care of and there’s nothing more to do. My husband asked for a sit down with him, us, and the other parents. He said no, that’s not necessary. Said we could meet with him directly, but the other parents don’t need to be involved because it’s over with now. These people are supposed to protect our kids and keep them safe in the time they are with them. How am I supposed to send my son somewhere for the next 3 weeks that he doesn’t feel safe? That I don’t feel is safe either?? 


I don’t know what can or will come out of this. I really don’t. I’m feeling helpless, to an extent, as a mother.  Not knowing what steps to really take next. I’ve been advised to go to the news and newspaper. And also to file a police report. I keep hesitating and doubting/questioning my actions because I HAVE to keep my sons well being in mind, too. I don’t want to make him hurt anymore or cause things to get worse for him. But at the same time, I want him to learn that sometimes when we believe in something, awe have to stand up for what’s right, regardless of the consequences. He’s having a hard time accepting it all. I hate this for him so much. He should’ve had to spend his evening at the doctor getting looked at. He shouldn’t be going through any of this mess. It truly breaks my heart. 


Please teach your children to be kind. To say hi to the kid playing alone at recess. To stand up for what they believe in. To always do what’s right, no matter what situation they’re in. Teach them to be strong and  confident. Teach them to stand up for themselves if they have to. Just teach them to be kind, decent people. ❤️ 


Also, don’t ever think you have to give up because someone else tells you it’s done. I’m nervous as hell to fight the school, but I intend on making this known to any and everyone that will listen. Our kids deserve better.  


I hope you all have a wonderful day. Squeeze your kids and kiss them extra today. Just for them being them. 💞"

81,For Many Years I Was A Victim Of Bullying.,18,ia9fzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ia9fzm/for_many_years_i_was_a_victim_of_bullying/,3,1597534573.0,"Around the age of 7-8 years old I started getting bullied in school, with what started off as name calling and belittling turned into being hurt physically. 

A day that replays itself in my mind to this day was being shoved to the ground and being kicked into by 3 people. I remember eventually getting home at heading straight to the bathroom where I locked the door and broke down. I never told anyone for years. I was ashamed and embarrassed that I couldn't protect myself. I had several bruises on my legs but they were easily hidden as I always wore trousers to school instead of skirts. 

The school I attended was being demolished as was another, these schools were merged and put into a new building. The bullying escalated, this time it was different people and more of them. I hated school more than I ever did before.  Not only did the other people in my class pick on me, many of the teachers seemed to dismiss it. During a parents evening my mother and brother witnessed me being bullied, after we left the school, I admitted it. I was distraught that anyone found out after all these years of keeping it to myself. 

High school really tested me, the bullying became much worse and more physical than ever. I would skip classes and count the minutes until each class would finish. It felt as though most teachers were against me too. Someone had to created a fake Facebook account in my name and were rude to many people in my class and year group, some I barely knew. No one believed it wasn't me who owned this account. To this day I have no idea who really was behind it. I eventually opened up about being bullied as I got to the point where I didn't want to continue living. My mum removed me from the school and enrolled me into a out of area high school. I had 0 friends and by this point had next to no self confidence however my life improved greatly. I didn't dread school as much anymore, I made friends too and even came home with a smile on my face instead of tears in my eyes.

I was bullied up to the age of around 14 years old and it has impacted me negatively for the most part but I am no longer embarrassed or ashamed to have been bullied for so long. I can accept that I wasn't the problem. The problem lay with those who chose to bully me. I know how hard it gets and how often you want to just escape it all. Please don't give up if you find yourself in a similar situation. Absolutely no one has the right to take your life away from you!"

83,"Hello, how can I stop feeling anxious when I go out, How do I deal with being forced to take othet people's shame and being ashamed of my self when I go out when random people on the street or bus make fun of me, I cant self isolate forever, I want to be brave and not kill my self?",21,hhbzkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hhbzkn/hello_how_can_i_stop_feeling_anxious_when_i_go/,13,1593367853.0,"Let me explain and make it short

Due to family abuse and peer abuse ever since 7th grade I isolated my self. High school has been hell, I have never cried my self to sleep as much as when I was in high school. Sometimes on the street people I am not close with recognize me and since they are loud they talk to each other how ugly I am. I know because they have said my name. One time I was on the bus and was on my period, I did not eat anything since I was in a rush and I felt terrible as if I would puke, these middle schoolers pointed with a finger at me and made fun of me quietly, when I glared they smirked and looked away. I do not understand what in me makes people think it is okay to bully me. One time it was warm and I had terrible greasy hair. To cover it I put on my black hoodie of my winter jacket and some kids approached me and started to ask me what my name is and laughed with their friends. 

I do not understand them. But it is enough to ruin my week. Usually during the summer i self isolate since I have no friends and no one to go out with. Even if I ask them they are usually busy. I am not sure if my middle and high school bullying groomed me to be like a magnet for future bullies and that scares me. Besides suicide, what should I do? I cannot handle bullies alone, never could. The bullying continuies for years and it becomes so hostile that I asked teachers for help. If i could stop it on my own i would. I have been traumatized by this topic to the point of asking my mother every day and every night if I am beautiful and if I deserve to live just because some idiots told me every day that I deserve to die, no one likes me and that I deserve the abuse. 


I cannot feel any joy and refuse to feel happy. When i was bullied i felt fakely happy to spite them but that only encouraged them to make even bigger hits. I hate boys. I do not know what to do.

All I wanted was friends. Someone next to me. Not to be used as a class clown in order to be popular. 
I always go out to the store in fear and in disgust. I am tired of being a slave to the four walls of my room but when i do try to have friends i mess up. Plus friends come and go. I feel like i will die without husband and children and want live to just end. 

The bullies always thought of tjem selves as joking and will never take responsibility, hell they do not even remember me. I hate my self for being so sensitive and crying so much. I take some medication to make me brain dead but it does not always work. I am tired of my self and this life. I want to live, to explore the world, to give for charity, not be forced to live day after day in agony. How do I shake off this victim vibe. The only solution I see is that I should be emotionless like everyone else to not be bullied, because when I am overly happy and talkative I am bullied. I hate people and their cruelty. I do not know if i will ever be happy since helping people made me happy but they do not want to be helped or changed."
84,Had an oral exam about bullying. Teared up while taking it.,19,gj1g2r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gj1g2r/had_an_oral_exam_about_bullying_teared_up_while/,9,1589413366.0,"So today I had the graduation oral exam in spanish and before we begin we have to randomly pick an envelope which contains an unknown text about whatever topic. Got the bullseye when the topic was about cyberbullying/bullying. I have experienced this type of harassment when i was a kid and I didn’t think it would still make me tear up to this day. When I had to talk about it on a more personal level I started to tear up — not actually cry but just two tear drops rolled down my face. It was very sentimental since the time when I was bullied was a very lonely and shameful period of my life. The exam itself went well, probably the best I have ever done in an oral exam tbh. But I’m just ashamed and embarrassed that I couldn’t hold in my emotions. It’s always been a problem. 

I don’t know why but I’m getting negative feelings about my past. Did I really go through all of that? Did my accuser/bully really do all those nasty things to me? It doesn’t even feel real. Even if it is real, I can’t help but feel bad that I cried— it was something really spontaneous and never in my right mind would I have thought I would get sentimental in that exam... Am I guilty? Is it normal to feel like this? I feel like the teachers think I’m using this as an excuse to get a better grade even though I think that my performance was already great. Even my parents knew what happened and thanks to them, I got over it once that horrible, control freak, two faced girl left school. Still, I feel like its so... surreal? 

Its been a quite a while since I’ve experienced bullying but it was a rough time as a kid- it was always the same bully who ganged up on me with her friends. I thought I could control my emotions better than before but now I’m back to square one. Its pathetic. I wish I hadn’t cried, I feel so, SO embarrassed; embarrassed about my past and my sudden tearing up scene.

Nevertheless, I’m glad that I was able to regain my posture and mental state fairly quickly after the teachers gave me a few seconds to breathe so that my voice wouldn’t be as shaky anymore.
I apologized to them at the end since I do feel bad for ruining the exam."

I have recently been diagnosed with severe social anxiety and even simple social interactions for me are extremely stressful and emotionally exhaust me. I've lost friends, love interests, important opportunities and even family due to my anxiety. Every day I have to be around ANYONE is spoiled by this constant stinging fear of saying something to trigger something negative that might make someone harass me. I digress however, essentially has anyone ever had their bullies approach them and apologize, or confronted them years later? Any ex-bullies that might have apologized to their victims or were confronted? Tell me your stories!

86,Is it possible to get flashbacks from bullying?,18,fmdonz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/fmdonz/is_it_possible_to_get_flashbacks_from_bullying/,5,1584819440.0,"This is my first post so hopefully this is allowed. 
I’m 19F, and was bullied by this girl at secondary school from the ages 13 - 15. She claimed that I said something racist about her Asian friend on the bus, and proceeded to ‘confront’ me and shout it out on the bus so people would stare. I remember running home crying, and after that she’d always pick on me, trip me up, laugh at me  on the bus. She’d always shout out my name, or tell people she was with to avoid me etc. 

I still have dreams of being humiliated and severely manipulated to the point where I feel like I have to kill myself so I feel ‘free’. 

I’ve seen her in person after that in a normal setting (last time was a funeral for a classmate) and although there was no mean comments, she still had the same superiority complex. 

Even though everyone from primary school (where we were first friends) has grown up and most likely forgotten things, I can’t. I can’t just ‘get over it’. I have these nightmares/dreams a couple times a month, and I’m always having to commit suicide to ‘deal’ with it. 

I feel like it’s just a part of me now which I can’t shake off. I can carry on as normal as I have life stuff (studying etc) but these flashbacks are starting to affect my self esteem. I’m starting to hate myself for not ‘moving on’. I have a trend of just ditching people when they do something wrong (like I won’t speak to them ever again/pretend they don’t exist) and I rarely tell them, I just stop contact, or extreme feelings of just laying into someone so they feel bad for upsetting me (I’m aware I’m just projecting, never done it btw, I just never speak to them again).

I thought I’d got over it but my subconscious hasn’t. I don’t want to succumb to the nasty things she says to me in my dreams but it’s like a bad smell that I fear will be there for the rest of my life, just when I’m asleep. 

Does it/will it get better? I write down my feelings and have had sporadic counselling but when I’m stressed, these dreams come back and make me feel worse and I end up in a downward spiral. 

Any advice on whether it’s worth trying counselling again or if anyone feels the same way?"
87,I’m Getting Bullied in College,18,el8acr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/el8acr/im_getting_bullied_in_college/,47,1578411018.0,"I start back school January 13th, and I’m honestly so nervous to go back. In some of my classes, my peers openly laugh and make fun of me every time I speak. Guys in my classes even talk about how ugly I am every time I walk by. However, the experience that has affected me the most involved a faculty member. 
One of my college’s administrators called me fat right to my face with no hesitation. I’m a part of my college’s student government, so me and some other members decided to pass candy out to students and faculty in between classes. She came to our setup and inspected our signs. I innocently offered her some candy...and she said the unthinkable. Verbatim, “No thank you! I don’t want to get fat like YOU!” I’m dumbfounded all over again just by typing this. The other two people with me just sat there in shock. I did not know what to say, but somehow I found the words “Oh, you’re not fat.” The only thing the other two with me could do was look at me in pure disbelief. I pushed everything to the back of my mind until I got home. 

I cried because this one cut a little deeper. It hurts coming from people my age and on the same level, but it hurts even more from a higher up especially since I have to report to her sometimes. 

I have been suffering this abuse all of my life, and I can’t seem to get ‘used to it’ or ‘grow thick skin.’ It makes me scared for my future"
88,Thought Process From Bullied People,20,egutpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/egutpy/thought_process_from_bullied_people/,7,1577589397.0,"Bullying can occur in various forms across all ages. I have browsed a few threads and news paper articles to see the comments that people have regarding bullying and what irks me is when people blame the victims for ""not being strong enough"", ""no resilience"", ""just ignore them"", ""welcome to the real world kiddo"" and other forms of horrible phrases. I understand that many times, we speak out due to the experiences we have had in life and we like to think that everyone has the same experience and perspective that we do but everyone is unique, especially in their thought process and how they react to a situation.

Children and young adults that bully others in a school environment usually have an ""advantage"" of sorts, whether they have a big group of friends, are physically larger or have parents that enable their horrible behaviour.  Bullies tend to target and pick on individuals that are physically weaker/smaller than them and have less or no friends to support them, or kids that have a non-existent support structure in their life. Bullies start off mildly, to test the waters and see who they can pick on easily that can't or won't retaliate or put up a weak fight. Bullying can occur verbally, physically or a combination of both and it is not a once-off situation, it happens every day as children and young adults HAVE to attend school, it is compulsory. The bullies will continue poking and prodding their targets until the victim snaps one day as we all have a breaking point. Once the victim snaps and fights back, whether it's verbally or physically, it sets off a chain reaction. The victim loses because the bully and their horde of friends will cry to a teacher of sorts and since it is many voices vs one voice, the victim loses.

Individuals who have been bullied undergo an interesting thought process as they are bullied. At the start when the bullying first occurs, many individuals do try to prevent the situation from repeating itself by asking or telling the bullies to stop, in some extreme cases, some individuals struck out and in all these cases, they just became a target for the rest of their school days. Initially, many of these individuals will try their best to ignore the comments or assault that bullies lay onto them, but, the verbal and physical abuse wears down their patience as it happens on a daily basis, sometimes, multiple times in the same day. The thought process initially begins as a hatred for the bullies and the abuse they dish out. Over time, the thoughts change to wondering why other students don't step in to prevent the situation, why teachers don't intervene and why they deserve such treatment. As the victim's patience wears thinner each day, they become desperate to get out of the horrible situation they're in and seek help from friends, teachers, family and anyone who will listen. For the unfortunate victims where no one will provide support of any sort, they begin to lose hope. Their thoughts change from hatred to self-pity, frustration at the lack of help/support from the hundreds of bystanders in their daily life, anger at life in general for somehow choosing them to be the victim of a situation that never needed to happen and anxiety from fearing the inevitable trap that school attendance brings, more bullying. When an individual spirals into a depressing mental state, they become desperate for a way out. Many people try their best to talk to others to seek advice, anything that could be the faint light in the dark tunnel they see themselves in. When bullied individuals have exhausted every resource available to them, they find themselves backed into a corner with very few options left. Some of those options are to fight back the bullies, knowing they cannot win, or to end their life as they believe that the rest of their life will never improve as every person they turned to for help just turned a blind eye on them. 

For those that like to blame the victims of bullying, please try to understand that in many cases, they did nothing to attract the unwanted attention they received on a daily basis and they do try to seek help, support and advice regarding their situations. Instead of pointing at the victims and blaming them, perhaps we should be more open minded in talking to them, asking them what happened, what they did, what they've tried and what they plan on doing in the near future to see if we can provide support, instead of adding fuel to the fire of their hellish nightmare and blaming them for a situation they never asked to be in."

1. Suddenly you imagine yourself being bullied either by your loved ones, and friends or your past bullies come to get you

2. You imagine them destroying your life, like a soap opera

3. You remember all of your past mistakes and your painful memories and that leaves you depressed.

4  you get depressed whenever your friend turn you down on your offer on going out to play d&d or go shopping

5. The only way to alleviate that pain is by video games or eating good food

I obviously cannot stop people from bullying. But I can help you.

TBH it's my dream to get this post known because I want everyone to know that they don't deserve to be hurt, and everyone is equally beautiful.

All of us have a story. Every single one of us. And everyone deserves a healthy life. You are so beautiful, you just don't know it. Because of a few people who bullied you at school, or one bad day, are you really going to moan about it? Your bullies are insecure, bored. They have nothing to do. They are secretly jealous of you, which is why they spend their time talking about you. No one cares. The more you get insecure of them, the more they enjoy. This time, just ignore them. They don't have anything to do with your life. Forget them. Show them that you don't care, so they will stop too. It's not snitching if you tell the teacher/an adult.

Do stuff that you're good at, what makes you happy, and believe that you can do it. Listen to happy songs, play games, and watch vines and comedy shows. Memes. There's so much you can do. **Talk to someone!** There's always someone.

Including me. If there's anything on your mind, happy or sad, talk to me. It will make me feel so much better, and you too. Even if you stubbed your toe, talk to me about it. I'm obviously not a professional mental health specialist, I'm just a random teen. But I'm a friend. Email me on my unofficial email: [rain.drcpss@gmail.com](mailto:rain.drcpss@gmail.com) Don't feel afraid or unimportant to talk to me. You don't even have to tell me any personal information.

In elementary school, things were decent. I had a decent amount of friends and got along with most classmates. I’ve gotten bullied by some girls who thought that they were better, but hey, it’s 6 years olds, so it doesn’t phase me now. But I’ve been bullied some in elementary, I’ve had my stories. It was around 5th grade when I started to be more quiet and more antisocial which was something I couldn’t control, i just didn’t know how to have a conversation. I didn’t have any friends to talk to in class, so it was pointless. A lot of kids saw me as the quiet kid in my class since I never talked. I was bullied more often then; I was definitely the unpopular kid in school and was recognized as the “odd” or “gross” kid, maybe because I never looked as pretty, maybe because I was chubby, I don’t know. I started to become suicidal in 5th grade because I was getting teased by everyone and the teacher. I can understand a joke, but 10-11 year old me didn’t really take it as one. 

Middle school starts, and that’s kinda where my memories of being bullied happens the most or so. I’ve been teased whenever I was near a football player or someone popular something like that. I’m not sure why I was teased. I kinda kept to myself and was friends with people who were bullied as well. I didn’t ever try to act popular. Never tried to have a reputation of myself. I was normal. I had a couple embarrassing moments, but otherwise, I was innocent. 

Now it’s high school. I still get bullied occasionally for no reason. I guess they try to make me entertainment as the tease me or throw something at me. I never did anything to make myself known. I’ve been mature for most of my life I feel like. I didn’t have to act like a class clown in all my classes to impress anyone. I know I don’t have to be funny to have friends. I’m completely normal entering high school. Freshman year I got teased a tiny bit. Sophomore year was a bit more than Freshman year. I didn’t do anything to embarrass myself. I just sat down in a class full of most of the popular kids and got teased by some. A few were not bad. The “class clowns” got a laugh though. The whole point is why I am I still getting bullied? I’m a normal kid. I don’t gossip about other students. I don’t have a lot of friends. I stay to myself. I make good grades. I don’t do anything! I’m not super ugly, but I could be to some. I’m not super obese, but I could be to some. Why is it me, a normal average student, to be criticized into being “abnormal” and the be considered as the black sheep when I’m just like anyone else. In fact, I feel as if trying to fit in or trying to make yourself known is more of something cringeworthy rather than staying to yourself. Why am I the chosen one? Why?"

24 gay male here

Just a thought thats been bugging me, so since primary school ive been bullied, yes boys did hit me and bully me, but after primary school the pattern stopped. Girls however since primary (mean/aggressive/nasty girls not every single girl obviously there were nice ones) but girls always picked on me, in high school it was a nightmare, they always try in gym class throwing stuff at me deliberately etc, i mean why on earth?? Like wtf, and they usually had this menacing grin, from highschool ones, to university ones to even in my ex job, there was a nasty girl who took joy in seeing me alone, quiet, i am reserved, polite but i noticed guys dont seem to care much regardless of whether i am more reserved or have a bit of social anxiety (not that ive ever told people i do) but there is always at least 1 girl that is sooo so nasty to me on purpose and she always picks on me, laughs and others seem oblivious..what kinda message is god/life/whatever trying to give me?

Can anyone explain why or relate?"
97,Long-term effects of bullying.,18,df1s5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/df1s5p/longterm_effects_of_bullying/,2,1570578367.0,"Hey,

this is not about me being bullied currently, but more about how it affected me and my mental health. Plus a piece of advice I have for anyone currently suffering through it.

I was bullied throughout basically most of my school career. My parent's take on this was (in their defense, they had no idea, it was just meant as general advice and it only hit hard due to the circumstances I was already in) that I should basically ignore them and eventually the bullies would grow tired of me not showing any reaction.

It didn't stop and I started to feel embarassed, like there was something wrong with me, since they didn't move on. My friends at that time ignored the bullying. No one actively experiencing it ever stood up for me and thus I never felt like confiding in a teacher, since I was afraid that they'd side with the abusers. My friends noticed that I was starting to withdraw from them, but instead of asking me what's wrong, they just told me to smile more. As a result of that. I did. I laughed when I felt like crying. I became incredibly sarcastic in order to hide the fact that I did actually have feelings and that I cared. As a result, I eventually started to repress my negative emotions enough that I got numb and now...Well, I am 24 and have severe depression.

I am currently undergoing therapy to deal with this and some (unrelated) trauma caused by my Mum. Why I still wanted to post this here, besides no immediate need for help on my behalf?

Because I want you to know that it's not shameful or embarassing to speak up. It took me way too long to realize that. Maybe some people won't understand. Maybe they'll even put you down. It doesn't matter, move to someone else. There will always be at least one person to listen. What you are experiencing is not okay, neither is it your fault. Don't ignore them. Don't endure it. Fight them. But if you can't. Don't try to take them on yourself. Talk to the people, who love you.

People, especially kids, are sometimes cruel. Don't blame yourself if they target you. You are not damaged. You deserve love.

And to those of you, who witness stuff like that happening. Talk to the people. If you are afraid of confronting the bullies, talk to the victim in private. You have no idea how powerful just having one ally can be. Just because they don't seek you out, doesn't necessarily mean that they are fine with it. (Unless you just do it to make yourself feel good. People usually notice that. And it doesn't generally resonate well with them. Chances are they'll feel even more alone.)"

100,My bullying story.,18,9nyfl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9nyfl9/my_bullying_story/,10,1539503318.0,"TL;DR: More than a decade of bullying, nobody did anything, my psyche is a trainwreck.

My first bully was a schoolkid. I must have been...4? 5? He was...6? 7? I remember barely anything, aside him berating me, shoving me and twisting my arm in the sandbox.

He invited me to his birthday party, just before I moved away from that town, at age 5. So that part lasted for at least a year. He invited me before, I think? He showed me a crossbow once. What a weird relationship. I know he did things to me that are considered abuse. Insults and causing pain, like twisting my arm and shoving me around. And yet sometimes he was nice to me. Might that be the reason I never defended myself later? Because I always waited for my abusers to be nice again?

Anyways, his birthday party: I went, with a present from my parents. I remember a vague image of a garden and balloons. Then...I am in his room. There were people inside. Nice people, I have never met before. We talked. I was welcome. I was treated well. Then he came in, shouted ""what are you doing in here?"" and grabbed me. Wresteled me out. Maybe punched me. Why didn't anyone notice or do anything?

We moved to an even smaller town. New house, I still remember the smell, the light flooded hallways and rooms. How friendly it looked.

Kindergarten. I wasn't well received with the kids. Nobody knew me, I knew nobody. I guess I was excluded. I can vaguely remember being mocked, and always being put into some demeaning role in plays.

Then grade school. A blanket of nothing in my head, with few holes to peek through. An insect. A Dragonfly. Dying in our yard. It touched me, I didn't want it to die. It died. I went to school sad that day. Went to the bathroom and cried. Another student saw me, asked why, so I explained. I returned to a classroom filled with mockery, with the student I just opened up to yelling ""HE CRIED BECAUSE OF A DEAD INSECT"". There are some feelings associated with this. Distrust. Anxiety. I was already tense back then, so the bullying must have already started. The kid I opened up to, I distrusted him. Patrick. He was one of the bad ones. Yet I opened up to him? Was I mad?

More nothing. Another memory, crafts lesson. Timo. The most vile shitstain of a human being I ever had the pleasure to witness. True waste of oxygen, prefered murder method: Smothered with a pillow. Not worth the bullet. Not worth dulling a knife for. He was a terror, I remember that. His name, face, demeanour, his impish, narcisisstic grin burned into my memory. I just don't remember what he did, except this. Crafts lesson. His smacks. Open hand. Hard. In my face. I was 7. He was, too. I cried. I ran to a teacher, a substitute, a dragon of a woman, feared and reviled.   I told her what happened, completely beside myself. Sobbing wildly. She retorted nobody would take me seriously, if I spoke in so much panik. I walked away.

Then the chronology goes FUBAR. I cannot remember what happened when.

I remember having a few friends. Pascal. Lars. Dominic. Pascal and Dominic abandoned me, likely because my reputation faded. Lars abandoned me in Grade 5, years later. I remember physical bullying. Being beaten. And walking up to my abusers and being beaten again. Likely the pattern established long before. Hoping they would be nice again, someday. I remember an older kid from a higher school, that shouldn't have been there joining in. I remember being held, by 2, and then repeatedly being kicked in the ass. I know Alex was in it, can't remember the other ones.

The rest of the bullying these years is ablur. I remember being mocked in sports and arts. I remember hiding from my bullies. I remember walking through hallways being shouted at, but it's too vague.  Although, one thing stands out in clarity, an advice, a mockery, I received from the school principal and my teacher, Herr K.: ""If you were more approachable, the other kids would maybe like you more"".

Thank you for that advice Herr Kramer, a figure of authority I held in higher regard at the time than my parents. Fuck you. Fuck you, you fat old, dumb, insanely degenerate, neglectful fucking piece of shit bastard. You are dead now, and I hope you suck insane amounts of cock in the deepest pits of hell. You knew my story. You did nothing, but blame me.

When Grade 4 came to its end, my father grew increasingly concerned about my future, and the pressure was on. So I went to a regional Gymnasium, a high-tier school in germany. And I got lucky. My new class had none of the bullies in it from before, although most of them went to the same school. But one old Friend, Lars, the one whose friendship would soon begin to fade. I was an outcast. But I wasn't mistreated. At least not in class. The schoolbus was another ordeal.

Very few memories, still. The bus rides took half an hour, and in that time, I was free game. They were all older than me, at least 3 years, and I have no idea why they targeted me.

4 stood out most.

A very fat chick, akne all over her face.

A fat boy, also akne ridden skin.

A turk with a slim, bony face. He was the oldest.

And a boy with a really ugly fucking face. A mouth like a fish. He called me fishmouth, and even back then it was clear to me he projected.

They insulted me. Cornered me. Sat on me. Screamed at me. Took my hat and my backpack. They returned it before i had to get off the bus, likely to avoid trouble. I don't know how long that went. At least through 5th and 6th grade? Shorter? I don't know, I can't remember.

In grade 5 some other things happened. I had an enemy, Tobi, who I later befriended, shallowly. A girl died in school camp from a heart attack. My grades dropped considerably.

Then shit really hit the fan. Grade 6. I had to choose languages at the end of Grade 5. Either french or latin. French seemed like a lot of work, so I chose latin, and thus was moved out of the class I was left alone in, into a class where 2 of my former abusers were. Alex and one other I can't remember. I don't know how fast things went to shit from here, but I guess it was swift. My schooldays became nightmares. I was insulted daily, I was stolen from, lied about. I don't remember physical abuse. I remember being locked into a toilet until an older student freed me. I remember spending whole breaks in the toilet, to be left alone. I remember hiding. I am fairly certain the bullying in the school bus continued during these days. And I remember the Turk and Fishface following me home, him on a scooter, threatening me. A scooter means he was at least 16 years old. Bullying a 12 year old. If I saw some motherfucker doing that today, I'd kill him. Or I'd at least try to break his fucking skull through his helmet with the ball peen hammer I keep handy at the door.

My grades went down the shitter. Naturally. The schools reaction was a joke. I was called to the principal. To talk about my ""denial to perform"". He aknowledged that I had trouble in my class, but I had to think about my future. To a 12 year old. Only a teacher can have his head so far up his ass to say that.I was sent to the school psychologist. A young woman. I don't know what we worked on. I know nothing changed. I know the bullying didn't stand out to her.

&#x200B;

My standout bullies this year were all new faces.

Christoph, fat loudmouth.

Timon, not Timo, the other one, but Timon, a weasely looking weasel of a boy.

And a fat fuck with a face round as the moon, whose name I don't remember. He was extremely slow, but his parents rather wealthy. I guess his grades got a little massaging.

My grades couldn't recover. I didn't have the ambition either. I played video games in my free time, I got them from Games-magazines I bought with money stolen from my parents.  My parents weren't really keeping up the pressure on me, they were more concerned about my sister, who went to the Hauptschule after grade school. Hauptschule is the lowest tier of schools in germany, Gymnasium being the highest.

Now a lot of memories start to clear up, because I repeated 6th grade. And I found friends. I was never invited to after-school activities by them, ever, but we were friends in school, and that was nice. In the breaks and in free-hours I still had to hide from bullies, but it got a lot more relaxed. The second 6th grade was easy, because I did most stuff from memory, in 7th grade my grades crashed again, and I had to leave the Gymnasium, to Realschule. I was unable to concentrate on learning or homework at this point. I had nightmares keeping me from sleeping. I remember feeling physically cold and mentally empty every day before school. I spend most of my free time playing games, and nobody cared.

I got lucky again, got a good class, in grade 8 of my new school. Found friends, again, this time I was even invited to after-school activities. It wasn't deep friendship, but it was more than I had for a long time.   But still bullies followed me in the breaks. There was two groups from paralell classes. With a gnome called Lucas, and a big brawler called Christian in one class, and a guy we called ""Monkeyass-Face"", who mocked me whenever they got the chance with his group. His real name was Mario, as I found out years later, after we had an encounter at a party at which I punched him and drove his head into a doorframe.

The bullying continued in sports class and in the breaks. Until I was 15. I remember that day rather well. Christian followed me with his gang. Threw little paper balls at me. I turned around. Shouted at him what the fuck he wanted from me. He said something. My knuckles connected to his face. His to mine. We traded punches. Kicks. He connected more, but I was impervious to pain. I rushed in, held him in a half-assed chokehold. At that point we mutually decided to take a break. The day after he got into my classroom, with his gang, and apologized for his behavior. I can't condone his behavior before, but I respect him for that. He was the one bully that showed something like honor.

That was the point, at which the worst of it ended. Some continued. Monkeyass-face continued his bullshit until 3 years later, at said party. Some more fights with other people. That was it. What followed was a time of drug abuse, speed and weed mostly, bad german hip-hop, and anxiety attacks as I tried to get more socially competent and failed. I graduated with a mediocre Fachabitur, the second highest school degree in germany. Then I left school. It's now 5 years later. Regular insomnia, deep depression, self loathing, anxiety and the inability to connect to other humans rule over me. I work minimally and live with my parents at the age of 25. I wanna die nearly every single day.

There was a lot of shit going on at my home. My sister was suicidal for some time, and a raging borderliner for some more time. She was bullied, too. My parents were constantly fighting, and both are dealing with some mental issues. But I am certain, what fucked me up most, is that every single day, for more than a decade, I had to live in anticipation of someone aggressing against me.

I don't exactly know why I share this. I am seeking therapy right now, and wanted to write it all out to give my therapist an impression of what was going on.

If someone made it through all of that, thank you for reading."

Either way, I took years of his abuse until the 8th grade trip. They had a pool there. I was on a swim team and a very strong swimmer. One day in the pool on the trip I saw to my amazement that my bully couldn't swim. And he was in the deep end. Clinging to the wall.

I swam over and taunted him from the middle of the pool treading water. He grew angrier and angrier and eventually decided to lunge at me. That's when I pounced, holding his head under water. The years of torturing and bullying coming out of me. I was a far superior swimmer, there was nothing he could do. Kids started screaming. The class teacher chaperone on the trip saw it and jumped in, clothes and all, trying to get me off of him. I gave the teacher a tug as if to say ""I can take both of you if you want, you never stopped him from bullying me..."" but I let go.

First of all, I don't tolerate people's mean attitudes anymore, if they act mean, rude, and if they disrespect me for no reason (and not in a funny way), I cut them out, I don't need that toxicity in my life. Also, I am very kind to all people I meet because I feel like I dont know what they are going through so I rather be kind. I feel like I analyze people when I meet them to see if they actually are enjoying to spend time with me or of they are just doing it to be nice. Also I have identified the vibes of the people I usually get along with and I generally hang out with them. I am introverted but friendly girl, I mostly avoid spending time with ultra extroverts who party every week, I feel like I would seem too boring for them, or idk. I am sure most people who experienced bullying has adquiered certain attitudes or views."

Later I saw them approach my direction and I was a bit timid so I tried to avoid them but I could hear them laughing at me and making fun of my height loudly saying “omg look how short she is”! I quickly ran out to my parents car and cried. I felt like all the hard work and therapy to help me build a thicker skin had been ruined.

But I'm still bitter.

I'd like to point out that just because a girl bullied me, doesn't mean I'm a weak boy. Girls can bully boys as well.

But anyways. These bullies look like the sweetest girls in the whole classroom, but they have a dark side. Well, there isn't much of a ""light"" side, except when they're talking with their friends and stuff. Double personality uh?

Well, these girls have been harassing my friends and me lately. I insulted them and it just provoked them into harassing me more. I won't take any more of it.

From what I've observed, these girls are narcissistic. They believe themselves to be perfect, that women are perfect human beings, and that men are inherently inferior and that all of them are sex-hungry jerks. Practical feminazis. 

Because they're women, they think that no one can talk back or defend against them. That's why they act kind of surprised when someone actually talks back to them.

They also threaten others physically, challenging them practically. It's not like they don't know how to fight anyways. They throw haymakers, and thankfully I learned a self defense technique against it on YouTube and while I do not know martial arts, I'm planning on doing so soon and I already know some of the basics (stance, punches, grappling...). So if I were to fight, I'd probably just hit and run to the nearest authority figure. 

But they'd probably still try to harass me.

One solution I like to think of is by showing them that I'm not scared of them. To destroy their one source of ego. I could sack their ""leader"", use a martial arts technique to humiliate her in front of everybody.

Iust talking wouldn't do. In order for me to scare them off or just prevent them from hurting my friends, I'd need to show them that I am not afraid of them and to unveil the insecurities of their leader. Basically doing what I call ""malicious empathy"". To tell them basically:

 You're deep down a weak, sensitive girl who likes to bully others for her weak and fragile ego. I hope you fix those issues soon, and I also hope you realize that bullying is not the proper way to solve problems and let out your frustrations, and that men deserve as much respect as women.

I'd like to hear your advice."

All happened in a late September night in my city centre.
I was enjoying my time with two friends of mine, who I'll call S. and G. . 

We were chatting inside a night bar, sipping our favourite cocktails in a very relaxed ambience, when the time to pay the bill has come. 

They told me to pay with my credit card for everyone in a kidding manner, so I didn't take It seriously, since I knew they were just fooling around. 

So, I went to the counter and paid with a specific app to use as a voucher to get free drinks. 

Appearently, they expected me to pay with my credit card for real, because they just ran out of their vouchers a couple of days before and they had no intenction to pay with their cash. I felt a little sorry for It, but they could have told me in a more serious way about their ""economic situation"", so I would have paid for them without any problem. 

Anyway, we eventually released the little tension between us and the barman as G. paid with his cash. 

Once we bounced outta the bar, S. strongly pushed me on a wall while staring at me with his eyes wide open while firmly grabbing me by my shirt collar. 

They started to shout at me, blaming me to be an egoistical, hypocritical piece of sh*t. 

I did my best to stand up for myself as I raised my voice and told them to keep their cool and calm their a**es down, but maybe that was not my smartest decision as they suddenly began to shoving me again, this time even more abruptly, until G. convinced S. to let me go away. 

So I just walked off without looking back in a strange mix of disappointment, panic , anger and confusion.
Unfortunately through, as I almost made my way to the taxi rank, I felt my arm being grasped by someone: It was S. and I couldn't believe he just crossed the 400 meters long square running like a sprinter just to keep on that twisted fun he was having with the other guy.

They dragged me back to the point we were before then they picked me up and thrown me on the ground twice. I somehow managed to protect my head but still hit my bottom really hard. 

After that, they kept dragging me as some people were looking: they justified themselves telling them that I was high on psychodrugs and they were taking me home: to my disbelief the passersby actually believed them! 

Then we finally arrived to our bus stop but before catching it they dipped my head in the cold, dirty water of a drinking fountain to humiliate me.

After 10 minutes (more or less) our bus was about to come and that was the last ride of the day. I spent the last minutes of my night out waiting for the bus sitting on a pile of trash bags with bruises and aches everywhere. 

They were even planning to trap me on the bus and take me to their stop (the terminus, far away from my house), but I was able to escape and get home. 

They were the closest friends I had."

Years ago, my daughter was in a competition at school.  Although a mistake she made during the meet caused her team to lose points, the team won third place. When my daughter's name was called during the awards presentation, a teenager in the audience booed her by name. Right in the middle of the ceremony, I lept up and RAN to the kid, who was sitting between his two parents (effectively stopping the program). 

I knelt down, looked him squarely in the eye and said, ""Don't you DARE disrespect my daughter."" Then I GLARED at him, then at each parent. After I saw them all visibly squirm, I went back to my seat, and the ceremony went on. Not a soul said one word to me that night, or ever after. 

She is forty now. I asked her if she remembered that night.  She has a very clear recollection of the occasion. She said my reaction turned a very painful moment of parental-sanctioned bullying into the innate knowledge that if neither parents nor authorities would back her up, her single-parent mother ALWAYS would."

I often feel like just ending it all. Its just no point in anything anymore. I get bullied in school so much. It\`s every single day no matter where I go it's always there, even online. I\`ve deleted my Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. Simply because I was getting so much harassment. And if that sounded bad. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet. The f\*cking school hallways. It's a hell on earth, I get shouted at, pushed, grabbed, teased, even hit. They call me ""s\*ut"" ""wh\*re"" ""bi\*ch"" ""ugly"" ""fat"" ""disgusting"" and much more. Really everything you could think of. I\`m scared to go to school because I don't know whats going to happen.

Sometimes I go to the library to try and relax a little during lunch breaks. They once ripped my phone out of my hand and said that they were going to smash it. They didn't, but still.

Back when I was 13, I had just switched schools because of bullying. I was trying to start a new life. Everything was going fine. I was dating one of the boys. We were together for about a month until it all went to shit and it has been there to haunt me ever since. I'm 14, almost 15 now. That dickhead guy is now together with one of the other girls. I think that relationship is what really started the firestorm. I

it's usually a group of 3 girls and 2 guys. Everyone can see everything that is happening and they don't do anything. It makes me feel so helpless. They will take any opportunity to take what I say out of context and turn it against me. They will fabricate false stories and spread fake rumors just to make me look bad. They say that I\`m really close to my brother, like REALLY close. Wich, I am not. I love my brother, as a f\*cking brother. And that I have a crush on this one 17-year-old guy, who I bearly even know. I don't understand why they do this to me, I'm not a mean person in any way, actually I'm probably one of the nicest people you'd meet.

There is absolutely no fun in anything anymore. Everything is just an endless struggle. There is no escape from it. I am legally forced to go to school and I cant do anything about it. People think there is so much getting done to prevent it and yes there is a large amount of anti-bullying campaigns, but all they do is make people more aware of the issue, the bullies don't give a sh\*t and they are the once who are the real problem. My parents don't understand and the teachers just overlook it. When I get home from school, I just go to sleep immediately because all I do is cry. Sleeping is the only sort of escape I have. I have switched schools once and there are no other high schools in my area. I'm never going back to that school. I want to end it all. I cant take this anymore. The ONLY reason I havent done it yet is because I dont want to inflict that kind of greif and emotional pain on my family members. Notice how I didnt mention friends, you can probably guess why.

My profile picture is my face, btw. I know I'm ugly, I got that through my head years ago.

This is coming from a bullied victim himself who used it and had felt much better about themselves.
I used to be picked on by a few bullies in school one time, then eventually I had enough and snapped out of nowhere, hitting one of them in the face so many times that his skull cracked open and his face was covered in bruises. I didn't feel bad though, he had it coming since all he had done was make jokes about my deceased father and continued to stir up problems in the class. After I had beaten him up and kicked his ass so hard, I didn't feel bad at all. I felt so proud of myself that literally he stopped picking on me and causing problems right after he got suspended. I realized that deep down inside, violence could actually solve problems, It had solved my bullying problem that I was facing."

It was a very strict military institution and i had to clear an entrance test to get in. I had been motivated by my parents who told me the quality facilities and benefits the school had, i wasn't forced but they motivated me to join this school.

Here i was a 11 year old boy with dreams to achieve something good in life. I never knew the things that would follow would result in the most traumatic experience of my life. It was a boys only school and I stayed in one of the hostels. At first i began to note how some of the boys began to behave differently to me and i had no idea why. Like it was weird at first and i ignored it but as it continued i asked one of the only friends i had what was going on.

He said to me "" It is because you look a little like a girl"". At this point i should've just quit that school but no... i was determined nothing was gonna happen. What followed was sexual harassment, i wasn't raped but i was constantly grabbed on, beaten up, mocked and stolen from. If this happened to a normal school boy he had his parents but i had no one. Most days i cried myself to sleep alone. The few friends i had began to distance themselves from me. This school was a trap because i got into it with a scholarship, however if a person was to dropout before graduating 12th grade then all the scholarship had to be paid back to the school. I never told my parents because the school had taught me that men never complained. 

The bullying continued till 8th grade which by the end of it i thought people would finally stop bullying me because i looked different by now. Wrong again. The sexual harassment stopped but they continued to rob me of everything. They stole my watch, my clothes, my money. Even simple things like toothbrush and toothpaste are valuable here because i couldn't buy another one unless my parents visited. 

I always shared anything i had with anyone who needed it. My father used to bring snacks when he visited. These people used to steal them from my locked bag and placed a piece of paper with cuss words. This continued till 11th grade, but the damage was done. I no longer had any self confidence, i used to feel emasculated almost all the time, i could no longer trust anyone and have severe anxiety and depression. Suicidal thoughts flooded my brain.... After all this i made an effort to move on. I met a girl and we were in a relationship for a year. Finally something good in my life but no.. the insecurities i had continued to bother me and i felt she would cheat on me one day so i broke up with her.

I'm in a better place now but these memories continue to haunt me. I just wanted an outlet. After 10 years i finally have one."

In middle school and early high school I was bullied for being type 1 diabetic and in turn I became very self conscious of it during school hours. It became so bad that I stopped checking my blood sugar and taking insulin during school hours. This got so bad that my health took a dive.

I’m now in my fifth year of college, (hopefully going back EVENTUALLY) and I recently watched A Silent Voice and I absolutely broke down so many times during the movie. I usually don’t cry in movies because I repress my emotions because of my anxiety but watching that film I just lost control and cried hysterically (honestly felt great) 

Ever since I watched that film I am really trying to become comfortable with my emotions and I’ve started to accept the trauma that was inflicted on me. 

I really recommend to anyone who struggles with accepting the harm of the past to watch this film."

Of course they make fun of my looks but what’s the point?  Like everyone already thinks your beautiful why do you feel the need to put another girl’s looks down? It makes you look insecure. These girls obviously thought they were above me when it came to attractiveness but I have come to a realization that just because you are popular and told your beautiful by your peers ( aka other popular kids who are properly your friends) doesn’t mean the whole world views you as beautiful. Also there is always going to be someone more attractive than you no matter if they are popular or not. For me if some has a good personality and is nice I view them as more attractive than someone is physically more attractive. What I’m getting at is don’t believe what this bullies tell you. Half the time it isn’t true because I doubt they even know you as individual. Don’t let the opinions of strangers fool you into believing something you are not.
124,A story of name shame - When your name is Hannah Montana growing up in the time of Hannah Montana,16,hzs1sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hzs1sm/a_story_of_name_shame_when_your_name_is_hannah/,6,1596017162.0,"I want to tell you a story about a friend of mine.  She got bullied just because of her name.  What do I mean?  read below.

Note to mods that I am posting this with the blessings of the sobject, who's name is given as without it the story I will recount won't make sense at all.  She doesn't have a redit account and she gave me her full blessings to share this with this subredit.

So here it is:

In the UK, there was a girl named Hannah Montana Tyler.  Big deal, right?

Well, not if you are going to middle school around 2007-2011.  Being born in 1997 means that Hannah would have been in middle school during the craze known as Hannah Montana, a disney show starring Miley Cyrus as the titular character of Hannah Montana, a pseudonym of a girl named Miley Stuart.  All fine and dandy.

However, because there was another person in Hannah's school named Hannah Tyler (as that first and surname combo is somewhat common in the UK), they had to find a way to differentiate the two HT's.  So they used their middle initial I.E. Hannah M Tyler and Hannah G Tyler (I made up the second one because I don't know what the other HT's middle name was and even if I did I won't say.)

So you can imagine in September 2007 when my friend Hannah had her full name read in the first day of school's orientation classroom how students reacted when they heard ""Hannah Montana Tyler.""  Yes, laughter.  Hannah said she shrugged it off and that she actually liked the show Hannah Montana a little bit.  However, come the middle of the year, that's when the bullying began.

It started off with minor teasing, but it then escalated as the years went on.  By 2009, the bullying got physical as the bullies began to physically abuse her while making references to Hannah Montana.  Hannah had a decent singing voice, but she preferred UK garage music over teen pop music, yet the bullies used her love of singing to add fuel to their bullying fire, despite Hannah's taste in music being vastly different than the Disney character's tastes.

Without going into too much details as to not reveal too much more about her outside of what is relevant, she had been beaten up, and all of this was because she happened to have a name similar enough to a popular Disney show character.  She ended up in the hospital multiple times, and she suffered great mental abuse.  

Some times teens can be absolutely cruel, no matter the gender or what side of the pond they came from.  

Even in later years of high school the bullying continued even after the Hannah Montana craze died in the UK, but by then Hannah began to become numb to it all.  

The only real time she had a break from the bullying was when she was at home, with her friends or when she was on an exchange student program in Ethiopia.  She often says that her time in Ethiopia helped her in healing from all the bullying, and when she returned to the UK, she was happier.

Now, she doesn't like Hannah Montana the show and associates Miley Cyrus with the bullying she faced, though she holds nothing against Disney or Miley Cyrus.

&#x200B;

Why do I bring this up?  Because I'd like to know what it is that would possess school-age children to make a child's life a living hell just because she happens to share a name with something involving a trend of the time?

Do you know anybody who shares a name with a famous person and gets bullied for it?

How did they deal with it?  

What is your advice for people like Hannah who face bullying over something like their name?

I know we'd all love to hear your thoughts.

thanks.

PS, she's alright now and lives a much happier life with a job she loves."
125,My middle school bully is dead.,15,ho7fh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ho7fh6/my_middle_school_bully_is_dead/,8,1594345009.0,"In grade 7 I became the new girl in a Catholic middle school. Most students had been classmates since Kindergarten. I was not catholic, spoke no English but somehow managed to make friends in no time. I was extroverted and confident, worked hard and my grades were on the 90 percentile. 

During my first year, I also caught the eye of one of my class boys. He was smart and good at sports. He said he liked me and I said I liked him too. One day after a soccer game he gave me a peck on the cheek and that was my social death sentence.

Unknown to me, the Soccer Boy (SB) had been ""dating"" a girl from another class, she was a Teacher's Pet (TP), she would carry the teacher's books from one classroom to another. TP was super popular and supposed to be a good student, she was always surrounded by many girls, but her closest group was a pair of tween sisters (M&M).  For the rest of the school year, TP convinced every girl in her close group that I was undesirable, that my hair was ugly and that I was stupid for not speaking fluent English. TP would stare at me during recess and made sure I saw how she would point at me while whispering o her friend's ear. Many girls started rolling her eyes at me as soon as they would see me. The worst was that M&M, who were big scary girls would cut me off in the hallway and would threaten to hurt me if they ever saw me alone.

SB virtually disappeared after the one kiss, so he virtually had no part to play on the entire Middle School nightmare. The school was supposed to be super strict discipline wise. We wore a uniform and walked in perfectly orderly lines. However, this closely knitted group of bully girls managed to destroy my self-confidence to the point that I begged my parents to leave the School. I did talk to my homeroom teacher once, but she totally dismissed me and I felt even worse after not getting any help. TP was too well known for being the little miss perfect, so I was left on my own. I talked to my parents, they just told me to work it out with the girl. 

At the end of my first year there, my parent offered me to try for another year and if I kept 90 percentile grades I would be allowed to shift schools later. During my second year, I became more withdrawn but found comfort on a small group of girlfriends. I also became friends with some of the ""bad boys"".  I was still afraid of M&M and the girls would still make fun of me at every chance they got.

I did get an invitation to a birthday party. I'm pretty sure I only got the invite because the entire class was invited. I had seen this girl pointing fingers at me before but I was academically helping her with some classes, so I put on my nicest clothes and to the party, I went. I was super happy,  partying with my bad-boy friends and sharing the news that I was no goit back for senior year. When I hugged the bday girl and wished her a happy birthday she asked if it was true that I was leaving and I radiantly said yes. Then, the prettiest girl in the school told me that she knew the reason. She took almost one hour of her bday celebration to tell me how TP had rallied with every girl to outcast me. In summary, she validated me by confirming that the bullying was very real and I was no making the bullying up. I left the prestigious Catholic School, I enrolled in Public School and pretty much cut contact with most of my former classmates. 

More than 30 years after I found on BF a group for my former Catholic School class. I joined the group and was very happy to get reacquainted with my former classmates.  My bad-boy friends were there and welcomed me with open arms. SB was there and to my surprise, almost all of class remembered me.  Then the scariest one of the M&M pair posted a picture of TP and a grandiloquent eulogy about her BFF and how much she missed her and how tragic her death had been years before.  

Most of the members of FB group post about their great time in middle school. To me, those 2 years were like drowning underwater, but I still feel sorry for TP's life was cut short."
126,"He bullied me because I didn't like him back? or... Help me understand, please.",17,hnydnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hnydnb/he_bullied_me_because_i_didnt_like_him_back_or/,8,1594306106.0,"I went through a lot on my teenage years (psychological abuse, dealing with depression and anxiety disorder, dealing with my mother figure passing away, etc) and it taught me a lot.

Now, at 22 years old, I can look back at it without shedding a single tear and being proud of myself because of what I went through, but I've always wanted to tell this story because it's been a while and I'm still confused about it.

This all happened when I was 15 to 18 years old, btw.

The school I went to was small, for 700 people at most, but since the owner of the school sucked he had managed to fit inside this very small place around 1200 students which meant you basically knew everything that happened to everybody.

So, when I was 14 a bunch of new people came to my school and amongst these new people there was this guy: Tall, pale, blue eyed and brown haired guy ""F"" (not his real name).

F became popular quickly and a friend of mine liked him so she told me to please add him on Facebook so I could get to know him and then introduce him to her because she was too shy to do so and I accepted.

One day, there was this random celebration in my school where we all reunited around the field, and I had a crush on this guy (not F) who just so happened to be sitting on the same bleachers as him, so I was looking at that direction a lot and apparently, F thought I was looking at him so because his friends went to ask me about my name and stuff after the event was over, they also waited for me, that same day, so we could leave together after school which I ignored (F's group of friends were almost 10 guys so imagine 10 dudes waiting for you, intimidating).

Anyways, I ended up talking to F through fb a few weeks later and he said he knew who I was and that if I saw him around again I should greet him. We kept on talking with no romantic interest from my part, I am not sure about him,  and my friend (the one who liked F) got a boyfriend so I guess she wasn't interested in him anymore.

Me and F talked from May to October and he constantly asked if I liked somebody to which I, naively answered ""yes"" and I even told him the name of the guy I liked, sometimes he'd tell me that this guy would threaten him for talking to me and stuff which I never knew if it was real but he did say that.

During this time, F did some weird stuff besides the cringy, teenage flirting, when I was on my way to school he'd wait for the bus very close to my house which would be normal if he actually lived close to me but he didn't, he lives 40 minutes away from my house.

I'm not sure if he did this on purpose (which would be quiet extreme I mean we had classes at 8:15, we had to wake up EARLY) but I do think so considering that after we stopped talking I never saw him at that bus stop again.

Nothing really happened between us during those months except for one time he went to see me to my classroom and all my classmates saw him and started teasing me about my ""new boyfriend"". By the end of October I think F noticed I wasn't interested in him so he decided to date one of my classmates and that's when stuff got bad.

I started noticing how this girl who he was dating started hating me out of nowhere and when they broke up, a month later, he'd go back to talking to me so I cut him off and that was the last time we ever spoke.

The next year another girl came to my class and we were friends briefly, he saw me with her and the next day this girl tells me F had sent her a FB message saying he ""wanted to talk to her"" and so he did, two weeks later and they were dating.

Because of other shady situations not related to F this girl and I stopped being friends, she suddenly started hating me and this is when the real bullying started, I remember him and his group of friends mocking me, I also found out after that they'd kick my bag when I was there hoping to break my stuff, his girlfriend talking behind my back calling me a delusional liar and crazy for some reason I don't know, making fun of my depression and anxiety and when I was 17 I couldn't hold it anymore and I told my mom and my teachers and we started looking for a solution.

My school decided to do a ""mediation"" which basically worked like this; one person and me in a room with two teachers, we couldn't talk directly to each other and had to talk to the teacher as if we were talking to each other, it was strange but I took it anyways.

F was nowhere to be seen and since his girlfriend (my ex friend) was the most aggressive one of the two when it came to bullying me, I decided to talk to her. The teacher had to literally drag her by the arm into the room so we could talk.

F's girlfriend faked a panic attack, a heart attack and having heart problems to see if she could leave but they didn't let her, thankfully the teachers didn't believe her. 

During our mediation I really tried to ask her for the reason they had to hate me and all she did was cry, it wasn't until at the end of the conversation, that almost lasted 3 hours, (basically me and the teachers talking and me telling my bullying story)  when I said ""if this is some weird jealousy thing here you can see the texts your boyfriend used to send me, you can see he's the one flirting not me""

and all she said was ""I know already, F told me the truth yesterday"", after that they made her sign a document that basically said that if the bullying continued from any of the parts they'd be expelled and when we left the room my boyfriend and friends were waiting for me and they all told me ""F"" had basically disappeared looking really nervous and desperate.

The teasing stopped, the bullying stopped but I still got no explanation of anything, especially since most of the bullying was done behind my back.

Why do you guys think F did all this? "

I have recently begun to study in order to get a driver’s license. I have found out that one of my old bullies from elementary school also takes this year’s classes. 

We are all older than 18, and I haven’t seen her in 7 years. Yet, like the childish goose she is, she wants to resume what she left. She now has two other girls always sticking to her side.

Today they ‘greeted’ me in a mocking tone in class, saying “Hello Haaaaarvey.” and nothing else, then taking a seat away from me. I obviously did not answer.

My parents insist that I should answer back, but I think ignoring them is more mature. What should I do?"

Me and T were in the same highschool, we were classmates for the first year. For some reason he had a strong dislike towards me and there was no reason why. He was very cocky and liked to make fun of people. He would repeatedly call me Shrek everytime he saw me, even refer to me as Shrek to the teachers. One day, someone in our class painted his chair blue (probably because he ticked them off) and immediately accused me for it, even though I never even had the courage to stand up for myself when he did so many other things to me. 

His attitude started to become better the second year, when he became Student Body Council for the junior division. God, everyone looked up to him as if he were so holy. But I put our differences aside and accepted that maybe he was just trying to be a better person. 

In the last year of highschool, both of us and another 2 people were chosen to represent the school in an innovation contest. All of us had to work with aerogels, but we were divided into 2 groups. Lets just call it my team and T's team. So T's team wanted to make a supercapacitor using silicon aerogel and my team decided to make a water filtration system using a type of carbon aerogel. The professor that we were working with  explained to my team that T's project simply could not be done using silicon so he decised for us both to use carbon aerogel (my teams material) instead. I was completely okay with this at first, it made the 4 of us seem like more of a team. Apparently, he didnt think likewise.

We had some complication with our project so we abandoned it halfway, but my team had already made the carbon aerogels in the lab. So all of our hard work ended up being used my T's team. So he continued his project and won first place in the national innovation competition and continued on to represent our country in Phoenix, Arizona. I was obviously very proud of him because he made the group effort worthwhile. We ended up okay towards the end of school and all 4 of us ended up becoming Student Body Council members. His attutide was way better then, and he was rational for once in his life.

Fast forward to January of this year. Me and T both enrolled in the same college and to my surprise he became my classmate. I was mildly discomforted but I would say it was bad. We had a college innovation challenge and of course he would join using the aerogel project. But the thing is, when he talked to my friend about his project he insisted that the did the project alone, from the very start saying things like 'I like to work alone' and 'I did this project on my own'. This made my blood boil, and at the very time where I thought he'd finally change' And I got very emotional about it.

I vocalised about the issue on twitter, mocking him 'yeah go tell evedyone you did the project on your own'. Because, well, I was very hurt. He quote retweeted my tweet saying how I was always jealous of him because I wasn't good enough to do the project myself. And the thing about T is he loves to manipulate. He told his friends about how I was a very bad person and was always conceited to him even in high school, none of his words were true. But who was I to counter his statement? No one would believe me. The tweet gained traction and so many people were supporting him, telling him that I was rude and only jealous of his success. 

So I became the bigger person and called him that night to address the issue. We ended the call on good terms but the fact that he ruined my reputation spoke louder than the apologies he gave me, he didnt even bother to  re-explain to his followers on twitter about the misunderstanding so everyone still saw me as the bad guy. I cried all night, I dont know why but my whole brain was on fire my body was hurting physically for no reason, it just hurt so bad and I wanted everything to just stop. It was so bad that the wholr time I was thinking 'I'm on the top floor of the building, if I just jump everything would end' but I stopped myself and managed to go to sleep. 

The next morning I woke up with very bad migraines and vomiting that progressed for a whole week, for that whole week I did not go to classes. I went to a specialist to be diagnosed. She just said my sickness was triggered by something, and I knew exactly what it was. In the few days I was at the hospital, T came by to visit. There was no warning, he did not even ask permission and he was definitely the last person I wanted to see. The whole time he was there he kept telling me 'Ah why do I choose to acknowledge you' while laughing, like it was supposed to be a joke??? Um it wasnt funny????? Literally the whole time he was there, he continued to say things like that making me feel like I wasnt worth acknowledging????? All I could think was 'Then why did you visit me??????' He made me feel as if I was useless. So I treated him coldly after that, because it hurt me a lot when he said things like that especially in my own ward. 

Its almost July now and T's friends constantly keep harassing me online. The guys in my year in college dont talk to me or bat an eye at me anymore because of what he did, what he said to them, even when we were fine having long conversations before. 

I feel like giving up my course and applying to a new college now. All of these things have made me lose my sense of living, and its draining me by the second. Im so lost on what to do. I just want all the harassment to end. I just want everything to end :("

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't tolerate it. this group of people has always been toxic to me, and for absolutely no reason. I never did anything to them. I'm not the one to fight back, I've never been, which makes me an easy target. it's not only the picture edits too but it's just they always talk down on me, and I mean always. what should I do? any advice/comfort would be nice right now. thank you"
130,It's time to share my story. (Long),16,gw630e,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gw630e/its_time_to_share_my_story_long/,6,1591258068.0,"I'm actually 27 now. I'm a really extrovert person, always meeting new people.

That's why when I say I was heavily bullied on school, people don't believe me.


I've never told my full experience, and I feel that now on this chaotic times is the perfect time to do everything you always wanted to do but got too scared to do it.
And for me, is sharing my bullying experience.

I always went to the same school since kindergarten. My classmates and I know eachother since we were 5. And even though I thought we'll always be 'friends forever' it changed for me when I got to fourth grade.
I got to one of my classmates (very close friend at that moment) house to play with dolls and all of that. 
She got some new pets: hamsters
Showed them to me and we were really having a good time and all.
The next week she came to school crying that his smaller hamster died and blamed me for that: it was because I touched it, and because of that, the others hamsers didn't recognize it and it died of starvation.

Keep in mind, we were 9 years old. I'm not sure what happened to the poor lil guy, and I felt really guilty and sorry because I really thought it was my fault.
Now I know it was a child's thing, and that my classmate didn't know how to cope with loss and death, and needed someone to blame.

Even though that should've been a 'small' thing, it was the start of my nightmare.

I was isolated, insulted by all my 'friends', and even sometimes physically assaulted.


I was in a private school, but my family barely could pay for my education. They were trying their best to give me all the opportunities they never had, and I'll always be grateful for that.
But that didn't stop my classmates to bully me too for being poor and shame me that I couldn't even buy food on the cafeteria.
They also stole from me every new thing that my parents got for me with all their effort.

When new classmates arrived to our group, they were informed that I was a nobody, that being with me was equal to having all the class against them, and that they should treat me as they treated me.

So... I spent 5 years hiding on break time, and trying to do my best to be unnoticeable, to avoid physical and psychological assault.

I remember I was 11 and one morning I just... couldn't get up. I woke up wondering why I was still alive, why didin't I die while I was sleeping?

Depression hit really hard, and sadly never left me.
Also, all of my grades went down and never got better. Group work was equal to an F to me, because no one would want to work with me.

In case you're wondering, my parents never knew all of this until I finished school.
My young self was terrified that if I told them and changed schools, it would be worse.

So I had no friends at all on those 5 years, and if I didin't commit suicide it was because of books, games, and online forums.

BLESS that online forums, they saved my life.

1 year later I met another outcast that was bullied like me and things started to get a little better. I still was bullied in the worst ways ever but at least I had SOMEONE to share how I felt. 

Later that year my parents met some new neighbors that had too a daughter of my age.
She ended up being my best friend, it's been 10 years and our bond is stronger than everything.

I also started to learn Japanese (was a big fan of anime and the culture and still am) and there I met my other best friend.

And for the first time I felt like a normal child.

I started to have more self esteem and for the first time ever I didin't hide or cry, I started to stand my ground.

I feel like I did it unconsciously but I failed that year, so I had to repeat it with a new group of classmates.

And THAT was the best thing that happened in my life. 
At first I was afraid they would be worse that my other classmates. But after some time they accepted me and I was one more of them. I couldn't believe it! It was the best last 3 years of school, I was the happiest person

In that 3 years one of my bullies actually talked to me and said that she was really sorry for making all that things to me. She was the only one that said sorry. I really hope she's having a good life.
Right now I have the most amazing friends, the best hubby in the world, and a job that I'm happy to go every day (well not now, coronavirus lmao).


I guess this is 'The End', but we all know it isn't.
That almost 6 years of bullying changed me completely. Some things are good and some are bad. And even though when I think that I finally got over this experience, something in my life triggers it, and I feel like that helpless and confused 9 year old all over again.

I found out that therapy and family/friends support works wonders for overcoming this.

And one final word of advice: if you're being bullied, don't be like the 9 year old me. SEEK HELP.
Even if you think no one will support or help you, that you see no escape from this situation I can tell you that IT GETS BETTER. Tell your loved ones, or seek help from authorities if necessary but don't. stay. quiet.

You're a wonderful person and you deserve to be loved. 

You deserve the best this world can give."

At the same time I was viciously abused at home. I hot sadistic beatings from my stepfather related to my grades. ""I'm gonna beat yo ass for every minus on yo report card boy."" he said. I still can't believe I'm alive.

Do you think its possible that the stress associated with school and me blocking out my teacher effected my learning? I had trouble doing basic things. By the end of 6th grade I was totally lost in school. 

I know this is a seperate problem but do you think its possible to relearn stuff I forgot? Is it possible to go back and learn stuff I didn't understand back then? I'm 36 now."
132,My bulling experience in highschool,14,gdzpfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gdzpfv/my_bulling_experience_in_highschool/,7,1588720932.0,"I met this girl in elementary lets call her Ragnorok, Rag for short, you’ll see why later. We where friends, good friends, or at least so I though. She would always take stuff from me and other people and hid stuff in the girls bathroom, since we where dudes, we couldn’t go in and retrieve said things, so we’d tell teachers/

But thats not even the worst of it. The day she got snapchat, we played truth or dare. And she dared me to do the biggest mistake of my life. She said “Take a picture of yourself in your moms swimsuit” me being stupid I was like “OK, but don’t take a screen shot” She promised she wouldn’t but she did. I wasn’t too hesitant to do it because she seemed honest, that and I like to do crossplay occasionally so I didn’t mind. She had a picture of me in my moms black floral one piece. I felt horrified. She started spreading it.

I started to get text to me with the picture saying WTF. And I started freaking out. She showed everyone. Everyone. I insisted it was a Hawaiian wresting uniform, but then she showed it to wrelers and they said it wasn’t. So I had to make fake leg holes, and take a picture but everyone saw through my phasod. Some people stood up for me though. 

Some kids came up to me like. “Wanna see my girlfriend?” And showed me the pic.” Lots of dudes had the photo which makes me question wearther or not they had alternatice methods. Someone told me by the end of my freashmen year “it’s spreading like the corona virus. Some of my teachers saw. Some of my friendships where ended do to it. I was the laughing stock of my class.

As the years went by, Rag wouldn’t stop showing people. She would do it behind my back or infront of me, hide her phone and show everyone else. There where times I tried to take her phone an delete the pucture but she always yelled “RAPE!!!”

One day she told me her sexuality. I didn’t really care what she was tbh lol. And when she was throwing around the photo one day, I threatened to out her, looking back thats kinda a dick move on my part. But she played the victim card and said she wouldn’t do it again. BUT SHE LIED

Other things she would do is slap me on my chest and head and said since she was a girl it’d be harassment. She would even play my old embarrassing cringey youtube videos in my class

I couldn’t escape her, she was on my bus and in my classes, until senior year. I didn’t have a class with her and my buddy got his drivers license. Every other day I would drive to school with my friend. But still felt Rag’s wrath every other day and outside of school.

They last 2 weeks of school she seemed to change, and we became cool, until over the summer she snapped me a vid of her watching my old youtube videos and telling her friends mom about the window I broke like 8 years ago at their house, thats a story for another day.

I haven’t talked with her since, we have more that a 1k day streak on snapchat. It feels good getting this all out. I felt powerless against her and I wanted to leave but I couldn’t there where multiple times she even threatened putting the picture up on her insta and twitter which had descent followings, if I didn’t share her political views (I’m independent and sorta Libertarian leaning and I stand my my views) I was Harassed and Harassed and Harassed. And didn’t know what to do

What would you do if you where in shoes?"

Then I became depressed and now I strive to be emotionless sine I am tired of people dancing on top of my sensitivity. Most men suggest that you should kick or punch your bully but that only makes the situation worse so do not pretend to be some sort of know it all or an expert at my experiences since that is what usually happens on quora. Plus boys are bigger and stronger. I just want to be left alone since I am an introvert and love the silence. I was painfully shy as a child in middle school and in high school I was anxious. Sometimes i encounter jerks on the street. If suicide is not the answer then why do i attract bad people while classmates my age already had tons of good memories, friends and boyfriends. I feel shitty for being so low since bullying was what i was most afraid of . But focus is not my main stregrg neither is communication.

135,Two years later and I'm still scared of my high school bully. How do I move past this?,16,g1b8pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/g1b8pi/two_years_later_and_im_still_scared_of_my_high/,4,1586918603.0,"Hi,

In high school, somebody that I considered a very close friend grew hostile when I said no to a date. He started messaging me anonymously, berating me, and doing the same to my friends. He spread vicious rumors about me, and made people that I didn't even know absolutely hate me. He threatened to kill me multiple times, and last year I had to report him to the authorities and IC3 for cyberstalking.

I talk big, act like the thought of him doesn't bother me anymore, but it really, really does. Since high school, I've seen him twice. Once, in December while I was at my favorite store doing Christmas shopping. I'd forgotten that he worked there, and when I saw him I all but dove behind the nearest display, terrified of him seeing me. For the rest of the day, all I could think about was high school. It was as if I was right back in the guidance counselor's office being told that I wasn't being bullied and that it was all my fault anyways. I couldn't escape.

The second time was a few days ago. I was walking out of a store as he was walking in. I saw him, and I know that he saw me too. I looked down, and just walked straight ahead back to my car. I was shaking for hours, and I've been flashing back to memories from high school ever since.

As long as I am afraid of him, he has control over me. I do not want him to have control over me.

When this whole pandemic is over, I plan on meeting with my therapist to develop coping mechanisms for this, but what can I do in the meantime? I have to do something - this fear has to stop. It's been two years."

So has anyone come across someone who acted like a bully but insisted they were helping?  I have run into this twice with very different results.

The first time I wasn't the target, I was at a job core a place where people between the ages of 16 and 24 go to get their diploma / GED and learn a job trade.  The kid I'm talking about in this one was 17, he was a bit skittish and a little awkward.  Because of this, a small group of people started to be hard on him.  They weren't being really mean just calling him out when he had a hard time and being overly critical. By them it really looked like this kid couldn't do anything right.  I ended up talking to him and found it was a cycle of; he would make a mistake, they would mess with him about it, then he would become self-conscious and screw up again then rinse and repeat.  Now I understood what was up so I talked to one of the guys from the group and asked him why they were being so harsh.  He told me it was because they liked him and were trying to toughen him up.  I had to call him out on it, I told him that it just wasn't a good way to do things.  He told me that was how he was raised so I told him that was you, not him.  I also explained how they were just making things harder for him.  After a little more talk he decided he would talk to the rest of the guys.  Later on, in trade class, I saw them chilling out pretty friendly.  I asked the kid after the fact and he said they were being more friendly and that things were getting easier.  I was pretty happy with the result and I think this is a case of misunderstanding.

So onto the second and to a very different result.

I was in the army but I won't lie, I wasn't made for the military life.  During boot it was rough, it is expected.  No one breezes through boot and if they tell you they did then there are full of it.  In this case, I knew this one guy in boot who insisted he was being helpful, we will call him highspeed. He and a couple of others were very condescending and very immature.  They were the classic machismo types and being the opposite they targeted me.  Thing was that they insisted they wanted to help, the problem was that the methods they used were very ineffective or just plain messed up.  A good example was how they didn't like that I dried shaved.  They saw it as a front to their sense apparently and insisted I do things their way.  To fix this the solution highspeed came up with was to insist I shave with some disposable cheap razor instead of the Mach5 I was using at the time.  I refused and of course, things kept rolling on.  They would find something, usually, something minor an elevates it to ""we gotta fix it"" statues and poke at me relentlessly.  It all came down to a head during the last event for boot.  Every company gets to gather each with a FOB like set up.  One night he insisted on talking to me.  He told me that he was using his skills to help and mentor me but that I keep resisting.  That one day I would understand and come to thank him.  I really saw it as a really condescending thing to say but I also noticed that he really was under the assumption that he would help me.   After that, I came up with the phrase, ""trying to help with a two-ton sledge.""  No matter what he said though to justify it, it was still bullying and I know the others just took advantage to get their rocks off. 

It's really weird to have someone bully you because they thought somehow its a helpful method.

How about you out there, anyone run into this odd situation and how did you handle it."

I did it through facebook as the chances of me meeting him again face to face are slim. And then I blockd him before he could reply to me. Not out of fear, but out disgust of people like him and all my christian bullies that prasied GOD in one hand, and tormenented with me with the other.

I needed to vent.

\_\_\_

Just found this subreddit and felt like sharing a story. I was bullied grades 1-6, and was severly unpopular grades 6-9 because I was a bit overweight and loved video games. Grades 4-6 were the worst. I still remember the feeling of hopelessness that was so prevalent during those years. And just like in every school, the teachers barely did anything. The times my parents would call the school because I refused to go due to bullying they'd talk to the entire class and say that u/SPUGG0 IS BULLIED BECAUSE HE IS OVERWEIGHT AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE MEAN TO HIM SO STOP IT, clap their hands, say ""fixed it"" and move on. There were several kids that would gang up on me or take turns bullying me. One of them was a thin, short kid that liked slapping me a little bit enough times that when my fuse ran out and I got angry it'd always be in a space where a teacher saw me get mad, and thus I would get the blame. ""Well, he is overreacting"" they'd tell my parents.

Some 12 years later I'm in uni and have taken a year off studying due to getting a job working as a marketing manager, a pretty high-status position due to there being so few of them and, as a marketing/PR student, it gives managerial experience at an early point in life. I am organizing tons of events which need student volunteers, and a girl I work with promises to bring a few people from her class. She sends in the names, and there he was. His last name is pretty different so there was no mistaking, but that sort of blast from the past took me by surprise. I go to where I know they're prepping and look for him, but end up running into the girl I know and we talk a bit, until I hear behind me:

\_\_\_

THE GOOD PART

""Are you u/spugg0 from <location>?""

I look behind me and there he was. Still the same face, the same wafer thin body, but it's twelve years later and we're both in our early 20s. Apparently he's studying biology.

But there was nothing. No anger, no resentment, no sadness. It was just a face. 

I said yes, told him ""It's been a while"" with a surprisingly happy voice, and gave him a hug. It was like twelve years later there had been so much water under the bridge that even though he was part of the reason several years of my life was hell, I didn't want to spend any energy hating him.

&#x200B;

Later, at a party I told the girl I work with that he was one of my childhood bullies. She started crying laughing from the shock, and told me ""he's hit on every single girl in my friend group. They all think he's a bit weird"". And maybe that is the redemption I got. But it didn't matter. Because he didn't matter to me. I'd grown past it.

We all had a really good time, I only know her and her family and as far as I can tell, they all like me and always say how lovely I am. But anyway, my friend invited her friends, obviously as you do. They were really nice and kind and I got on with all of them...except one. I had no issue with her, but for some reason, everything I said or did, she would just make snide remarks and just be bitchy for no reason. Like???? I asked her how old she was and she told me she was 25. 

That’s cool, but like, when does the bitchiness end??? What’s so wrong about just being a nice person? I didn’t let it bother me much because I just thought, she must be jealous in some way to have a bitchy comment to say after everything I say or do but it confuses me so much. Idk why she would be jealous, I’m not really a special person, she was taller skinnier and probably prettier in my opinion, not that that shit matters to me. 

But why do girls act like this? She’s nearly 30 years old and still acting like a pathetic teenager in school who only cares about popularity, she ruined my night if I’m honest and I’m now just not wanting to go to my friends again but I know it’s not her fault she wasn’t even there when it happened. I’m just really ticked off now because this girl turned what was a really good night into a shit show. Disappointing, really. I would have brought it up if it wasn’t my mates birthday, and I also thought I’m probably not gonna see this girl again. But here I am, writing a paragraph about how she made me feel. 

I feel stupid for even posting about it, it doesn’t happen a lot but now and then, I feel like I must be an easy target maybe because I’m just nice? I’d like to come across as intimidating sometimes just so people won’t mess with me. But that’s not me, it’s not my nature, I don’t see why I should be targeted for being nice. But now I’m just considering pretending to be something I’m not when I go out so people will think twice about being nasty. Don’t really know why I’m posting this just had to rant. Hate people."

150,Is this bullying? Or am I a baby?,16,hb9tw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hb9tw2/is_this_bullying_or_am_i_a_baby/,7,1592493197.0,So I have ptsd from emotion and physical abuse. I’m a bit sensitive and people making fun of me or calling me names triggers me so hard. I end up having an entire breakdown if I hear someone (mostly boys in school) called me ugly  or someone tells me I can’t sit in a desk cause they don’t want me near them. Anyways this one boy and his group of friends repeatedly yell my name. This has gone off and on for the last two years. I know it’s not a big deal but the fact they come to my work to do it or do it in any class I’m in really gets to me. I know I should just try an ignore it but I can’t focus on my work when I’m holding back tears. I want to express that I’m a pretty normal kid. I’m not the smelly kid in school who no one wants to be by. I’m just quiet and stuff but for some reason most of the boys in my grade (sophomore going on junior) target me. All this stuff has made me suffer in the self confidence department. I’m terrified of what people think of me and whether I’m up to their standers. I don’t even go into stores a lot anymore because I’m scared of seeing someone I know and they’ll laugh at me. I’m wondering if the specific situation with the boys is bullying? I’m also wondering if it would seem babish if I emailed my principal explaining the situation including my mental health and having him talk to them and asking them to please leave me alone.
151,Bullied and Humiliated in College,15,hahd6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hahd6r/bullied_and_humiliated_in_college/,10,1592386330.0," 

I  go to a small community college. All my professors keep telling me drop  out of my community college program,( Accounting). They think I cant do  math with out a calculator. I was supposed to subtract something in  front of the class, i blanked out. but i know how to subtract and  multiply without a calculator. Also I wrote February 30 instead of 28 on  my quiz. When I scared I blank out even If i know the answer.

They  keeping degrading me in front of my class, and everyone notices. My  professor told me to drop out of the program in front of the entire  class, and it spread to most of the people in the program. During my  exam (the exam took place in a hall with 1st and 2nd year students) my  teacher tried break my calculator, by trying to pull it a part. Also my  professor stood so her back side faced me, she also threw the sign in  sheet at me. I feel so humiliated. (There is more they did, but I dont  want to write it)

none of my class  mates like me. I feel horrible about my self. I get okay marks, I am 75  to 85 student. I literally getting bullied by my classmates and  teachers.  I made zero friends, my crush looked at me in disgust. Due to  the Coronavirus, i might complete college without going to college  (Thank god). Also the college is near by me, so I see some of the people  from college near me neighborhood. Few people even tried to hit me.

I want to die,  I feel so humiliated. I can't drop out of my program because I don't have a job and my mom is single parent."

I'm 44. Was bullied intensely as a kid. started in 1st grade and got worse and worse every year, even after changing schools in 5th grade. Had kids pull down my pants in class and teachers laugh, had my food taken every lunch period, was labeled the school f\*\*\*\*\* (I'm straight too, BTW) and only had one other friend in school who, like me, was also viciously teased. I was a straight A student until 10th grade when I had my first mental breakdown and ""checked out"". My grades plummeted and I retreated to playing video games and trying to find enough alone time to recharge the batteries that the weekly punishment I endured at school took out of me.  It was why after I graduated I never went to college, since several of my bullies told me they'd follow me there and I was afraid it would continue. 

I started working full-time after high-school at 18 and sadly, even had two bullies at work. I endured that, and when they quit my job, they were replaced by other bullies. One was the store's truck driver who hated non-blacks and would humiliate and taunt me (I'm white) and the Hispanic workers in our department. I fled that job after a breakdown and bounced from job to job, getting bullied by co-workers and fleeing those jobs to go to others. Spent two years in isolation never leaving the house and only started working again after my grandmother died and I was at risk of being homeless.

That was in 2008 and I once again was bullied in the next job, with my bully even stalking me off the clock and waiting for me at the mall entrance where he pushed me into traffic and threatened my life all because he, quote, ""said I was talking \*\*\*\* about him"" (I wasn't, I never talked to anyone about anything, ever).

Bounced around to a couple other jobs, but now, instead of being bullied, I found I had become violent and unhinged due to all the abuse. Now I was losing jobs because I was flying into a rage whenever someone ""tested"" me. I lost one job after attacking a customer, another I had to walk out after going on a tirade and cursing out every customer in my line and smashing my fist through a register.

Around this time I met a girl through an online site and we fell in love. I lived with her and she helped me through college. Had a 3.95 GPA and excelled. Got a good job at her company. Then, about a year into that, my wife started bullying me. She said how I was a loser because I didn't try for a better position. (I was happy doing what I was doing and had friendly co-workers in my department, which meant more to me than money) She called me a coward, said I was a ""woman"", and not man enough for her. She started hitting me. I would often pretend to be asleep after she came home, but she once came into bed and started punching me in my side. After 2 years of her physical and mental abuse, I walked out on her and rebuilt my life thanks to the job I had and an understanding parent.

Sadly, because she got me that job, she conspired to get me fired and turned my boss against me. My boss began to openly harass me in front of my co-workers. My co-workers told me to stand up to him. I told HR. HR said he was a contracted employee who didn't work for them and was an outside staff member so they had little power over it. After a few months of him belittling me, I got into a fight with him and they called the cops. Almost got arrested but he dropped charges and they banned me from the building.

That was 2 and a half years ago. I'm in another job now and my bosses adore my work ethic and my co-workers don't bother with me, mainly because I'm now so nasty and angry that they stand away from me and don't talk to me. Which I suppose is good because it has certainly deterred any bullying.

The problem? I can't walk outside. Can't socialize. Besides going out to pay bills or grocery shop, I don't leave my apartment on days off. I also regularly punch the walls and smash things at work when people from other departments yell at me or insult me, which happens with a certain department that already hates the department I work for.

I have no friends because I don't trust myself around others, since if people crack jokes about me or ""Test me"", I will probably go violent on them. Same with family. 

There are people here who are experiencing pain. I hope it doesn't continue into your adult life. For me, it did. It seems to never end. The stink of being a victim stays with you, and bullies can smell it."
154,My friends bullying experience in elementary school.,16,ej82wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ej82wl/my_friends_bullying_experience_in_elementary/,3,1578044440.0,"This isn't a personal experience of mine as I never was really bullied in life.But I always made sure to protect those who were.

Anyway,I met this man  through a mutual friend about 2 years ago and we clicked almost instantly and have been friends ever since. 

He's 27 now,married to a loving wife and has 2 kids and they live in the Eureka California area

I'm going to write this down as best as I can as he explained it to me

He was born and  lived in the Tujunga area of Los Angeles California until he was in the 5th grade

He was pretty popular among his peers in school while living there,he was a good athlete and an even better student.

He came from a higher middle class family and they lived in a nice home in L.A.He always had lots of buddies to hang out with too

All of the girls also had crushes on him (his words haha) But that all changed when his dad was transferred to a new city for his job.

His friends from L.A kept in touch with him for awhile on MySpace but they all soon quit speaking to him (he still doesn't know why to this day""

My friend didn't really want to move away ,but he was confident that he would easily make new friends due to his athleticism and nice behavior .

How wrong he was...

They moved to Mammoth Lakes California(a popular ski resort city) and he was quickly enrolled in school there.

He loved the beauty of the forest trees that surrounded the area and the amazing lake.

He looked forward to exploring the surrounding area once he made new friends.

However,within  the first hour or so of his first time stepping into the school-8th grade graduation,his school life became a living hell.

Apparenly,the most popular boy in his new class took an immediate dislike for my friend and made it his goal to make my friend miserable 

Everyday my friend was taunted,a victim of false rumors (mainly being accused of being gay),slapped,shoved around,spit balled etc

He was outcasted from any school and after school activities by his fellow school mates.

The teachers were no help either.He claims that the teachers would litterly ignore the bullies taunts directed at him nearly every time.

One teacher apparently purposely embarrassed him in front of the entire class when he called his dad to come pick him up because he was sick.

She had his dad come into the classroom when he arrived to pick up my friend to inform his dad (and his classmates) that he was a failing student

His grades were plummeting as his time living there went on due to the cinstsnt harassment and bullying 

One time in the 8th grade (his final year there) a girl he had a crush on asked him to a school dance

He was so excited and his mom bought him a great tuxedo for the occasion.But when he arrived to the dance...

His ""date"" poured drinks all over his suit before laughing with her friends and walking away.

There are more stories about his horrible time there but it would take me days to finish it all.So that's all for now

He and his family moved to central CA when he graugated 8th grade and his life began to get better again

He made new friends and got back into sports and had a few girlfriends as well

Bit of backstory, my brother (13yo) is autistic, on the lower end of the spectrum, and has high anxiety. Due to the autism, he has some bathroom problems; he will sometimes soil (not wet) himself, and then his anxiety can prevent him from doing anything about it right away. He never had an issue at the school he was at for K-4th grade, but as soon as he moved to his current school, which is 5-12 he started having issues with bullying. Last year he spent about 2½ weeks in the hospital due to an infection in his leg, and that mixed with some of his grades, our parents requested that he be kept back a grade (6th grade). He's done much better in that sense, having made it through 6th grade and doing amazingly in 7th grade now. However, the issue with bullying has cropped up again, where even today he was getting comments to wipe his butt, or that he should get shampoo for Christmas.

I'm just trying to see if anyone can give me some advice on where to go from here. Our parents have already met with the school repeatedly with obviously no results. He has been set up with an outside counselor to talk to which we ended when he told us the counselor told him to tell the kids bullying him to ""eff off,"" and the last thing we want is for him to start lashing out at them.

This also isn't a normal public school. It is a charter school (you get in either through a lottery system, or you're guaranteed in if you have a sibling currently enrolled, which I was graduating from 12th grade when my parents applied for him.) The point being, it's a charter school not part of the normal public school system for my city, and I am alumni at the school. 

Sorry this has all been such a mess, I'm typing this up on my phone at work because he texted me while he was at lunch and I just want to try to help, so any help is appreciated."

I was able to tag some people who bullied me while I attended middle school.

One girl replied and said she was deeply sorry for what she did. I told her that her apology would’ve actually meant something if I didn’t have to solicit it over three decades later. She agreed.

We chatted on Messenger after that, and I informed her what I went through growing up in a violent home.

She told me that she was now a Christian and had to apologize to others over the years for things she did when she was younger. She admitted to being a bully and feels remorse.

I’m a guy, so she didn’t actually bully me in the traditional sense, but she was mean to me.

One incident that has tormented me all these years was a time when I got to the bus late after school ended. By the time I got on, the only seat available was hers, and she absolutely refused to let me sit next to her. I can still remember how disgusted she looked at me. There were probably 35-50 people on the bus, and I felt so humiliated. I kept pleading with her to allow me to sit, but she wouldn’t move over. The bus started to move and the bus driver finally ordered her to let me sit. She grudgingly moved over with an even more disgusted look on her face. She was let off first, and stormed off in a huff.

I hope this will give me closure for at least one of my demons."

And because I had to run and I was sweating like crazy and in the heated room, my wound was infected and I had to treat it again. Which was a literal pain in my ass. It also ruined my hopes that I might have not been able to go on a trip to London. Thankfully the wound healed before my trip to London, but ripped open and was infected on the day I arrived in London. It's shut now, still getting sometimes infected but otherwise it's okay besides stinging when I sit. Thanks for reading!"

So I don't know the *full* story here.... but what I do know is that one of my sister's students had an incident in which he basically ""Just logged off"". Did it cause the cyberbullying to stop?

Quite the contrary - apparently, his family disconnected their landline due to all the phone calls they received. He deleted his facebook, didn't have a twitter or an Instagram, probably locked down his phone and internet usage to avoid it. 

Well guess what - eventually someone gave a tip to the police that this guy (the student) ""confessed"" to rape, made violent threats and all sorts of other provocative and suggestive comments via Facebook and the like. And my sister was allegedly one of the people he ""Raped"". (btw she's not a student - she's a *teacher*.) 

Well the perps were never caught - they were able to prove that these texts were spoofed and the facebook account was faked using a yearbook picture. But not the perpetrators.

Yeah, this kid was lucky. Think of all the people who actually end up going to court or have their reputations permanently tarnished. (Even if it's proven you're innocent, there'll still be people going around whispering ""S/he is 100% guilty."" behind your back and it'll reach people.) Or who had to move because of which, which ends up vindicating the ""They're guilty"" crowd. 

Yeah, ""just log off"" and ""Just block them"". It 100% works... provided your harassers aren't interested in actually causing damage. It doesn't do a damn thing."

I had met her and her husband years ago when I had a conference at school with the bully, my parents, and his parents.

I wasn't surprised by this because this wasn't the first or the last time I'd get harassed by someone.

Anyway, for simplicity, I will call this woman ""Mrs. Smith"" here. So Mrs. Smith is like ""/u/1010101212, I remember you from years ago."" I suck at confrontation, so I just kind of shrugged, and felt uncomfortable. Mrs. Smith goes on, ""You're a little monster for trying to get my son expelled. Fuck you."" I was like, ""I didn't try to get him expelled..."" So Mrs. Smith just shot back with a ""fuck you, bitch."" This was happening in the aisle of a Walgreens, for the record. I walked away, feeling victimized again. I've been humiliated publically many times, including in recent times, but this was particularly awful. 

I feel like a magnet for bullies and awful people. I keep running into these sort of people, they get off on embarrassing me and making me feel like garbage.

Holy shit. THANK YOU FOR CARING. I didn’t think a single person would ever read this.

Sorry for the long title. And sorry if the story jumps around a lot, I’ve never told anyone outside of the people involved and my only close friend I have left. So for the sake of this story and because I don’t really feel safe, we’ll call my childhood bully “S” and her husband “A”.

I grew up with S from the time I was 4 years old. For the record I just turned 30 so S and I had/have a very long history that I won’t recap all of. I met S in preschool and we were fast friends. She barely spoke any English because she came here from another country and I was the shy kid from a newly divorced home. We hit it off. We went to the library, played at her house, and sat next to each other every day in school. She’s in nearly every picture of me from preschool because we were inseparable. Our moms became close friends too. It’s important to this story to know S’s parents are still happily married to this day. She didn’t and never did understand the “broken home” thing. Her family was wealthy, mine were poverty line. For a very long time that didn’t matter.

I didn’t really understand what S was doing from around 1st grade to 3rd grade but as an adult who has had much therapy I now I understand that the tactic she used to hurt me was Gaslighting. She convinced me time and time again that I was being crazy or that the other kids didn’t like me because of me, while she was busy behind the scenes poisoning them against me. In truth and again credited to a lot of therapy as an adult, being quiet, poor, small, and learning disabled didn’t make me crazy, just a lonely little kid who wanted friends. But that’s what abusers, even tiny ones in instrument playing, house with a pool having packages do.

The bulk of what really destroyed me as a person happened in 3rd grade. S turned openly evil toward me. She no longer hid her hatred for me or that she didn’t want me around. The thing is, she would flip flop on whether she hated me weekly, so I would be overjoyed she wanted to be friends again and for a week or so I wouldn’t be alone at lunch because she and her newfound army of rich kid friends allowed me to sit with them or play with them on the playground.

This became a problem. Because every time she would “take me back” I would drop any nice kid who gave me the time of day to sit with her. This cost me several very decent, lovely kids who probably would’ve wanted to play with me if I didn’t ditch them every time S came calling. I was 9, I just didn’t want to be alone. I regret ditching the two or three potential friends I could’ve made back then. I still live with hurting their feelings for S. At 30 I still feel like a bad person for ditching kids who probably just needed a friend too. S had me so brainwashed I simply didn’t know better.

By the middle of 3rd grade I was acting out and receiving Pink Slips for my “behavior”. This “behavior” was S telling on me for things she did and didn’t want to get caught doing. By this time S had a new sidekick, let’s call her “R”. R did any and everything S commanded her to do. This included stealing food from my backpack (I was a sickly kid who had to eat every couple hours for blood sugar), among other things such as pencils, CD singles (this was 1998) and Lip Smackers. I would have to constantly make up excuses to get things from my backpack to check if S and R had rummaged through my stuff and taken whatever looked interesting. I specifically remember a sleeve of cookies and a pencil my grandfather gave me going missing. S used the pencil a few days later claiming her mom bought it for her at Office Depot when I asked her to give it back; I knew it was mine because the eraser was messed up (my grandfather worked in a workshop type place and all his fun stuff was a little used/well loved).

S did other things like invite me to her birthday party where she and R wore matching swimsuits and paraded around arm in arm while I sat inside alone, too embarrassed to call my mom and tell her they tricked me (I didn’t even know it was a pool party).

When R’s parents got divorced S’s mom called my mom and informed her that S would be cancelling our plans (during a week she liked me) to “be with R as she’s very upset right now” (R’s father walked out on the family). This is the same child who made fun of me, stole from me, and accused me of all kinds of horrible things just because I was a poor kid from a divorced family. But suddenly it was tragic when R went through it. R was rich, and as an adult I understand an opportunist when I see one. Back then it was just confusing as shit.

After R’s parents got divorced she turned as evil as S. Up until that point she was just an annoying and slightly stupid sidekick. The kid wasn’t really smart enough to mastermind her own bullying tactics so she went along with S.

By the end of 3rd grade I kind of snapped. There were two incidents I recall specifically now: R was following me for no reason and somehow ended up throwing a pen or something onto the school’s flat landing over a railing. R wasn’t smart as I said. She was the kind of kid who would break something just to see if it could be broken, then cry because it broke. So she flicked the pen or whatever it was over the railing and then realized “well shit now I can’t get it back”.

I walked away from R but I turned around for a minute, pointed to the railing and said “go get it”.

She went home and told her mother I told her to kill herself. *I’m autistic but wasn’t yet diagnosed at 9 so my sense of humor and personality have always been VERY flat. Kids didn’t get it. “Go get it” was a joke but since my inflection didn’t intone it it was free range for R to get me sent to the principal.

The other incident was me throwing a dodge ball at her head. That was on purpose. No regrets there. Would not teach my future children to handle a bully this way but at the time it was the first I ever asserted myself.

This is getting too long: cut to 4th grade and my mom ensured S wasn’t in any of my classes. I was doing better. I got braces. I joined the school choir. I had a friend named “B”. I won the talent show doing Angelica Pickles cosplay (I never said I was cool okay!). I was still a pretty sickly, small, quiet kid but I was coming out of my shell. My mom had remarried a nice man and I had two step siblings at home one of which was an older brother so I felt protected. He didn’t let anyone mess with me. I felt tall. He was and still is awesome to this day.

5th grade was the same. I had several lovely teachers who encouraged me to keep writing stories. That’s what I did, I was always writing stories or doodling in notebooks. I made a career out of it as an adult but that was a long way off.

6th grade S was back on my radar and 3rd grade happened all over again. Except under the guise of S getting close with my family and I so no one would suspect her. She seemed to have changed her ways. She came to my 12th birthday party. Things got so bad after that I planned my suicide. My mom found and switched me to a new school. I thrived. I made so many friends I didn’t know what to do with myself. Without S whispering in people’s ears the kids liked me! I never had to sit alone at lunch and in fact kids sought me out to sit with me! My grades were perfect. I joined the drama club. I was in counseling for the divorce and for S. I wanted to live. My life was like this with the occasional teenage hiccup for the rest of the time I was in school.

I went to a technical college because I knew I wouldn’t survive college life. I couldn’t risk my stable mental health. I got a degree (I never used it, I became a writer). I made a life for myself. I escaped S. S’s sister let’s call her “Big S” went to the same tech school but we only overlapped for a couple of months. I graduated first. Big S was S’s family disappointment. I always liked her. She wasn’t a bad person. I even said hi to her a couple of times so as not to be rude when I saw her in the school hallways.

I never asked her about S. She wasn’t important to me anymore.

Cut to 2015. I receive a letter in the mail stating that S and her husband have filed a restraining order against me. I couldn’t breathe. I had a panic attack in front of my mailbox. As it turns out S filed it after receiving a letter I emailed her months prior. Many people in my life received them. I was in the process of making amends with those I hurt and who hurt me. She was just a number on a list of many amends I made. She was the only one who didn’t accept my words.

I took a loan from my mother for $1,500, hired a lawyer, and showed up to the court date. S’s husband informed my lawyer that S simply wanted to see if she could bulldoze me again all these years later. This was after my lawyer discovered dozens of attempts by S to break into my email, my Amazon account, my Instagram, etc. He had them on hand at the court date. They dropped the restraining order request then and there. It was in that moment S knew she fucked up. Or so I thought.

Cut to 2019 and I’m chronically ill with a pain condition that requires a lot of doctors. My lawyer in 2015 made S and her husband agree to stay away from me and never contact or come near me again. They were to stay away. That was easy because I lived an hour from the city they wrote down on the court docs.

I was wrong again. S took a job in my city. It’s a very tiny city. She lives in a very big one. She took a job 5 minutes from where I live in an office building I have to frequent for my doctors and imaging. I cannot change where I go when I depend on insurance to pay for it.

I have PTSD from a lifetime of abuse by S who I can’t seem to escape from. I have nightmares about her. I’m scared I’ll see her in my city or when I go to the doctor. I cry myself to sleep worrying she’ll accuse me of something or find me. I just want to get away from her and I don’t know what to do anymore.

Sorry for extreme length. I have no one to talk to besides my therapist and she doesn’t always help."

I've read studies that show if you were bullied as an adolescent you're more likely to be bullied as an adult. I guess I'm walking proof. 

I'm part of a theatre group and I basically just confirmed that a handful of people I thought were my friends have been saying very cruel things behind my back. I don't understand why people can't just be honest. Don't pretend to be my friend if you don't like me! What is so hard about that? Or if I did something that made you dislike me - tell me! No one communicates and when I try to bring things up people look at me like I have three heads and pretend like it's all in my head. 

This has happened so many times... at work, in other theaters, with friend groups... that I'm 100% sure there's something wrong with me. I try so hard, but maybe that's the problem. I feel truly defeated right now. When will this end? I don't want to die, but I don't want to live like this anymore. "

As life moves on, I live my life each day hating myself everyday. This is how i all started: Basically near the end of my junior year of high school, my friendship grew with the friends i made in my freshman year. One girl was Polish and the other was Arabic. They were friends before me as they went to the same middle school, high school and now possibly the same college as well. Long story short, we are no longer friends anymore as I found messages between them saying things behind my back. As payback for whatever reason they had in mind, they decided to send me something very offensive after our graduation in which they sent it anonymously on Instagram. To give context, “Fake Friends” i guess represents their saltiness on what a middle school friend of mines said about them when I told my middle school friend that Polish and Arabic Bitch were talking about me behind my back.

Since then, I’ve hated my life. Clearly, they were my only close friends and I blew it. Because of that, I am attending a college where no one from my high school chose. Everyone from high school chose the common community college and I am attending a university near home. To make matters worst, I am still cool with an asian friend but she lives in the same area, went to the same middle school as them, goes to the same community college as Polish bitch and catches a ride with her. Sadly, I sometimes see this on my asian friend’s snapchat story but i always avoid it as I don’t want to relive my nightmare since i’m basically “missing out” if that’s the right word. 

Not to mention, winter break has finally begun and I wanted to hang out with some people but of course they’re out doing they’re on thing with their friends. Looked out to my cousin (my auntie’s daughter) but she’s ALWAYS at our other cousin’s house (my uncle’s children). Not to mention, these are the same cousins who excluded me from going to Atlanta with them. they didn’t want to ask me because they assumed “i didn’t like traveling.” (end of the story, i was pissed but hurt)

I’m living in a household with a sexist and body-shaming dad and an OCD mother who thinks I should be dressing like some celebrity when everyone knows SWEATER/SWEATSHIRT AND JOGGING PANTS ARE LIFE. She also gently body shames me, my habits and “me not
looking my best.” 

As 2019 begins to arrive, I am looking at myself as a person now and how I hate every bit of me. there's something that i lack and i can't define what it is. i dont like my life to the point that i don’t know if I can take it anymore. I’m sorry if
my stories are not going in a straight line but i hope it summarizes on why i won’t be surprised if i kill myself for a new year’s resolution :)

169,Two of my most painful memories. (Trigger warning),14,ie1t6a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ie1t6a/two_of_my_most_painful_memories_trigger_warning/,6,1598061724.0,"I was 6. It was show and tell day and I wanted to bring my teddy bear my father gave me for his first Christmas with me. I was so excisted to show everyone this important piece of me. I loved this stuffed animal almost more then my dog. I had him hidden in my backpack. Ready to show him off. Show and tell came and went and no one cared about my teddy. I kept him out and continued on with my school day. But then the teacher left the room. 

All of a sudden my classmates started calling me out. ""Why'd you bring your teddy bear? What are you? A baby?"" 

""You're such a baby.""

""Your teddy bear is stupid""

Of course being 6 years old I started crying. Then that horrid name started. A name I couldn't escape for 9 nine years until I moved. 
""Crybaby. Crybaby.""

I crawled underneath my desk as if it could sheild me against the harsh words they threw at me. They never needed to touch me in my nine years of being the bullied kid. Because their words left deeper scars on me then any knife, cut, punch, or kick ever would. I laid there, underneath my desk. Hugging my teddy, crying my eyes out as I begged to be sent home to my Mom.

I begged for someone or something to swoop me up and take me home. To deliver me to the arms of my mom so she could comfort me. When the teacher came back, the kids were silent and I was still under the table. Sobbing. Begging to be put into the arms of my mother. 

My parents never found out. My teacher did nothing. The principal did nothing. 

From that day on, I sat alone on the swings. I didn't play with the other kids. I distanced myself from them and kept to myself. Only having two friends who I would lose when I moved schools for the second memory.

I had made friends with a neighbor of mine. I thought she was cool and all that fun stuff. It had been any other normal day. I tried to avoid going out to recess. Sat in the counselors room for most of it. Spent the rest next to the door outside.

When I returned to class the kids were whispering and looking at me. I could feel a pit forming at the bottom of my stomach. As the teacher left the room, I knew something was about to happen. My friend, one of few people who I thought would stay by my side betrayed me.

The name started again. I couldn't breath because of the tears I held back. 

Cry baby

Cry baby.

It still echoes in my ears to this day. And when the teacher finally returned. She got onto both of us. While I sobbing and this person stood there with a smug face. She punished both of us. She nevered contacted my parents or the principal. I was the one who had to tell my parents.


Years later. I'm in high school. I'm still bullied. I suffer from depression, social anxiety, ptsd, and paranoria. I still struggle to make friends. I keep to myself.

Do these people even realise the pain and suffering they put me through? The mental illneses they helped manifest? If they did, would they even be sorry?"

To put a long story short I'm 28 and male and know I'm straight. However since primary school, probably year 2 (6-7 years old), I was bullied horrifically for apparently being gay. During a brief period of my life, aka my first half of secondary school this stopped (12-14), but ever since it continued after I moved school.

I've had exes state they thought I was at least Gay/Bi when I first met them. In every workplace I have ever been in (and I've been in a fair few) it's always cropped up and I've often become the butt of homophobic bullying.

It's got to the point where I get incredibly defensive and then feel guilty about being defensive about my perceived homosexuality, despite there being nothing wrong with being gay. I have multiple friends in the LGBT+ community and when they talk about the discrimination in their lives I don't want to bring up my experiences because I don't feel they'd take me seriously as a straight guy being abused because of gay perceptions.

I'm just really starting to struggle with this and as I've got older it's started to affect me more and more. I honestly think people pick up my non-heteronormatic mannerisms and use it against me because they know I'm straight."

There is a large window that is too large for a single blind so there are two and the neighbors watch me through the gap between them and make comments on what I'm doing.

Now every time I go out in front of the building they call the name in an exaggerated manner and harrass me.

But now i’m in a new high school. I don’t have any friends despite efforts made and I am getting bullied again. and i know how bad it gets.

176,How a teacher sorted my bullying! :)),14,dvm7i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dvm7i9/how_a_teacher_sorted_my_bullying/,7,1573647186.0,"This is what COULD happen ideally if you tell a teacher. I was bullied by 13 people in 4 years, 6 at once and this is what I did. 

You tell the teacher, they should take it very seriously because there is a ‘zero tolerance for bullying’ at all schools. 

I’d suggest going with a parent/guardian for support.

Give them the names of the bullies. They will take notes and write what each one does summed up because sometimes people bully in different ways (I was bullied by different people who all had a different way of bullying me). 

Express your concerns about being called a ‘snitch’, getting in trouble for telling a teacher etc. They have worked in schools for years, they will understand. They won’t do anything yet.

Aim to have it appear to the bullies that OTHER PEOPLE reported the bullying and not the victim. Yes it’s a lie but it’s the best thing to do. I know with bystanders, it may be hard for the bully to believe that someone reported it. Everyone in the room may laugh along at the time, so the bully may think it could only have been the victim.

Teachers will hopefully keep a watchful eye (e.g. my photography teacher would tell my bully to go back to her seat when she approached me). A senior staff member like the Headteacher or Deputy Head can drag these kids into their office and have strict words and say “I know you are bullying (name).” 

Agree it with the headteacher that they can say to the bully “some students overheard you picking on her” or *”the teacher on duty saw.”* No one is going to question that. If the bully is being told off by a teacher who says “a teacher/a student saw...” the bully won’t question it, they just won’t, trust me. 

It will never be made out to be you guys reporting incidents, but of course it will be you guys; report bullying every time it happens. The same DAY so it’s fresh information so they can do something about it. Take note, get it reported. The teacher helping will go about it with discretion don’t worry. 

When your headteacher speaks to the bully they can say “If I hear that you spoke to (name) again you will be in trouble.” In my situation, our headteacher reassured me that “I’ve told him not to talk to you. If he bothers you again, you come and tell me and he’ll be straight back here getting told off again.” It made me feel relieved and safe that we had a plan and the teachers were amazing in helping.

The moment it happens, you report it in straight away (my mum and I used to write an email after school saying “in maths today..” etc), and they’re in the office again. It took a long time for my bullying to stop but it did eventually and it wouldn’t have stopped without this teacher shouting at the kids for me and being like “we do not have bullying in my school!” Bullying should be treated like a serious matter. I’m so sorry you’re being treated differently/horribly/unkindly/unfairly. I think you’re amazing and I hope everything improves soon (it will!!). 

Good luck :)"
177,My son may be bullying...,13,dsnsqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dsnsqw/my_son_may_be_bullying/,2,1573108098.0,"My son is in 2nd grade. I'm worried that he's been going down the path of being a bit of a bully and I'm worried that it will continue and worsen. Today a classmate's mother contacted us saying that my son has been picking on her boy sporadically over the past few weeks but especially today. Nothing physical but taunting, mocking, and other verbal attacks and that the boy has come home crying twice due to my sons words. 

It could be coincidence but it may be worth noting that much of this seems to have begun around the time the local school closed and my son started riding the public school bus. The parents seem to believe that this particular school bus transports the majority of the ""bad kids"" and my wife is convinced this has rubbed off on him and the abrasive behavior has become normalized for him. When he first started riding the bus I was very concerned that he would be the one bullied and there were several instances where that appeared to be the case (random bigger kid insulting him or hitting him). I even started looking into getting him involved in wrestling or karate to develop confidence and a basic ability to defend himself. Now, a year later, he seems to be taking up the mantle of aggressor and I'm concerned. 

&#x200B;

We have kids over to play with him often and I've noticed the manner that he treats his playmates also seems to be worsening; he's less patient, his teasing crosses into taunts more, anything they like that he doesn't is subject to mockery. Still nothing physical, just in general being kind of a jerk. 

&#x200B;

I've been watching videos and reading articles to prepare for action when I get home but I really want to get this right. I was bullied as a child and the marks it has left are still there. I guess I've looked at this from the bullied kids eyes for so long that my worries always centered around my kid being bullied - not the other way around. I feel unprepared and could use advice."

Since that incident I can hardly remember anything and I forget a lot. It was also not the first time that my head got literally smashed against a wall. I remember this boy, he was really aggressive and he bullied me, though I was in 3rd grade and he in the 1st grade. If you even touched him slightly he would beat the shit out of you, no matter if you were a girl or another boy. It was winter, we had lunch break outside, it was cold and everywhere was snow. I don't know why I tapped that boy's shoulder but I did for some reason. I ran away and to one of my classmates, standing next to the wall and we talked until I felt two hands on my head, brutally shoving my head hard against the wall. What I heard from the classmate was that I immediately blacked out and collapsed to the cold ground. She got some teachers and they just dragged me inside into the school like a trash bag. The teachers were supposed to call an ambulance because I was out for about one and an half hour. When I woke up, I saw my mom being furious, talking to the teachers that they should've called an ambulance and that she hopes the boy gets what he deserves for hurting me and other kids. The boy's grandma showed up and started screaming at him, she said he needs to buy me something with his pocket money as an apology. They left quickly though and my mom took me immediately to the hospital to check if everything is okay. I honestly can't remember the trip to the hospital, as said, I don't remember really anything after that incident.

181,Would this be considered bullying?,12,cwmbw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cwmbw7/would_this_be_considered_bullying/,12,1567034832.0,"I've tried to keep it short but it turned out to be so long. I'm sorry! 
Tldr; my high school ""friends"" asked me to hang out with them only to get the silent treatment. Would it be considered bullying?


Back when I was in high school, I used to get some weird treatment from my ""friends"", that even now I find confusing. 

I've always been shy, nerdy and not very popular. I totally didn't fit in that friend's group, because they were the ""cool"" kind of girls. But for some reason that is beyond my knowledge, they never kicked me out of the group. On the contrary, they invited me to hang out, which made me think they considered me part of the group even if I felt that I didn't belong there. The problem was that even though they invited me to hang out with them... They ignored me. Always. No matter what I did or said, it was ignored. Even when they acknowledged my existence, they treated me differently from the rest. A few examples I can remember are:

- When I gave my opinion, I was ignored, but then someone repeated the same words that I said and was highly praised for having good ideas.

- There was this one time I made a cake and they thought it was delicious, until they found out I made it. Then it suddenly became ""meh"". 

- There was one time when they invited me to a sleepover and not only I was the only one who got to sleep alone, but at some point one of the girls said ""there's people who don't belong in here"". Honestly, I couldn't agree more that I didn't belong there, but why did they invite me then??

- ""Surprise"" birthday parties became a trend. My parties and presents were always considerably worse. (Example: they always gave each other several presents and they were cool things. I was given a simple T-shirt and nothing else. One mere T-shirt was the present I got from 8 people).

I eventually cut ties with them when we started going to university (hanging out became more difficult, and I learned to say ""no""). I don't really care about all of that anymore, but it did really hurt me back in high school. 


So, would this be considered some sort of bullying? Has anything similar ever happened to anyone else? Why would they have such contradictory behaviour with me (invite me to hang out just to ignore my existence afterwards)?"

All the girls in my class call me and ugly skank or a slut and even scratched into my locker “go kill yourself slut” I’ve done literally nothing to them. I try to be as kind as I can to everyone! I told my old best friend about how my father was suffering from depression himself and fighting his own demons and she told the whole class. Everyone likes to tell me my father is going to kill himself but what they don’t know is my father DID pass away a couple of mouths ago. I’ve had no one to talk to, I’ve had nothing to do and my mother is broken. All the kids in the class tell me I’m worthless and that I should go kill myself. I’ve told adults and teachers but that made the bullying 10x worse. I really just want to have my friends back.  Or for the bullying to lesson to the point where I don’t have to be worried to go to school."

186,#JUSTICEFORAUDREY,14,bbvsyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bbvsyj/justiceforaudrey/,2,1554985260.0,"I'm speaking from Indonesia and currently, we have a problem that won't be solved without your contribution.

Currently there's an ongoing petition to serve justice for Audrey, a 14 years old victim of assault by 12 high school girls.

The petition:
https://www.change.org/p/kpai-official-dan-kpp-pa-segera-berikan-keadilan-untuk-audrey-justiceforaudrey

Audrey was brutally beaten; her head rammed to asphalt and her face beaten with heavy-duty footwear, causing her nose to bleed; there was trauma on her chest as well as on her stomach which caused internal bleeding.

And the worst part is, one perpetrator even stuck her finger in Audrey's private parts, ""to take away her virginity"", which resulted in swelling and horrific psychological trauma.

This happened in 29th of March 2019 in Pontianak, West Kalimantan. Audrey's parents didn't go to the police until 5th of April 2019 because Audrey was threatened that they will do worse things to her if she even spoke about this to her parents.

At the 5th of April there was an attempt for mediation, in which the perpetrators were just... giggling. Like it's all a big joke. At one point, there was a video of the three of them doing boomerangs in police office while being questioned.

The parents of these 12 disgusting girls are said to be important people of the society, one of them being a politician. The Commission of Child Protection (KPPAD), at one point, even stated that the case should end peacefully with no repercussions for the perpetrator.

Some of their schoolmates have since came out to say that these 12 girls are known to be delinquents. The smoke, they harrass, they do things that 'badass' kids do. And I feel like they know their parents have power, thus they don't fear the law.

This is real life. It's been a hot topic of discussion all over Indonesia. Influencers, a top-notch lawyer, and even regular people are fueling this conversation. What I fear the most is that this conversation will be muted by money and power in order to free these girls from lawful repercussions.

This isn't the first time a case like this was strangely closed without proper closure. A student of the University of Gajah Mada (UGM) was raped in a time of KKN (Corruption, Collusion and Nepotism). Indonesian netizens were crazy about this case, only for the case to be closed because 'both parties chose to make peace'.

Audrey's case was closed for a short time and then somehow reopened with a visum that stated that there was no trauma to Audrey's head and her hymen is still intact.

Then why, after she was taken to the hospital to be checked, she was rushed into intensive care?

Hymens don't always break upon contact with any object, but many Indonesians still don't know about this.

This visum suddenly split our netizens. Many are saying the sexual abuse didn't happen. Many are protecting these perpetrators, saying they don't deserve the harrassment by netizens.

My point is, we can't do this alone. As much as we want to trust the government, there are holes and doubts that haunt us. We need you to urge the government to do something about this. Maybe, international help can help Audrey get her closure.

Just.. maybe.

There's still so much to talk about. If possible, I'll make updates and more explanation on Audrey's case.

Please don't let this conversation die."
187,Some bullies assaulted me on the bus and destroyed some of my files,14,b8hq19,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b8hq19/some_bullies_assaulted_me_on_the_bus_and/,7,1554231580.0,"I was travelling on a public bus with a folder full of important files that I had to take to city hall.  I was sitting in the back of the bus and a group of my bullies were sitting further to the front.  When the bus reached my stop and I got up to leave, the bullies started shoving me around.  I dropped my folder with all its important papers on the floor.  In the scuffle I was shoved off the bus, without my files and I'm a bit screwed because some of those documents are irreplaceable.  The next day, the bullies just laughed off the incident.  I explained how badly they injured me but they just shrugged.

&#x200B;

These bullies are in my class, and I don't know how to get back at them.  If I report them to the teachers, I'm afraid they might do little or nothing.  The same goes for the police, since we're all under 18.  I was thinking of vandalizing some of my bullies' property, but that would make them angry and vindictive.  Should I pick a fistfight with them?  If I manage to beat them up, would that deter future abuse?  They say bullies are cowards but I haven't tested this personally.  I'm afraid of kicking off an escalating spiral of tit-for-tat, which I can ill afford because me and my family are in a delicate state of affairs currently (single mother who is sick)."

Some Redditors started making comments like ""if that's the way that you feel about him, then that's why he left"". They completely ignored the fact that I was sad and angry because he abused me.

Afterward, they made a spectacle after one suggested that they ""dig through my other posts to see how crazy (I am)"". They found a post about me feeling suicidal and rubbed it in my face with ""lol""s and ""see how crazy she is"", and ""that guy dodged a bullet"" and they filled the thread with more than 50 comments making fun of my suicidal tendencies, implying that I deserved my ex's abuse, and calling me ""crazy""... despite me telling them to stop. They even told me that my therapist must not be good enough ""because (I'm) still crazy"". When I started deleting comments and posts in preparation to shut down the account, the main leader then innocently posted ""Hello. Why are you deleting things?""

At that point, I knew that the bullying was deliberate. Reddit needs to do something to prevent things from going that far. A few months ago, when I was feeling suicidal, that would have pushed me over the edge. Fortunately, I'm stronger now and although it was depressing, I survived.

Reddit, fix this. The next person may not be as fortunate."
191,My bully became a successful person in life.,13,a6y80w,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/a6y80w/my_bully_became_a_successful_person_in_life/,7,1545066472.0,"I know I’m not supposed to feel angry about something that happened almost ten years ago, but after I got bullied in school at the ages of 11-13 my life really went down. I developed a couple of social mental disorders over the past few years and spent most of my teenager years completely alone. I’ve grown fat because finding sports that I enjoy has been difficult since they sucked every ounce of fun I had doing them, and I never had the courage to approach a girl I liked because one of my bullies became so after she learned I had a crush on her. All of those actions intensified by the constant mockery coming from a single boy in my classroom that is the reason I don’t enjoy sports anymore.

 He did everything in his power to put me down and for a time ruined my dreams. This kid is one of the major reasons why my past ten years have been nothing but loneliness with a few bright moments. I cut him off my life years after I last saw him when I was 15, after he posted many rude comments in some photos mocking me in much of the same way he did in the past.

I am 21 now and still recovering from that, managed to make friends again when I was 16 and it’s been a little better since then. Even started off a promising career as a painter and illustrator that’s still pretty modest but growing. But after a recent conversation with a friend that went through the same at that time I was curious to see how these other people were doing, and to my surprise, he is doing *REALLY* well. Dude has become a pretty successful underground musician, with a promising career as a male model and a possible acting role at the biggest television company in the country. He even became an activist for social justice, posting suicide hotlines for people to share if they see anybody that needs it. His profile now is almost unrecognisable from the person I knew and did everything that was in his power to put me through hell. 

I’m still fucking pissed off and angry about him, I hate his guts to bits and I don’t know what I’d do if I saw him in front of me again. And I also feel terrible that his incessant bullying succeeded in making me a miserable person while he enjoys life to its fullest blissfully unaware about what he did to me.

So, what should I do about this? Part of me wants to confront him in private and talk about everything he has done to me, but I also feel like this could become another opportunity for him to put me down, and I’d rather not talk to him anymore at all, but I still want to see this through, I want to put an end to all the suffering I endured for so long and move on, forgive them if I can but make up for my lost time. Is it worth it to jeopardise all my progress so far just so I get to hear an apology from him? Is it possible that he has truly changed and is not just virtue signalling this to get a clear conscience?"

There were these 2 teenagers who had accused 8 year old me of stepping on their headphones and breaking it.  All of which was untrue. However that was no excuse. 

The caretakers there didn’t really watch us.  These girls would pull me into a “sleeping room” for kids to relax or sleep in. And they would hit me, give me the Indian rug burn (twisting my skin to make it hurt) and accuse me of things I never did.   

Now I was a good and obedient kid. And these kids who were much older than me and bigger than would pick on me who was a small 7/8 year old boy.  

I never told anyone because they scared me by saying if I told the caretakers, they would start cutting my arm and stomach.  

And so in the carehome, there was like only 2 bathrooms.  It wasn’t a lot of bathrooms for a day care.  One told I wet my pants because I waited too soon and all bathrooms were locked.  I was given a pair to change into, however, the owner of the carehome told me to go with the girls to be helped in changing my clothes. Which again I was 8, I was old enough to get dressed by myself.  

So when I went to the bathroom, it was a typical house bathroom.  A bath tub, sink, toilet.  When I had changed I remember seeing them point at my private area and laughing at it.  When I had finished dressing, I was about to leave but like the second girl grabbed me and filled the bathtub up.   They then attempted to water board me in which the caretaker luckily intervened. The girls tried to lie by saying I was fighting because i didn’t want a bath.  

I can’t remember anything else. But like the girls bullied me, an 8 year old boy."

There are quite a few kids (i say kids, although they are 17/18, for good reason) in my class who i can only describe as bullies. They have many snide ways of bullying people so they are able to go unnoticed by teachers and subsequently get away with what they are doing. Im quite a level-headed person so i can control my temper and know when to say things and when not to but these kids have been testing my patience. One thing they do, which i have noticed because i have been a target of this, is asking people questions. Sounds simple but they ask questions when they don’t actually care for the answer. They use your answer against you, either to question your character, make inside jokes between themselves about you, or talk about it in their little group-chat. For example they might ask someone ‘why are you eating that for lunch’. Seems like a simple question to a teacher listening in to the conversation but that bully has only asked because they are making fun of what they are eating and will use the answer as a joke or maybe they know the person is self-conscience about eating in front of others or in the past they have mentioned how they feel judged when they eat. Their snide ways have kept them under the radar but I’m worried as most are wanting to become nurses and midwives etc, and i for one wouldn’t like someone like that treat me. Ive spoken to my tutors but as they do it so snidely and they argue their case so well, i’m sure nothing will happen to stop it."

Last week, I learned from a cousin that a bully who graduated with me ended up in the hospital over Thanksgiving break. The bully also tormented my cousin. In fact, the bully (a girl) liked to make the school her territory and even targeted those in the special needs classes. She was disciplined with detention and threats of expulsion, but she continued to bully everyone she didn't like. 

Anyway, my cousin learned through social media (perhaps through the grapevine too) that our tormentor was in the hospital. The reason remains unclear, but someone said that the bully will go to jail. It sounds like she committed drunk driving or broke the law in some way. Not sure if I should be concerned or relieved that she's getting the much needed punishment she deserved."

I have autism, so I've always tried to keep away from everyone to avoid giving people reasons to mock me and just did my own thing. In the last 3 years of school, there was this guy. He always did things like putting his leg in my path so I would trip, walking over to where I was to mock me, and simply just laugh of me being weird constantly. I don't know if the rest of the class liked him or not, my mind was too busy to check on that. Let's just say they thought he was cool. I know he has abusive parents, so that's kind of a reason why he'd be that way, but I don't feel pity for me.
Some of the worst days of my life yet were because of his fault. Sometimes I think I should've just hit him in the face. But I didn't because back then I was scared of him, I guess.
Now that I'm an adult I've been thinking that today I could stand up to him. So I've been thinking about finding where he lives, and do one of these. I could either just give him a beating and tell him he deserves it for all the pain he has caused me. Or I could try and talk to him and explain to him how much pain he has caused me and that I hate him for if. Because maybe he didn't realise he was hurting me. Though I doubt it. I don't know what to do. Still today I remember he things he used to do and I feel horrible. I know some of you have been through similar things and can give some advice. And I also know some of you will tell me that I have to move on, but it's not easy. I can't just forget, because it still hurts me today.

The head bully is a girl with a gap in her teeth, dark blond hair. She liked to call me all sorts of names and tell me how worthless I was. I found her a few weeks ago working in a grocery store. She recognizes me and asks how I have been doing. Tell her things are good and I ask her the same. She said she has two children, both with different fathers, but they both ditched her when she revealed her pregnancies. She has been working at the same store ever since high school. She can't take any time off because she needs money for her children's needs. I did feel bad. 

The second was a jock. Was on the football team, but he got arrested when he tested positive for steroids. Pretty much ruined his hopes of getting into the NFL. I heard from a close friend that he actually committed suicide by overdose. 

Two sisters who bullied me were denied scholarship of the colleges of their choice. It was discovered they liked to shoplift, but always got caught. They ended up not going to college because most of the ones they liked denied them entry. 

So I would like to ask: Does karma exist? What was your karma story?"
213,Bullying situations in a nutshell,14,d9vhro,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/d9vhro/bullying_situations_in_a_nutshell/,2,1569588365.0,"Bully: <Bullies victim>

Bystanders: *""Ah, don't worry about them. They're just playing around.""*

Victim: <Naturally, complains about it>

Bystanders: *""Why are you being so sensitive? They're just harmlessly teasing and you whine about it? Grow up.""*

Bully: Continues bullying victim (predictably)

Bystanders: *""It's okay, they're just hardcore.""*

Victim: <Snaps>

Bystanders: *""This behavior of yours is borderline unacceptable. We're calling the police.""*

&#x200B;

The dialogue above sums up how bullying situations are often handled, from my understanding.

The victim knew it was harassment, but for some strange reason, no one else thought so. And even though the victim explained, stating the stuff that differentiates playful teasing among friends and downright harassment to prove their point, the bystanders still didn't listen and continued to insist that there's absolutely nothing wrong with the bully's behavior and denied that the victim was, well, the victim. Every bystander the victim tried to consult instead blamed them.

As the bullying continues, the victim eventually reaches their limit and mentally snaps, yet all the bystanders still get appalled by it, not even addressing what caused such a reaction in the first place. That's the root of the problem: The bystanders probably knew it was bullying, but instead of at least calling the bully out on it, they just casually downplayed it.

Aftermath: The victim is labeled the bully (and possibly a menace to society), while the ACTUAL bully gets away with their bullying, all because the bystanders excused them.

218,3 years this happened... and it happened today again...,13,brr7h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/brr7h7/3_years_this_happened_and_it_happened_today_again/,3,1558573008.0,"In primary school, I was never really a social person.. I had one friend that would talk to me every so often but I was usually left alone which I didn't mind. Until year 2, in which a girl (I won't name her although I'd really love to) decided to randomly pick on me. It wasn't an every day thing so at first but progressively got worse and by the end of year 2 I was coming home and crying around half the time. I didn't actually confront her until year 5 (3 years later!). Despite this I had a good last year.

Then came Secondary School. Let's do a cast:
Me - me
AF - Awful Friend
F 1, 2, 3, 4 - Friend 1, 2, 3, 4
PK - Popular kids
MB - Main bully
TB - Tag-along bitch

Okay, so I was never really bothered by the PKs until this year, and moreso this term, a certain PK could not stop asking if I like him now. I did end up crying from his harassment at the end of a Maths lesson. (No, this was not just ""Do you like me now?"" It was pestering and making everyone look at me - which I could not hate more). But today I had enough of it, not to make me do anything bad but I have just had enough. So MB happens to be in my group for rounders in PE. (Great, wonderful, I am SO overjoyed). I'm in year 9 so I had just done a test and I'd got a 7 in it (which is a high B/low A, quite good) I was really happy so she starts talking about me behind my back like ""Oh I hate that girl, she told her mum I bullied her in primary school."" And her TB was like ""Yeah she was talking about it once, when you were sent out."" To which she replies ""Really?! What a bitch."" ANYWAYS, we're throwing a ball around as an exercise and she goes ""Oh OP, why aren't you throwing the ball to me? That's kinda rude."" (Bare in mind I'm desperately attempting to avoid her) I simply tell her to shut up so her and her TB decide to go ""I am so offended! We should get her kicked out the group. She's so rude!"" I shrug it off but am upset. So this goes on for a bit longer and she pesters me on and off for the rest of the lesson. Then MB FINALLY HAS TO GO CAUSE SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY HIT HER IN THE HEAD! I'm happy now, but her TB decides to take the spotlight for a bit, which I don't really care about. (I forgot to mention but I am a bit overweight and they had actually MOCKED ME walking like a monster going ""Stomp stomp stomp"" and laughing. This made me really annoyed and upset.) So anyway this TB is going like ""Ew"" and ""Why are you looking at me?? God don't be so rude!"" I don't mind her she's just annoying. Anyways, after her little show I see MB talking to a teacher acting upset and I can slightly see her mouthing utter bullshit that definitely did NOT happen during the lesson, and I am pretty sure she was talking about me. I'll see if I get called in tomorrow, wish me luck. I've dealt with enough shit from her.



Update: Nothing really happened today. I asked not to be in her group and was put in a group of people who also understood how much of a bitch she is. I think if she messes with me again, I'm going to punch her. I'm done with her shit.

Today we did rounders but she threw the ball weird for me and we ended up getting half a rounder because of it so it's a bonus. Thanks for the support. Xx"
219,I legit debated in my mind whether a 25 to life prison sentence was worth it,13,bc6yu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bc6yu4/i_legit_debated_in_my_mind_whether_a_25_to_life/,1,1555055705.0,"My bullies were horrible. This wasn't just bullying, these were fucking recidivist asshole felons I was dealing with. The lowest reprobates of society. I really hope they wound up in concollege later in life, because that's where these fucking degens belong. My bullies, are why prisons and jails exist, pretty much.

But there were times where like I'd deal with bullies and I'd be thinking ""Well, what I really wanna do to this guy, I'm gonna have to serve 25 to life when I'm done, which sucks. On the other hand, I get to choke the life out of this guy with my bare hands, and that's gonna rock. I am going to feel very good if this guy has his life and air snuffed out of him from my bare hands.

This guy wasn't the worst, not by any means. Frankly if you ask my opinion of him today, he became an upstanding man, and I have no qualms with him. I don't hold a grudge lightly, and that's why I don't hold a grudge against this guy, because he was by no means the worst, and frankly after this incident, he realized his actions were really shitty towards me, and he never treated me shitty again. He redeemed himself and even apologized, which is why I hold a high opinion of him now.

But like I went to my friends birthday party. And I was trying to be nice to everyone. But this guy came with a BAD mood. And it was specifically, because I was there. And they tell you like you know, if someone's picking on you, blow it off. You know just ignore them. So I did. He'd say some blatantly disrespectful shit to me in front of everyone, he's a big kid though. If I get in a fight with him, I'm getting my ass kicked, so there ain't shit I can do. So I kept blowing him off, ignoring him. I dunno about the others, but in a just world, he would have looked like a piece of shit to everyone else at that birthday party for how he's treating me. On the other hand, because he's a cruel piece of shit, that's specifically why some people liked him, it was like they looked up to him.

Party's goin, we're at a haunted horror house. I've blowed him off to this point, didn't say anything disrespectful back to him, and finally the motherfucker spits in my god damn fucking hair. And I was so pissed. But there's not fucking shit I can do, if I go to kick his ass, I get my ass kicked. I was so overwhelmed with anger, frustration, violation, disgust, I just fucking run off crying. Fuck this stupid fucking party. I am not putting up with someone spitting in my god damn fucking hair.

Apparently the other party goers had enough of his shit for once, and they got mad at him, and they went and retreived me, I was sitting by the car there's not shit to do, the party's fuckin' over from where I'm standing.

That was when I was a nerdy 14 year old, scrawny. But like one day, I'm drunk as fuck, and it just pops in my head decades after the fact. And I message on facebook, I'm now a grown ass 33 year old man, and if you spit in my god damn hair, no I don't know how to fight, but I am going to grab a blunt object and crack your skull. Yes I am willing to go to fucking jail if that happens, because I'm not going to put up with that shit, justice system be damned. And he just kind of apologized, and said he was sorry. And I told him, I never held a grudge against him, it just popped in my head because I was drunk as fuck, and for all intents and purposes from my point of view, you turned into an upstanding contributory member of society, and I never really hated you because after that, everytime I interacted with you, you were no longer a piece of shit towards me.

But yea, if someone's blatantly disrespectful to an extreme towards me. I don't know how to fight, but I will make sure you get physically hurt even if that involves fighting incredibly dirty, and if I have to go to jail or prison over that, well so be it, that's just how it is, I am willing to serve a jail or a prison sentence under certain circumstances."

Not because their heart isn't in the right place, but because of the fact that it never works. They always portray the bullied kids as kids who don't 'deserve' it, and it ultimately just wastes time because it's just going to either make things worse or make No Change on the situation at hand for those who are dealing with bullying currently. 

It just bugs me that they're supposedly ""trying"" to stop it, but they're using techniques that they know don't work in the slightest, and don't actually care about those of us who have either Went Through It or are Going Through It as they do these campaigns. "
224,"Message for male high school bullying victims from a former bully victim, now chill dude. ",14,1a1aff,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1a1aff/message_for_male_high_school_bullying_victims/,6,1362971068.0,"Hey guys,

I got so riled up when reading that bullying thread that I needed to come post something. I'm not sure what the protocol is here, but here I go.

I used to be bullied a lot. In elementary school, I was a small, skinny kid that liked to read a lot. I thought I was pretty normal. Larger, mean kids would torment me all the time. Imagine my hopelessness when I got to high school and found that some of these kids also got into that school. It didn't stop, and sometimes it got physical. One time I was put in a headlock on a staircase and I stumbled and severely sprained my ankle. I had to will myself pretty hard not to cry. I used to have dreams of my dispatching these kids in the hallway with martial arts moves I didn't know/didn't have the strength to pull off. They were still pretty satisfying dreams to have. Here's the thing. The bullshit your parents tell you doesn't mean much when you're in high school. The whole ""They're just insecure about themselves"" thing doesn't help when you feel emasculated and you feel like there is NOTHING YOU CAN DO. You feel hopeless, and your parents or teacher can't change any of that shit. I would like to say first off, that violence is not the answer, no matter what. Remember that despite what those goons say, you're a fucking gentleman. You solve problems by literally giving zero fucks. The kids bullying you, don't feel bad for them, don't pity them, don't feel any sympathy for them. Fuck them. They're fucking assholes. They had their chance in life to be nice, and they failed. What you need to do is recognize how strong of a person you are. How strong are you? You're getting bullied and you're still around. You're strong enough to cry and cry and feel emotions. You're strong enough to stand tall day in and day out when darkness is all around you. And think about the future. Think about how awesome your life is going to be, knowing that you're stronger than those kids deep down, and that when you move on to bigger and better places, the people you will befriend are going to be real, genuine people that care about you and your passions. You have every right to be enraged and angry and sad and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Sometimes, I just wanted to scream out at the top of my lungs. Why was this happening? What did I do to deserve it? You didn't do anything and the people bullying you are just douche bags, plain and simple. What you need to remember is that real gentlemen sit and wait, and get really strong internally. So strong that it turns you into a compassionate, and loving person. Senior year, when I thought they would finally stop because everyone was supposedly more ""mature,"" it didn't, and then I began to just laugh at these clowns. This one kid called me a faggot as he passed by me in the hallway. The thing was, he had already used that insult the day before. His creativity was lackluster and insult was unoriginal. I mean, for being a bully for so long, he was surprisingly bad at it. His delivery was stale. I just laughed at him. How empty his life must have been. But I didn't think about it too long. It's not worth the time and you certainly don't have time for that shit. I know this message might not have any closure and it's bit of a rant, but stand tall lads. And stay classy. "
225,I just spent the last half hour crying and typing why I'm not going back to chorus,12,ibes81,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ibes81/i_just_spent_the_last_half_hour_crying_and_typing/,2,1597702036.0,"Note: this chorus is made of women from 19 to however old they want to be. I'm 33 and the main two problems are at least the same age and should know better!

Whenever everyone is allowed to practice again in public,  I won't be joining you again. I wish I could say this to your faces so I knew people actually listened to me. I want to explain how it feels to be the person with a disability that people can't see. 

I have repeatedly told everyone that I have Huntington's Disease and I went through the trouble of explaining what that means for me even when it upset me because I have had people who claimed to be friends completely abandon me without a word because they apparently couldn't handle my disease and I have been left extremely hurt and jaded. 

I have also been verbally attacked when I was still able to work by rude people who thought it was any business of theirs that I was the only person in a chair.

My disease makes my life extremely hard and all I wanted was one place I felt I fit in and could get out of the house to. I don't drive because I get random movements and I don't want to be holding a steering wheel when that happens. 

I have extreme problems just walking lately because one of my movements is my leg. My disease also amplifies the depression that I already had. I have anxiety and I'm on the spectrum and I find it hard to feel like I actually belong somewhere. 

When I first came to the group,  I thought I found my home. Everyone seemed nice and happy and I got a ride to get me to the one time I was able to get out of the house .

The first problem was the person who lived near me and was asked to give me a ride was actually two faced and passive aggressive. She would hardly ever tell me if she was running late and for no reason I was aware of,  would be testy some days and I was just trying to have a happy time out because again,  this was all I had regularly.

The real first problem began when I dared to text after coming home because I could just tell it was going to be a problem, please don't text and drive. I don't need any help dying. My disease is fatal and I was just trying to have a little gallows humor to try and keep her from completely freaking out.  She actually told me that I was passive aggressive. 

But at this point,  I still barely knew anyone and I thought I was stuck with her,  or I would have run away the first time she didn't bother to tell me she was late and I was panicking 

The part that really showed me how little this person and the other board members cared came later and that's when Ruth Ann offered to go out of her way to get me there. 

Before this,  one of the board members came over with ms. Passive aggressive and with EXTREMELY poor attitude,  asked why I don't drive myself. The next time someone takes that tone with me,  I'm going to call them some choice words but I was interested in not making this more stupid than she chose to so I said, I have random movements because of my disease and I was holding a steering wheel, I could kill someone. 

I didn't say it with the same tone she took but I made it very clear that I was done with this because it's just crappy and you never spoke to me before and you started with an attitude? Says a lot about you and I probably should have left right then but I was still desperately trying to ignore these lovely, lovely ladies. 

The next thing was big for me and I pretty much never said a word to anyone after so I have no idea why everyone acted the way they did but frankly I'm tired. I'm tired of constantly feeling betrayed,  I'm tired of being the one nobody listens to and nobody cares about. 

This is what made me chose to ask Ruth Ann and I tried my best never to talk to the people there again unless it was stupid small talk. I would often have to wait at least 20 minutes for my ride to finish talking and finally take me home and any time I tried to be a part of the conversation, I was ignored and shouldered out.

I stopped trying and I would just sit near by so I wouldn't be forgotten, I have a specific anxiety about that. One time everybody talked for a half hour and without a single one of 6 remaining people saying a word to me, I was bored and hungry looking at my phone, they all went outside the church and turned off the lights on me. 

Again,  I had the darn nerve to say I was upset and I thought I was going to be left behind,  why couldn't a single person say they were leaving now? And all I got in response was,  I wasn't going to leave you.  That's literally nothing. You made me cry and panic and couldn't be bothered to say sorry even once. How's that for passive aggressive?

The rest. I had been talking to my seat neighbors for 3 years and suddenly at the start of this year,  no one will even look at me.  Never Mary Jane, she is a saint. But I can't see her through the two now ignoring me completely people. 

I thought I was friends with one of them at least and I was hurt but at this point,  I had spent the whole winter sick and I didn't have any fight left.

I actually had to go to the bathroom and cry when I heard everyone lying the words of Dear Evan Hansen.  I'm alone and I am always alone. I cry alone because I have literally 5 friends I can depend on and 1 is in another state. 

I came to the chorus for love and togetherness and I got bullied and hurt and I can't take it anymore. 

The truly upsetting thing is, I bet no one will even care that I'm gone. I'm not the popular b, if I knew I was signing up for more of high school attitude and people thinking they're sooooo important based on nothing but inflated ego, I would never have wasted my time. 

For the few really kind people who cared about each other and actually listened to me,  you were beacons in a very dark time. If you care about keeping in touch,  I'm still on Facebook. 

Good bye and good riddance to you terrible people who couldn't leave the person already suffering alone. I hope you're happy."
226,Did I deserve to be bullied in junior high,13,hsje5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/hsje5t/did_i_deserve_to_be_bullied_in_junior_high/,2,1594965678.0,"I'm 23F. I was 13F at the time this took place. I had almost more bullies than I could keep track of my 8th grade year but there is one that bothers me most up to this day. We'll call him Jon. So basically what happened is that there was this ""courtroom project"" we had in civics class where the class was split into two groups and one was the ""defender"" side of the assigned case and the other was the ""prosecuter"" side. Jon and I were put in the same group along with a few other kids. I can't remember which side we were on. So back then I remember feeling really ugly with my frizzy hair and depressed. I did not do well in school that year and was extremely behind, especially in math class. I felt like this group project was just forcing me into a place where I had no support or expertise and I felt totally lost/overwhelmed by it. So my group ended up doing my part of the project for me since I wouldn't do it which I feel kinda bad about now. Jon kept asking me if I was preparing myself to present my part of the project and I just gave him an annoyed expression in response. When it came time to present, I actually thought I did an ok job reading my lines despite not preparing but Jon was giving me an evil look along with a fist banging his other hand the whole time. So apparently he really resented me for not doing my part properly? Our side did end up winning. When we got out of class, he came up to me and told me how lucky I was that we won and that he would've chewed me out otherwise. After that, he started viciously harassing me on a daily basis whenever he could. Everytime he saw me he would give me a death glare and say ""faggot"". He loved saying this word to me most for some reason. He also loved to kick my zip up binder all the time as well. He would humiliate me in front of whoever else was around and say really demeaning stuff. He sat behind me at an assembly and was kicking the back of my chair and poking my back the whole time. I get that I probably should've made a better effort on that project but he treated me as if I murdered a loved one of his. What really sickened me about Jon tho is that all the teachers and other kids thought he was nice. He had that reputation so school staff didn't really take me seriously when I told them about this and Jon would act all innocent and sweet if he thought he was at risk of being caught in the act. His mom would help out at school events a lot and seemed like a nice person. He transferred to a Lutheran school in town for most of high school. Then senior year came and he was back. I didn't see him that much then but I did feel a mechanical pencil hit the back of my head like a dart as I was going downstairs one time. Idk 100% if it was him but I saw him sitting in the forum when I kept walking on my way to class and he looked up from his phone and gave me a possibly mischievous look. So Jon now has a wife and is in the marines. I tried to message him recently explaining my side of the story but that I still don't think that justifies what he did. I was very tactful. No response back from him . He has declined my friend request before so I assume he maybe doesn't regret it. I was hoping he'd matured past that. For some reason this has been really tearing me up lately and I can't get him or the past situation out of my mind. Do you think I deserved this at all? What do you think of what happened and everything? Thanks!

Tldr: I was bullied in 8th grade for not doing my part in a project, did I deserve it?"

Ps. I am not bullied at the moment so do not suggest me that my uncle or whatever should punch my bullies. That would not help and it is a waste for time. I have read many books and articles online. Sharing your experience may he helpful but do not make it too long. Also tips not self harming would help me since my parents are a bit worried about my wrll being.

229,"Bully thinks its OK to mess with social life, doesn't EVER get punished.",12,foa539,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/foa539/bully_thinks_its_ok_to_mess_with_social_life/,7,1585102952.0,"This is my first post, so please excuse any errors.

So I was doing my first year of middle school (6th grade), and went to a school that didn't feed from my Elementary school, and this school was k-8 so people had their own groups of friends, and nobody wants a nerd (me) in their group. I eventually find a kid, we will call him B for bully, as he is the bully of this story. At the start, he was a friend and we exchanged Xbox names and play PVZ GW2 and Fortnite. We eventually play Halo 5 as it is only online campaign multiplayer (my little brother was NOT a fan) and then did PVZ GW2 and my brother cried due to B constantly killing him. At the time I just told my brother he was being a crybaby, but eventually got in trouble because I was ""being sassy"" when I told B to stop on my mother's instructions. 

After a few weeks I was able to play again. However, B said he would only play Fortnite with me. I just wanted to play Minecraft and some Halo CE. It goes on similarly for about a semester. Except for the worst decision ever. I was pressured and lent him $40 so he could get Fortnite V-bucks, even though he always says how he gets $600 every birthday. Until later when he starts saying inappropriate things in front of my 8-year-old brother. I go on an Epcot field trip and I was in his group. I loved Epcot and enjoyed even the educational part. However, B was fussing over it and not being able to go on Test Track on top of it all. Later, we do have a good dinner in Mexico, and get ready to leave. In the bus ride back, I ask if I can use his phone to text my mom (I didn't get a phone until 7th grade), but he just says that I should get my own phone and that he is not going to let me use his. Now, most of the kids at this school live close, so not too much of a problem unless you live 30 FREAKIN' MINUTES AWAY! My mom needed an eta so she wasn't late. Eventually a kid who I had only started talking to that day lent me his phone. The entire bus ride he rubbed it in my face that he had a phone and I didn't. Needless to say this was the last day I was friends with him.

That night I told my mom about everything. I also blocked him on Xbox and Fortnite, which caused him to start telling me things that you would NEVER say to a friend. He said a phrase that meant either you're friends with me and I help you or you aren't and I make your life miserable. He also said ""you suck"" and ""Well now get the f\*\*\* out of my life!"". I wasn't bothered because I had a sinister plan. The day I came back to school, I would act like he wasn't even there or even existed. Well, he was pissed and kept his promised and made me look bad in front of some kids that  was trying to be friends with. Later he makes a conversation about how he is happy I'm not his friend because he has plenty of other things he can do. I say ""you're welcome"" and leave. Later he is insulting me in front of the kids from before, but he has turned them against me. (these kids used to hate him btw) I tell him to stop and it is not ok to do this, then he says that he doesn't listen to short stacks like me and says ""So come at me hash brown!"". This was insulting my height and the fact I don't have much muscle mass (now I have more, but this was then.) I tell the school and they get evidence that he is a bully. However, it took a lot of ""well next time it happens, we will launch an investigation"". The school didn't really care I was being bullied.(bad move considering I was one of their best students). He only gets a call home and bullying doesn't stop, because as I infer, he wasn't punished as that weekend he was playing his Xbox. The time he gets ISS is when he calls a girl a b\*\*\*\*. Still no punishment from mother.

I later decide that I've had enough because I've lost $40 and a lot of self esteem- I mean, he was supposed to pay me on his b-day! Also, he said he would pay $60 if I went to his party(yeah, no.) I leave the school after 2nd semester and go to the school that feeds from my previous one, so I have friends. Of course there is still teasing about my height and being a nerd, but nothing I can't deal with. I later find out from a friend from 6th grade that B got expelled because he beat up another kid. And still no punishment. Yeesh."

Something which I am sure everyone who has ever been bullied has been told in their lives, is to ""grow a thicker skin"". And further from that, has probably seen or been told ""in that case the internet probably isn't for you"" alongside ""go to therapy"". This is familiar?  
Well, I don't have a thick skin, and I am unable to magically grow one. I am almost 40 years old woman and show no sign of becoming immune to hurtful comments or other people having control over the way that I feel. Lord knows I have tried.  
I have not been coddled in life, I have been through a lot, dealing everyday with mental and physical health issues, I have had loves ones die accidents, suicides, had abusive relationship (and good ones also), travelled a bit the world, been to rehab, had various jobs, pets, lovers, experiences. Years of therapy.  

Yet all of my experiences in life, I have not built this wonderful ""thick skin"" that some people have. I think it is something either you are born with, or you are not born with. Or did I just miss the point of no return. Perhaps there was a point in my younger years that I could have changed things, before I was broken. But I cannot change the past.  

Did anyone here ""grow thick skin"" past age 30? It is possible?  

Recently I have been receiving lot of nasty remarks in the online game that I play. They are targeted, personal remarks that this man makes to me because he senses a weakness in me, he is typical abuser. Unfortunately it is a very small community and so not like the popular games where you will rarely see same person twice. We play a lot the same people every evening. There are other that have problem with him also but the admins of the server do not really care. In the past I have approached this type of person in private and talked with them to see if we can be on better terms, sometimes it works and they are actually reasonable human beings, we have even become friends who can support each other. But this man, I don't think he will be so reasonable. I am debating a lot in my head to message him or not. I know it may backfire.  
I left the game for two days now to have a break from him, but it is making me upset and also angry, at him, at myself for caring at all what some ______ thinks of me on internet. But it does. It hurts. He hurts me.  

I really wish that I was not so sensitive. That I could ignore it, or laugh at it.  

Thank you if anyone has read this. Stay strong everybody."
234,"I was bullied by my parents, then bullied more at college, and I'm scared I'll be bullied wherever I go. I'm also dealing with mental illness and would appreciate advice on how to cope (Long post and trigger warning for suicide and self-harm)",13,e2txxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/e2txxz/i_was_bullied_by_my_parents_then_bullied_more_at/,4,1574951095.0,"This has been something that's been troubling me for a long time. I've posted about this in other subreddits but not this one. 

When I was growing up, my parents were awful to me. I was beaten, got death threats, got called stupid and told to kill myself, etc. I developed some emotional issues because of this that probably impacted future relationships. I was introverted in high school too and not very popular, although I wasn't bullied much.

My sophomore year of college, I had a big friend group, mostly people who lived on my floor. They gradually got more and more toxic towards me over time. Before the year ended, I was self-harming and having suicidal ideations, mostly because of them. But what made it worse was that I allowed myself to be bullied. I'm submissive and bad at standing up for myself and I'm also gullible and easy to emotionally manipulate. I had a bully in middle school, but he was at least upfront about how mean he was, and I didn't take him too seriously because most people in our grade didn't like him, and I'd have friends sticking up for me. With these people, I was manipulated into thinking that they were good people and I deserved to be hurt, and that was why it hurt so badly. When I look back on some of the things they did, I'm shocked at how mean they were, but I'm also shocked that I was stupid enough to put up with the things they did. (I feel like going into details would make this post too long and no one would care much about the details). 

I got obsessed with those people, and I kept dwelling on whether they were really bad people, or if they were good people who made mistakes. One person in the group was my roommate (who I was friends with in high school) and a couple mutual friends of ours told me stuff like that she was a good person but was bad at communicating or that she didn't want to hurt me but was just stressed, but that was hard for me to believe. One person in the group did apologize to me after, and he mentioned something about how it was hard to go against the group. The apology helped a bit but didn't cure me of all the mental health issues I've experienced since then. It's been over a year since I dealt with that toxicity but I'm still pretty mentally fucked up from it. And since I was bullied by my parents before, I'm worried that this will become a cycle and I'll get bullied again, and I won't have the guts to stand up for myself then either."

It has been around at every corner of my life, so it has dragged on for such a long time. Growing up, it was my dad, major abusive stuff, then first gf was emotionally exploitative and managed to slap me a few times (uncalled for), peers at school for being poor and for being good in class, about 3 different jobs I've held then finally friends (which I'm trying to block out of my life now). My psychiatrist tells me that I seek these unhealthy individuals because that's what I grew up with, and in my relationships with them I try to change them because that's what I kept trying with my dad. It didn't work on my dad, didn't work with my ex, ex-bosses or soon-to-be ex-friends. Now that I'm aware of it, I want to stop this behavior, I think it has hurt me in my life more than it has helped. I'm sure I can do it, I've done a lot of hard things in my life, but my main problem is that I'm just furious with it like all the time. Even if I wake up on a nice day, by the time I have my coffee or whatever, my mind would have dug up someone that bullied me, whether I responded to them or took the high road situation, doesn't matter, and just dwel on it until I'm so agitated all damn day.

236,Watching your bully prosper,12,dyoqrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dyoqrk/watching_your_bully_prosper/,12,1574218232.0,"I think the only reason I'm posting this is because of a need to get it off my chest. Long time ago, twenty years ago I was on a gaming website. Got into a fracas with some knob over an argument that in retrospect was about as trivial as it got. Well, that's turned us into deadly enemies because ""agree to disagree"" wasn't in this character's vocabulary. He proceeded to try and attack, torment and annoy me any time I was on the site anyway he could, for my part I attempted to take the high ground and just stop speaking to him. 

The mods didn't really seem to care, they pretty much treated the place like 4/chan, you had to do something REALLY bad to get your butt kicked off. After years of this he was rewarded for his behavior by being made a mod for the site whereupon I finally ditched the place because that was the limit of what I could tolerate. 

Fast forward a decade or two, he's now publishing books in that setting and is tight with the games creators and has made a rep for himself as a nice guy. The only reason I even know this is I made an intuitive leap and determined who it was years after the fact not long after reading one of his books, and I can't help but think ""If only you knew this guy for real."" This was the guy I once flat out told if he ran his bullying mouth in real life like he did online someone would put his ass in a dumpster and watched him explode in a pedantic rage.

Honestly it's just one of those things that makes you sit down, shake your head and wonder if Karma is even a thing. I've seen about half a dozen cases where someone who put the A in asshole got clean away with it, and wound up being rewarded for it but this is probably one of the more egregious ones. Meanwhile, here I am laboring just to keep what little sanity I have decades after the fact. 

I'd put it behind me, but the game is still something I enjoy, and each time I get a little nostalgia and start tinkering with it those feelings eventually echo back and poison it. I've been able to leave other bullies behind, let their memories die out and move on but this guy truly was like the sand in the oyster, and no pearl is forth coming.

I remember my abuse as constant. My parents couldn’t help as I was taught me to love everyone and turn the other cheek (thanks Catholic indoctrination). I was alone and couldn’t articulate what was wrong because I was failing at everything I was told to do. Make friends, let it roll off your back, ignore them. I was a failure 100%, but I could understand why they couldn’t just STOP. 

Why was I so fucking special that I was the target from the moment I got on the bus until I stepped off it at home? 

At 40, I told my mom all of this. She said she never could understand why I’d come home crying everyday. I never told her why. I told her because I was letting her down because I just couldn’t do the things she was telling me to do. I couldn’t be friends with them. I couldn’t just let it go. I couldn’t. Therefore, I was a failure, in my mind. 

It is PTSD as I do keep having flashbacks and dreams. But I think it gets better every time I open up to my mom about it. She’s genuinely sorry for not helping me more, which helps but honestly, what was she to do? 

Today, kids can go to advocates and counselors in a safe and confidential way to get help. Hell, they can eat lunch away from the other kids if they have to. That would’ve been heaven for me.

Be it openly practising homosexual or watching My Little Pony at your 30s, its quite a common to see an uproar over bullying over stuff that doesn't hurt others in the Western news. For example.

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2014/03/18/my-little-pony-backpack-banned-school-north-carolina/6565425/

Some self defense instructors such as Marc MacYong always mention though that the best way to avoid bullying is to avoid doing something that attracts the bully's attention and makes him feel emotionally strong about to get involved with you. So this question is more of an opinion one (though heavily related to bullying). 

Would you fellow posters recommend to avoid doing something such as wearing a Sailor Moon t-shirt in public or bringing around a barbie doll and playing with it in university? I mean the assumption of dignity culture of the right for the individual to be themselves is such that I notice everyone is ignoring the elephant in the room that is AVOIDING attracting attention by doing abnormal stuff in the first place! I mean the fact something as minor as banning My Little Pony backpacks at school is so controversial in western culture it made it to front page news.

Is it worth trying to follow the ""right to be yourself"" at the possibility of being  a target by predators?"

Because I’m white. I’m skinny, tall, reasonably ‘conventionally’ attractive. My parents raised me together and didn’t have relationship issues. I’ve never had to worry about where my next meal would come from or whether I’d have a roof over my head at night.

It started after I started homeschooling in second grade, attending the local elementary school for choir, and later, band. My classmates had known me our whole lives - I live in a very small town in the rural Midwest - but after I stopped going to public school full time, I was different. The odd one out.

They’d generally stick to the same material - my height, my weight, and my tomboy attitude. It only got worse when I got to middle school, then high school. My district has separate elementary schools for the two bigger towns in my area (the one I live in and a somewhat larger one 10 minutes away), but sends all the students to the same middle and high schools, and to the students from the other town… well, I was a new novelty. I currently stand 6’1” and 130 lbs (19F) and I’ve always had this y’all, scrawny figure.

In high school, I finally made friends, but all of my friends have had harder lives than me - broken families, financial struggles, etc. They’re generally really cool about my background being so drastically different from theirs, but occasionally something comes up, not usually about my appearance, but backhanded comments about how I’ve never experienced hardships like them. I’ve never claimed to, all I ever did was try to be understanding and supportive. Things like, “What do you mean, you know your mother/father,” or, “You don’t know what it’s like to be hungry,” or, “You’re a rich kid, you’ll never get it.” It’s true I’ve never experienced those things, and yeah, I don’t wish too, but I just tried to help, and the way these things would be said made me feel like I was a bad person for having those things. 

But most of this happened years ago, and I’m mostly past it, except for recent events that started dragging it all up.

It’s taken me a long time to get comfortable with my body - between being built like a stick bug and, later, my self-harm scars (I also have a history of BPD, anxiety, depression, PTSD…), I was never really comfortable in my own skin. As summer comes around again and I break out my shorts and tank tops, I’m getting a lot more comments about my weight, ranging from ‘Eat a damn burger’ to inappropriate, provocative comments that make me feel… gross. In addition to that, I feel like I’ve worn out everyone’s sympathy for my mom’s passing (she died at the beginning of November ‘18, pancreatic cancer) - the last time I mentioned how I missed her, I got a lecture on how my friend wished his dad was dead instead of just gone from his life, because ‘then he’d have an excuse for never being in his life.’

As I mentioned in the title, I feel bad even writing this up here - intellectually, I know this is a support board, and I believe no one would come after me for the things I’m hurting over, I’m scared to put this out there. I feel like this whole thing is really rambley and doesn’t really convey everything I want to say, but it gets the gist of it across and it takes a weight off my chest to finally let it out.

Thank you for reading."

I'm only about 3 weeks away from graduating highschool now, and I've been looking through elementary and middleschool photos. For basically my whole life, I've been repulsed by my own appearance. This has caused a few romantic relationships to fail because I found myself so repulsive I would develop paranoia so severe I would obsess over knowing every little thing about my partners whereabouts and such. I realized this was unhealthy for both of the people involved so I eventually stopped dating altogether. Anyways, back to my original point. I've always had a very distorted image of myself in my mind. I haven't been diagnosed with body dysmorphia, but I know I have it, especially based on the shock I felt when I looked at old photos of myself. I didn't look like a grotesque creature that deserved to be guillotined, I just looked like a normal kid. I wasn't disgustingly obese and my though my front teeth were big, I didn't look ugly. Being told by people you find beautiful that you look like a donkey or a chipmunk and being called ""bucky"" or ""bucktooth"" does a lot more damage than you'd think. It got to where I'd cover my mouth at almost all times. If I laughed or talked or relaxed my jaw, I would put a hand over it to avoid being laughed at. I remember always sleeping with a blanket wrapped around my head, right under my nose. My reasoning for this was so specific and obscure; If someone broke into the house while I slept, I was sure they'd kill me if they saw how ugly my ""buckteeth"" were. Out of habit, I still sleep with the same blanket wrapped around my head from time to time. It took me ages to get out of these habits, though I fall back into them every once and a while if a friend just happens to take a photo of me from an angle that shows my teeth. I've always been poor, so braces were never an option. Of course I was bullied for other things, too, but the name-calling and laughing in my face over just my two front teeth completely distorted the way I saw my face. Looking back, I just see a normal kid. Just someone who can easily blend in. Nothing special or bad. And I think that's the worst part; I was singled out so aggressively because of something I had no power over, even though there wasn't anything wrong with me."

I was bullied severly in secondary school, due to weight, parents divorcing, ethnicity, you name it, there was a reason for it! I considered myself to be a kind kid at the time, considerate and friendly, but always questioned myself why do people hate me so much to make me feel like this?

At the time my parents were going through the process of divorce, my siblings didnt want to associate with me at the time because I chose to live with my mother, and my mother was going through her own issues, so I felt very alone during that dark time. 

For years after, socially I struggled. I couldnt look people in the eye, I felt like a failure, there were times where I wanted to end it all. I couldnt form normal relationships with people for many years, and held fear and anxiety for a long time, rarely leaving my home, in fear of my bullies.

Fast forward to the future, I'm now married, and have a great life, but still to this day, I feel like I need to redeem myself against the individuals who put me through what they did, yet I feel great fear and anger. Surely you'd think these feelings would of passed by now? It's been over 10 years...

There is not a day where I do not think of my bullies, even though I have progressed in many ways of my life, I feel as if something is holding me back, I lose sleep over it, and I dont feel like a man because I still experience the fears and anxieties of what happened...

Any advice? Anyone else feel like this?"

(i am 11 years old.) this is based off another rumour that a kid on my bus asked me out. before you say 'tell a teacher' i would like to tell you i have severe social anxiety and cannot do that. my friends ditched me after hearing this and i have nobody to stand up for me. i also have multiple disorders, and most people do not believe anything i say.  i am also bullied about my eye, which has half of it's retina missing, making people think i'm a freak. i don't know what to do and i am very scared."
248,Because I was a chubby kid,13,atn2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/atn2d2/because_i_was_a_chubby_kid/,5,1550899497.0,"As the title says, I was a chubby kid. By the time I turned 13, I'd shed the weight and came out a beautiful butterfly. But the fat followed me. 

Kids cut my hair on the bus. They put gum on my seat. They purposefully hit me with baseballs and volleyballs in gym. They threatened me which led to mediation where they verbally bashed me (6 against one). They tripped me in the halls where multiple people just walked over me before one hero held out his arms to stop the crowd so I could get up. (I never thanked you because of how embarrassed I was so thank you) 

My parents decided to move us out of state. I had planned on staying one more week before the move, but had to leave early. One student had threatened to bring his ninja stars and knives to school to hurt me. 

I've never really spoken about this. I hated school back then. I try to think about how much better it was in earlier days, but it really wasn't. Kids teased me about the weight. One day, my fifth grade teacher moved our desks around. I was put with my bullies so I pulled my teacher aside and asked to be moved. She said, and I'm quoting exactly ""If I were your age, I would hate you too""."
249,Why do people think they can apply their own personal time table to when victims of bullying are 'supposed to get over it'?,13,ajprbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ajprbd/why_do_people_think_they_can_apply_their_own/,6,1548456756.0,"Be they the bullies themselves or random people, it seems there's always this group of people waiting in the wings to judge you for holding a grudge, for having that chip on your shoulder, for still being angry 'after all these years'. The way I see it, if someone disrespects you for no good reason and goes to great lengths to endlessly torment you and make you feel like shit, then that person isn't worth any of my respect. I guess it depends on how bad it was and if they sincerely feel bad for how they treated you and sincerely apologize for it. 

&#x200B;

I use to have these rich spoiled kids try to run me off the road on the way home from school, I rode a bike home and most times it was just to scare me but one time they actually went too far and actually ran me off the side of a hill and ended up in the hospital with a broken arm and no bike for transportation. They weren't sorry and even tried to do it again a few more times after that, even when I would take different routes home. If any of those guys were to try to apologize to me today, HELL NO I wouldn't forgive them. And yes I'm still angry about it. Who gets to decide when we're 'supposed' to 'stop being angry' about unfair shit that happens to us, especially when the ones who do it to us have little to regrets about doing it and would probably do it again if given the opportunity? Fuck self righteous assholes who think this way. "

I remember one of them telling me he was going to “masturbate over my dead naked body”. I would laugh at this nowadays, but as a little middle schooler I didn’t find it funny. 5 years later I’m now a senior and I still despise them.

I am 19 years old and years ago I was bullied. I was in 7th grade at the time all of this happened. I had moved to a place in the mountains and had to transfer to a different school. There was a girl at this school who clearly did not like me. That's when the rumors started. Classmates would constantly make fun of me behind my back and even so that I could see it. This wouldn't even compare to the outrageous things that they had said about me. Rumors would go around all of the time. If it wasn't one thing it was always something new. It started with me being a wh*re then being lesbian (which there is absolutely nothing wrong with they just thought it was funny) or being a drug addict. The one thing that completely got under my skin was the word retarded. I remember being in art class and one of the most popular girls in the school had said that I should ""wear a little shirt"" that had the word retard printed across it. There was a time where I had overheard one of the girls saying that no on likes me. 

Later on in the year, one boy punched me hard in the back of my shoulder and another time we had gotten tickets that were used for a type of reward system. If you got a ticket, you got free candy. One boy ripped the ticket out of my hand and tore it right in half in front of my face. No one did anything, they all just sat there and laughed at me. I remember the kid saying that ""I didn't deserve it"" he also kept asking me if i was going to cry. I feel like the girl who started the rumors still haunts me to this day. The problem is, I know her instagram and constantly look at it, comparing myself to her. How do I stop doing this? How do I let go of the hatred and negative feelings that arise everytime I think about it?"

I’m trying to determine when can a person categorically say ‘Yes I was bullied and that person was a bully’... I’m having trouble distinguishing it as a man due to the impact of abuse growing up, school bullying and then ‘banter’ (which may have been bullying) at University and afterwards... 


It feels to me as if this world comprises of the bullied and bullies... If you don’t stand up for yourself then people walk all over you and purposefully hurt you in order to get their way... Some people are more kind that others but there’s a lot of intentionally hurtful people out there who do so to get their way or simply to hurt others before they get hurt as a defence strategy...

Before I got to high school, Kids had a pretty well known image of who I was, unsocial, serious, frank and straight to the point and, most importantly careless of what other people thought of me. I never had any friends throughout the entirety of high-school but that wasn’t of any importance to me at the time. I was more worried about schoolwork getting completed to the best of my ability. I always thought friends were a waste of valuable time while in school, but, true friends are a must after you graduate, you never know when/how they will benefit you IRL. I was always a straight to the point person and never joked around with anybody who wasn’t in my close circle/family. I always kept a straight posture, face, walk. Everything I did was professional and well done. Rare to see in high-school nowadays. I always wore professional attire, and never looked like I was going to school, rather, I always looked like I was going to work, working at a law firm. When it comes to fights and beefs between students, I was rarely messed with, I’m 5”6 broad shoulders, heavy built. I always went to the gym, for whatever reason, if I was bored, I went to the gym, happy, sad, angry, stressed, you name it, I was at the gym practically 24/7. That’s why I was never struck with depression or whatnot from having no friends. Exercise truly boosts your emotions and helps with everything throughout your body. Having a fit mind and body always gave me confidence in everything I did, I knew I was always ahead of the game compared to my classmates. My last point to make is that, I never cared of what other students thought of me, that’s why I was truly a free man, when you have no care for what others think of you, then no one can hurt your feelings or make you feel bad about yourself. All of these traits by no means came with ease. Throughout grades 1-5 I was bullied, day in-day out. I was harassed physically and verbally, I dealt with obesity as a child and that made those few years a living nightmare for me. I never wanted to go to school and always cried at night in my room as a child, even though I was quite young to remember, there were some traumatic events that took place in my life that I’d rather not share publicly. At the time of writing this, I’m 19 and pursuing my career as a truck driver. I hope this write-up inspires someone to show their true colours and have no care for what anyone thinks. Your boiii Danny, stay safe. Peace."

Everything about me she all of a sudden hated, no matter what I did she was never happy with me. I felt this distance and spoke with her yet she always lied to my face and told me everything was fine and she didn’t hate me. I wonder if she had always disliked me and pretended to be my friend all along. I should have known judging by how she was so quick to hate or judge others who supposedly were her friends as well, I just somehow never thought I would be the one she turned against nor did I realize the capability she held to be so nasty. I haven’t spoken in months to her as I cut her off and told her that I didn’t feel as though we were friends and it was better off that we ended that relationship. Yet I still hear things daily from others that she is saying about me, without getting into too much detail she is straight up slandering me and I just want it to end. Again, I never did anything to her and gave her many chances to come forward and speak to me about any issues as superficial as they may be that she had with me. Yes she didn’t even like my clothing or makeup choices if that tells you anything. I’m glad she is no longer in my life but I wish it was entirely wiped off my plate, I can’t stand the fact that she continues to put my name in her mouth in such derogatory ways and slanders me through social media. I don’t want to contact her about it because of her love of retaliation, she has already found a way to hurt me through that and I don’t want to provide any more opportunities. Anyway that was long thanks for staying with me if you did! Yes I am an adult so this immature behaviour is ridiculous I feel like I’m back in middle school."

I just wanted to share this experience. I recently started volunteering at my mom’s work and she is a special-ed teacher. Her kids join the general-ed kids during PE (1st period) and during lunch at the cafeteria. During my first few days of volunteering I noticed that NONE of them approach or try to socialize with my mom’s kids. They’re literally treated like outcasts. A lot of my mom’s students are high-functioning, they try to socialize with the general-ed community but get turned away or ignored, it’s so disappointing. Earlier today at lunch I noticed a group of kids laughing calling the attention of more kids to come over and point at one of the students, I wanted to know what was so funny , I found out they were laughing and mocking one my mom’s students because her pants were a bit low and she was flapping her arms. At that moment my mind went kinda blank and my sight was getting darker I was fuming angry and I started to point that kid out to the other staff, I was going to tell a yard duty person and I was going to talk to the kid and his group of friend’s one of the staff members grabbed my shoulder and said no which made me more mad cause they didn’t want to stand up for the kids. The staff member said that kids nowadays are disrespectful and even if I were to tell them off it would go from one ear and out the other. She said it wouldn’t change their minds about finding the kids funny and they’ll continue being rude either way plus she added “if they tell their parents, they can twist the story and sue the school and you can lose your job. You’re on the losing end cause he can claim that you were harassing him ( a minor) or worse because these kids are bigger they are not afraid of adults they can physically fight back” — this statement made me annoyed. I understand her point this is so unfair! Like so I’m just gonna have to ignore, walk on thin ice because kids today are “scary” the staff didn’t even want me to tell the office or the other yard duty people cause these kids are brats and their parents get the best lawyers. Just a little back story the school that I work at is in this area where a good majority of the parents are doctors, engineers and lawyers...they easily sue and we’ve had a couple of cases this year for the funniest things.

I’m just so mad about today that I couldn’t help or stop them. I feel like I want to protect the kids but can’t the world is so cruel sometimes."
268,What to do if it’s in the family?,10,fbbih7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/fbbih7/what_to_do_if_its_in_the_family/,6,1583006065.0,"I have recently come to the very sad realisation that my parents have employed shame and embarrassment tactics all my life to try and get me to conform to their rigid expectations of how they believe my life should go.

My opinions on how I want to live my life are instantly judged and dismissed as “wrong” if they don’t align with my parents’ “happiness formula”. There is no room for discussion. When I have tried to continue calmly in the hope they’d open up to hearing what I have to say, I am met with aggression and insults, which will persist if the topic is raised again, or may come out of the blue and delivered bluntly to try and shock me. My brother has now jumped on the bandwagon and is also perpetuating the same behaviour, which was a real surprise as he hasn’t done this before.

I think my deviation from their happiness formula is perceived as invalidating their own life choices. The very sad irony is that my parents aren’t happy themselves, and I wonder if they subconsciously hope that if I follow the formula that they feel should’ve worked for them and have success then they can live vicariously through that “success”.

For context, my parents want me to be: straight, thin, dating an extroverted man with no dependents, married and having kids ASAP. Literally none of this aligns to what makes me who I am and happy. 

I can’t get my family to listen and I’ve completely withdrawn from interacting with them, to great sadness on my part as I generally seek harmony in my life and feel very at sea without it. But most other examples of bullying I see on this group usually have some escalation route available - eg a child at school who is able to report bad behaviour to a teacher.

This post has turned into a longer script than I anticipated but I’m wondering how to move forwards now? I won’t betray my values for the sake of pleasing my parents anymore as I have done all my life, clearly this isn’t being received well by them, but I believe there’s always a middle ground and I’m drawing a blank on how to find it if they don’t want to discuss things with me. Should I just accept this is a lost cause?

Thanks to anyone who reads and replies."

What should we do now?

\*Note: He has told the teacher previously, there is a security clip, the teacher said that it was provoked (my little brother was provoked), IT HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE LAST YEAR and nothing has been done.  


Update (19/02/2020): After the meeting we've just had, we've found out that one of them or all of them got suspended, we're not sure as we were never told if it was the group or those who threw the sticks and stones.  


In terms of the school, they had said that violence should not be used and is not used in the real world. Even though my dad has used it before to protect someone on the streets before, so it appears as if the school is like what some of you have said, not taking responsibility etc."

For a while now they have been throwing paper rolled up into balls at my lunch fable, I didn't think. Much of it at first, I just thought it was accidentally going in my direction, but it continued, soon they started staring and laughing at me, making me feel more self consious then I already am.

One day I was going to my first period English and as I was coming up the stairs the group of kids with their other friends, all turn around, start laughing and pointed and they all say ""guys, look, its the feminine man!"" And as I'm walking I feel that invalid-ness, the embarrassment, I feel as I'm almost about to cry and it just hurt overall. I'm also going through the process of transitioning to a state where I feel comfortable (I'm gender non conforming), and after they said that it hit me deep, and now ever since (this was on Valentine's day) that sentence has been engraved into my brain, its like on a replay, it keeps reminding me I'm being bullied, I've reported them, my sisters friends have also reported them and found out their names and grades, I really hope it'll stop once I come back from February break.

They'll say or do things to try to provoke a reaction out of me, to get me fired.

Today, one of them announced her husband's birthday. I said ""Happy Birthday!"" like any normal person would do. She reacted defensively as if she thought I had practically proposed to him. 

Is this bullying, if so what kind of bullying is this? It seems like a clique of my female managers feels genuinely threatened by me."

277,Why do people stop bullying you when they find out you are trained in Martial Arts?,11,efebpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/efebpr/why_do_people_stop_bullying_you_when_they_find/,8,1577293038.0,"I've had experiences at school and at work as an adult where I was bullied for being a weird introvert (Partially why I started doing martial arts in the first place). Because of me being an introvert, I do have trouble understanding some human behaviours. 

One including where a guy at work would always mistreat me at work and look down on me like I'm a piece of shit. One day at lunch, my co-worker wanted to see one of my  MMA fights on YouTube. (I'm not in the UFC or Bellator, thus why I'm still working a full time job). We had the fight playing on the office TV where my bully was present and saw the fight where I had won by KO in the first round.

Ever since then he hasn't been talking to me at all. If anything I'd thought he'd try provoke me to fight him since he's this 'tough' guy but no, he just leaves me alone now?

I'm just wondering because I've grown up competing in BJJ tournaments as a kid and MMA as an adult and I always wanted to compete against people who were better than me to see how I'd match against them or to learn from them. I've always used that logic outside of fighting as well such as Competitive Gaming. 

But this bully of mine doesn't seem to have the same mentality as me and I thought he'd get excited to fight me but he didn't. 

I've had experiences at school where I had to defend myself and when I'd beat up the bully, his friends would jump in and attack me and I'd have to run away (Being trained in martial arts doesn't mean you can fight multiple people at once like in action movies)"

I’m an 18 year old senior in high school and I go to an all-girls Catholic school and I’ve been going since my Freshman year. Throughout my entire high school experience, fellow classmates have harassed me, called me out, exposed me, etc. I thought things would get better, but now we jump to this year. 

I recently joined a group chat on iMessage to receive updates of important events from my classmates, however every time I so much as breathe in the group chat, I get harassed. Everybody talks about their problems and relate to each other, but when I talk about my problems, everyones all like “we don’t care” or “ok we get it”. Once, I said something about sitting on a toilet seat and they harassed me with “lessons” on how to hover over the toilet seat, as if I was doing something wrong in my life. For the most part, it’s mainly them trying to antagonize me, probably because I’m quiet and they want to see if I‘m able to lose my temper. I’ve told them about how they like to push my buttons, but every time I do so, they follow up with “we never said that” or “who was doing that?” when literally 5 seconds ago they would harass me about something I did or said. I’ve reported this to the staff, but none of them are helpful. They either tell me to “ignore them” or they get me in trouble for losing my temper at them. 

I’ve recently exited the group chat, but the bullying keeps happening in the premises of the school, and It’s really frustrating because I feel like no one is there to help me through it. I only have maybe two or three friends in my grade because everyone else seems to prefer harassing me over trying to be my friend. My only true friends are people I’ve met in college through my siblings. They seem to care way more about my well-being and happiness. I already suffer from severe anxiety and depression, and the bullying seems to fuel it so much that I can’t help but to isolate myself from the rest of my class. I was really hoping that this year would my easiest, most successful school year, but now I just kinda wish that I graduate already so I can get away from the constant abuse because I can’t take it anymore."

SORRY FOR HOW LONG THIS IS!!! (please help?)

alright, this story starts around 4th year. (5th grade in America) i moved into a new house and started taking the bus to school. the first day on the bus stop, i started talking to this girl (we can call her opal, not close to her real name) and she's pretty nice. these two brothers come up and greet her, they see me and say hi aswell, realizing i'm new. (brother 1 will be duke and brother 2 will be peter, not close to real names) we get on the bus and sit in the back because we were the highest grade in the school, making us the 'CoOest cCrazy KidS'. ofc this happens every morning, pretty genuine convos. THEN, i started riding the afternoon bus. i ofc sit in the back with a girl i knew from my class and notice my bus stop friends and talk to them. now this was when duke and i's realationship changed. he started to act out in front of his friends and pretending to roast me, ofc i ignore him. but soon he starts to make one specific comment that seriously bothered me. it got more and more intense, even to a point where he would find me in halls, the lunchroom, sometimes even the bathroom just to say this to me. this continues on until the beginnning of 5th year (6th grade). i got on the bus and looked at him, i was already super pissed so that didn't help. he started his usual stuff and it got in my head. IT GOT IN MY HEAD. the ONE thing i tried to NEVER let happen happened. so i looked over and said ""i swear to god, if you don't shut your mouth."" and ofc he's like what, what, what u gunna doo ughghhghh. i looked up front, we were getting closer to our stop, i made sure the driver lady wasn't looking and hopped across the isle into his seat. i shoved him down in the crack of the seats where your legs go, smacked him, and said loudly in his face ""ARE YOU FUCKING DONE? ARE YOU FUCKING DONE?"" he said nothing. i said it again. ""okay, okay. sorry berry."" ""YOU BETTER BE."" i hopped back in my seat and slid all the way to the window. pissed off. his chill brother calls my name and tells me ""haha he said it again, berry! what you finna do? we bout to get off!"" i said NOTHING. we got off the bus and i stopped so everybody else stopped. i waited for the bus to pull away and chased him down the street. everyone watched and i stopped him by grabbing his backpack. he looked at me and i backhanded him, and smiled. fuck man, i smiled as i felt my hand and wrist start to burn and saw he curl away and rub his face with his hand as it turned red. my bus friend from earilier (the one i didn't name from my class) was in her driveway, watching everything. he dropped his backpack and started to run towards me, i had started walking away. I SPRINTED directly into my friend's driveway, and as soon as i started to the back, running around the side she screamed ""LITTLE BOY, GTFO OF MY YARD OR I'M CALLING MY DAD AND THE COPS!"". i fucking stopped. he turned around and went to his house i laughed and went right home.

i haven't told anyone this. the problem is the fact that it is 7th year now, (8th grade) and he is still scared of me? like he starts to walk faster if i'm in a general like 5 ft vicinity of him. his brother, peter is super cool however, his brother is scared of me i think and it kind of makes me sad? like i feel bad for making him so scared of me. i wish i hadn't done it.

he still says it but when he does i just kiss my hand and he runs away. hehe. okay, the end."

It started off as just her joking around about what I enjoyed doing (sound and lighting in shows) (shes a dancer) but as it progressed it became less of a joke and more of a targeted attack on me. I am a very calm person and it takes a long time for someone to get to me but after about 6 months of this I snapped and retaliated by telling her exactly what I thought of her. However since this moment I have reported it and the school did nothing but tell me to get on with it. It is getting to a point now where I dont want to carry on because she has made me believe I really am that bad at something.

287,25 years old and still bullied (LONG),11,dfjzjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dfjzjx/25_years_old_and_still_bullied_long/,6,1570669412.0,"I have gotten bullied all my life. I definitely handle it much better now than I used to. I am 25 years old and I get bullied at work by a coworker. We will call her Jabba The Hutt. She hated me from day 1 of me starting at this company. I can see it in her face and yet she was so fake to me. Smiley, would tell me things about her day/life, tell me I was doing such a good job when she was training me in my position. The first time I confirmed she didn't like me was when I was about 2 weeks into the job. I work in a call center and I was at her desk being trained by Jabba The Hutt and she had checked her Facebook quick. She had left her messenger up and she was conversing about me with another coworker in the department on messenger. We will call that coworker, Dee. Dee and Jabba were saying that I am always on my phone (which wasn't necessarily true. During down time I did check my phone. My friend at the time was going through a lot in life and I was just checking up on him and such. But I did do my job and I wasn't constantly on my phone the way they made it seem). Jabba also told Dee that I was annoying and that one of our other coworkers went to my supervisor about me already for the phone stuff. I felt sick to my stomach and was kind of unsure how to approach it, because I just started at this job. I didn't want it to start off with my whole department hating me already. So, after seeing all that right in my face, I decided to go to my supervisor about it. I was mostly upset at the fact that if they had a problem, they didn't confront me at all. I had no idea anything was wrong. I just had a feeling that turned out to be true. Anyway, I told my supervisor what I saw and he said that he would definitely take care of it. He called Jabba and Dee into his office at separate times. When Jabba came out of the office, she told me that it wasn't what I thought it was and that it wasn't meant to sound the way it did. When Dee came out of the office, she apologized to me. I was super nice and understanding to both of them on the situation. Figured, alright, we got off on the wrong start, lets try again. Well, the bullying continued with Jabba. Dee and I actually got along well, but when Jabba saw that, she would pull Dee back into believing things about me that weren't true so Dee wouldn't like me again. Jabba told Dee that I was trying to steal her job even though I apparently did absolutely nothing, work wise, every day (which isn't true. I did my job, every day and I took on more if I was allowed.), Jabba would squeal on me to management about my clothes. It is business casual here, but we are allowed leggings. I had worn a pair of leggings that had criss-cross slits at the ankle. She claimed I was showing too much skin (even though there are people that are wearing mini skirts here and tight dresses). She convinced Dee that I was pretty much out to get her and take her position which was farthest from the truth. I actually really liked Dee when we did have our heart to hearts. She was cool and we had a lot in common, but Jabba kept her death grip tight on Dee and manipulated her mind about me. Jabba would go to other people in other departments about me too. Once, I had music playing and it wasn't loud at all. Instead of confronting me to turn it down, she went to our supervisor about it. He asked me to turn it down and I told him it wasn't even loud. If I turn it down anymore, I might as well turn it off. He came over and listened to where I had the volume and he said he can barely hear it. I found out she was the one who told on me, because my supervisor told me it was her. He was aware of her bullying with me so when I had questioned him who told, he ended up telling me. He told me to keep my music on and to not worry. That he knows its not loud. Then Jabba proceeded to go to other departments and complain about me. She told coworkers I was blaring my music so loud and she couldn't concentrate on her work. That I was stupid and she is going to human resources about me, because she went to our supervisor and nothing was done. Yet, there is this dude in our call center that BLARES pop music and she would always talk to me about how she doesn't mind it, its just what he does. But I have my music super low and she has something to complain about. Not to mention, just the day before, she was talking so sweetly to me. She also analyzed EVERYTHING I did. If I didn't do it exactly the way she taught me, it was wrong. If I was gone from my desk for more than 10 minutes, she was in my face asking me where I was that whole time. As if its her business. I ended up finding out from Dee that her and Jabba had a falling out. Dee ended up spilling things out to me about Jabba. Apparently, Jabba would creep on my Facebook almost every day, and make fun of the stuff I had on there. My pictures, where I worked in the past. My Facebook is pretty private and I had Dee on my Facebook, but not Jabba so I assume Dee showed her my stuff when Jabba asked and apparently she would just search my name and make a mission to criticize my page. She said that I was ""fucked up"" for getting a Crucio tattoo on my wrist, because it is one of the unforgiveable curses from Harry Potter. That a good person wouldn't get something like that on them. She made fun of all my tattoo's actually. Jabba would make fun of my piercings (I have 2 in my nose, a septum ring, and labret pierced). Yet, she told a different coworker, who has tons of tattoos and piercings, that she loved them on her! She would be sweet to my face, but do this shit behind my back. I knew she didn't like me though, because it was obvious fakeness. You could tell, plus people would come and tell me the things she would do. And then, of course, all the stuff that Dee ended up spilling to me. Dee was pregnant for my first 6 months at my job and she ended up quitting. I ended up finding out why. Dee told me that Jabba and her working talking badly about me at work over the works messenger. The one day, Dee was called into the office. When she entered the office, they sat her down and showed her the messages they received from ""a concerned party."" It was the messages Dee and Jabba were sending back and forth about me, but somehow Jabba's responses were taken out and the conversation was fixed to look like Dee was the one instigating everything that was said. Management and human resources wrote Dee up and took away her profit sharing. When Dee came into work the next day, Jabba immediately sent her a message bashing me. Dee told her that she isn't interested in doing this anymore and stopped responding to Jabba. Jabba ended up coming over to Dee's desk and asking her if she got written up too. Dee said, ""Yeah, did you?"" And Jabba then proceeded to tell Dee that I must have saw the messages somehow and ran to management about them. Dee believed her at the time and she quit the next day because of it. Dee ended up finding out that Jabba was the one that sent those messages to management and reported her as ""a concerned party"", but Jabba blamed me. I had no idea that this all even happened until Dee told me. Keep in mind, Jabba is a 35-36 year old female. I felt like I was in high school. Jabba was constantly getting people against me and making me uncomfortable at work. She oddly even invited me to her birthday dinner with coworkers and I went, but later learned from Dee that she only invited me because she felt obligated to. When Dee found out that Jabba lied about me and lied about EVERYTHING, she apologized immensely to me and sent me EVERYTHING she had that her and Jabba talked about and shared with each other about me, and others they bashed in the department. There was tons of screen shots of Jabba calling me a spoiled little shithead, a cunt, etc. Plus, she was spreading other coworkers business around when they would confide in her about their personal things. I printed it all out and took it to management. Unfortunately, Jabba never got fired. They just kicked her out of our department, and moved her to a different one. I still have to deal with her on work related things when she has to transfer calls to me, and I still have to see her every day. Smiling and fake! She got to keep her good title at work, which I felt should have been taken from her, and she got to keep her pay, and hours that she had too. I was so angry when I found out she wasn't fired for her bullying. Instead she got everything she wanted. She didn't want to be in our department anyway, and she finally got out, even though it was under different circumstances. She still got what she wanted. I refuse to be nice to her or fake. I am very short and to the point when she transfers calls to me and she is still fake af to me! I know she doesn't like me and I know she knows I don't like her. If I ever see her outside of work, I will be confronting her."

I just found this sub today and I’m so glad I did. I’ve been looking for a place like this on the internet for years and I feel like I found it :) I’ve been reading a couple of the top posts here and I just feel like I need to rant about how much bullying has affected my life. I won’t tell my full on sob story because it’s so complex, but just enough to get my point across I guess? 

I was bullied from grades 4 to 10 mostly (about ages 10-16). I was a fat kid, had a weird spelling of my name, was quiet and never stood up for myself so I was the perfect target. I’m also bisexual so that took a part of the bullying from about ages 13+ when people my age became aware of other sexualities and I was labeled a “dyke” because of the way I dressed and acted 

The bullying was almost never physical, I would maybe get the occasional shove. It was majority of the type verbal and emotional. It started off just being whispered side comments that I could just ignore as a kid but then it became so much worse. As we all became teenagers, I became aware of my body type and that I was ugly according to society. Other kids noticed too. 

They developed a nickname for me: “Big Mama.” They would draw stupid pictures of what I looked like to them and leave it on my desk, scream it in the hallways so everyone looked at me. At one point in my 8th grade English class, we were reading a book and one of the character’s nicknames were “Big Mama.” You can imagine what happened there 

(TW: depression, self harm) I developed really bad depression at a young age, and I still suffer from it. I have gone to therapy, gone to mental health emergency rooms, taken medication. Nothing helps. I used to self harm for years and only recently stopped, I’ve been clean for 3 years. I have thought countless times about taking my own life 

At 16, I enrolled in a program at my school where for half the day I was at a different school learning a vocational trade. So for half the day I didn’t have to face those people, it was a relief. That’s probably the only reason the bullying stopped, because I was barely at school in the first place 

I’m 19 now. I graduated and started my first year of college recently. I have yet to be bullied (thank god) but I’m paranoid, I feel like everyone is still making fun of me. I feel like my 13 year old self. My self confidence is shattered, it pretty much has never existed. Bullying has left me with so many traumatic experiences.

Any help would be appreciated"

Just admit you like guys, it's ok. 

Of course I don't actually answer but he's not someone I can easily avoid. I know some of his weaknesses so I can definitely fire back. It gets him upset and puts him back in his place real quick. I just don't mention it often bc I don't care and know he'll crumble. Maybe I should fire back more. See how he likes it."

But I wanna know why I get bullied a lot by strangers. One time this year as I was getting out of the elevator door. This random guy made eye contact with me and as I was gonna leave the elevator. He ran up to me as soon as I was about to step out and blocked me from leaving. So since am skinny I just squeezed past him. Another time when I was grocery shopping and getting my stuff out of the cart. This random guy come and tryd to take my cart while my stuff was in the cart. I told him my stuff is in the cart and he kept on going. So as he was walking away with my cart I took the remaining bags away. We were outside and there were plenty of carts. Another time in a mall restaurant were ive been multiple time and I wanted a to get a to go bag. I asked the cashier and then he ignored me. I waited 3 minutes and asked him again. This time he slammed the to go bag and looked me directly in the eye. I just took it and left. The guy was smaller then me. So its not just big guys being mean to me. BTW am skinny, 5,9 and wear glasses. So maybe I look like a easy target. There have been more encounters but there to long to list.  Am not making any of this stuff up. BTW this is my throwaway account. Wanna know how I can deal with random strangers picking on me. And maybe why they are doing it? Going outside is starting to scare me."

Worst thing I ever got told was “take off your glasses cuz we want to laugh. You look like a dog without them”. And that stuck with me for many years. I just got my confidence back a year back and I finally love myself and think I’m pretty. And others think so too. I worked really hard on myself and groomed and take care of myself. I was working for a thesis film and yesterday there was this guy who was one of the actors and he was flirting. I made it clear I wasn’t interested and he proceeded  to say “you shouldn’t take your glasses off. It’ll scare people” and when I said “are you trying to say I look bad without them” he said “atleast I’m being honest”. It doesn’t bother me cuz I won’t think of myself differently because of what he said but I can’t help but to have flashbacks of school.

296,I used to bully a girl and I want to apologize to her but...,12,cih2ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cih2ni/i_used_to_bully_a_girl_and_i_want_to_apologize_to/,9,1564260305.0,"I’m 15 year old girl. I go to a church every Sunday, where I met lots of friends. About 5(?) years ago, there used to be a girl who I was mean to. Let’s just call her J. She never did anything wrong to me, but I just hated her. I thought she was annoying and ugly, and I kept being rude and mean to her. 

Like for example, in the past, us kids liked to jump on a trampoline, but the church had a rule where only a certain amount of people could be on it at once. We didn’t care about the rule, and all of us except J got on the trampoline. We ignored her, and whenever she tried to get on the trampoline, we’d tell her that she isn’t allowed to get on since there’s too many people. Or if she actually got on, we’d all just get off and go somewhere else and laugh at her.

I also told another friend of mine to ignore her and not to play with her. Whenever J sat near me, I’d move seats or push myself further away from her. I’d also sometimes pretend that I couldn’t hear her talking, or like I couldn’t see her. Whenever we played with her (which was very rare), we would all be on the “good” team, and she was on the “bad” team with nobody else.

Her family had been members of the church for a long time, but then one day, she got into an accident in our church. She slipped and her front teeth (adult teeth by the way) got knocked out. I was not there on that day, but apparently her family blamed my friend, let’s call him Y. Y was standing behind J before she slipped, so they accused Y of pushing her. Of course, I was angry, because at that time, I still disliked J. I was mad at her family for blaming my friend Y who I trusted more than J. I still don’t think Y actually pushed her, I think it was an accident because it was a rainy day, and she was running.

But I started hating her more. The other kids also hated her more, saying that her family were liars and more rude stuff. In the end, they stopped coming to the church.

I want to apologize to her for everything. 
A little while after she left, I realized that I was bullying her. I want to see her again and tell her that I’m sorry for being such an asshole to her.

The other kids still don’t like her. Whenever her name is mentioned, they all start talking badly about her again, and saying that “we should get her to come back, and then beat her.” But I feel really guilty. I want to tell her that I’m sorry. 

One day, by luck, I somehow saw her at the zoo. I knew it was her instantly, even though I hadn’t seen her in years. I wanted to go up to her and talk to her, and apologize, but I just.. couldn’t. I was scared. She looked so happy, surrounded by her new friends, and I didn’t want to remind her of me. I just froze, and I couldn’t say anything to her. I didn’t want her to remember anything about me. So I left. 

I still feel annoyed at myself. I should’ve talked to her that day. It shouldn’t be that hard, to just say the words “I’m sorry”! I feel terrible, because I know that I missed my chance to talk to her. 

I have literally no way to contact her. I don’t know where she lives, or if she has any social media. I still feel really bad, but what should I do?? I don’t know what to do now. Also, I’m scared that even if I meet her someday, and somehow manage to apologize, that she’ll still hate me. Of course I know that it would be really unlikely for her to just suddenly become friendly with me again, but I’m still scared. I’m scared that she won’t forgive me. 

I want to find her and apologize, but I’m also scared to look for her, in case she wanted to forget about me. I don’t want to remind her about the bad things I did to her, but I also want to let her know that it was all my fault. I don’t know what to do anymore, like should I try to find her to tell her I’m sorry? Or should I just hope that she’s having a good life and that she’s happier without remembering about me? 

Thank you to anyone who read all that. 
Please give me some advice. 
I just had to get that all out of my chest."

The reason, BULLYING.  My youngest son is highly function Autistic.  He also is a wrestler.
The BULLYING was so bad it ended up in court.  I tried to talk to the parents of the boy.  They apparently thought it was ok for heir son to physically assault my son.  Their son would see my son down at the peer fishing.  He would let tap my son on the shoulder.  My son would turn around, the boy would punch my son in the face.  As a wrestler, my son in turn would restrain the boy.  

It was just getting worse.  In court the boy told the judge, he assaulted n stocked my son, because he is different.  I was granted a harassment order. However, it didn't stop.  I needed to leave.  It took a year to sell my little home 😭.  

I was able to do a contract for deed on another home.  The neighborhood is amazing.  

With a C/D there is a balloon payment that needs to be paid.  Sadly, because my credit score isn't high enough.  I have never missed a payment, I pay my own homeowners insurance, and taxes.  However, I will loose my house.

I've tried everything 😭.  The one thing that  is the biggest problem is my student loans.  I'm on a pay as you earn program.  I do not earn much so my payment is zero.  However, mortgage companies have to use 1% of your balance.  Well 1% of 79,000, is a lot. 

I just feel defeated.  I could be homeless, because of a dang credit score."
300,Coworker Sabotage,11,bidfbf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bidfbf/coworker_sabotage/,5,1556500056.0,"I recently worked at an accounting firm where another employee gave me inaccurate and misleading advice in order to sabotage my work performance and consistently made belittling comments. This workplace harassment became so unbearable for me that I quit the day that I found another job. My first post is a description of the first time that I believe this employee sabotaged my performance.

&#x200B;

The first instance in which I believe he gave me intentionally misleading advice took place on my second day, which was a Tuesday, at the firm. I asked him how long I should take to complete an individual tax return. He said two hours. That Friday, my boss came in and asked me how long I was taking on each tax return. I said that I was taking two hours, but I was completing them in about forty-five minutes. I also told him that I was using the additional hour and fifteen minutes to review those returns multiple times. My boss then asked me how long it took me to a complete a single review of an already completed tax return. I told him that it took me about five to ten minutes. This would bring the average time it took me to complete a tax return to between fifty and fifty-five minutes. My boss told me that I should only review each tax return once. This suggests that the average time it should have taken me to complete a tax return was fifty to fifty-five minutes. The aforementioned coworker advised me to take nearly twice as long as what my boss implied I should take to complete a tax return. My boss actually had this conversation with me in front of this coworker of mine. My boss was actually standing in the doorway to the office that myself and my coworker shared. This put him closer to my coworker than he was to me because my coworker was sitting at his desk and his desk is closer to the doorway that my desk is. He was also speaking at a typical conversational level. My boss was also not facing myself or my coworker. My boss also did not have his back to the other employee. He was facing the wall in between us. Therefore, it is highly unlikely that my coworker could not hear what my boss was saying. My coworker did not tell my boss that I was operating under the advice that he had given me to take two hours to complete a return. I found out later that my coworker was taking about an hour to complete each return. The amount of time he took to complete a return combined with the fact that he did not interject to tell my boss that he had advised me to take two hours on each return has led me to believe that he was intentionally sabotaging my work. Providing me with this advice also had no impact on his output or the output of any other employees other than myself. It only reduced my total output and therefore, reduced the firm's total output. This suggests that this employee was willing to sacrifice the overall output and success of the firm, in order to increase the percentage of output of the firm that he was responsible for. I found this behavior to be extremely unscrupulous.

&#x200B;

My boss had also sent an email to all the employees at my firm prior to when I started outlining my academic and professional accomplishments. I had graduated from college with Latin honors. This other employee had not graduated with honors. I believe that the employee who had been bullying me at this firm did so because he found my academic accomplishments threatening. The other employees were kind to me. My boss was also kind to me, but he consistently made inappropriate comments about my appearance. There were good things about working at this firm. My boss also gave me positive feedback and praise about my abilities and the work that I turned in. However, towards the end of my time at this firm all I could think about were the negative aspects of working there, so I quit.

&#x200B;

I have spoken with some of my close relatives and friends about what I went through at this firm. They all said that they were not surprised because I can be a little meek and timid. I know now that I was not completely blameless in all this. I need to stand up for myself in the future, or at least point out when other employees are acting maliciously.

&#x200B;

Any advice, feedback, or stories from those who have been in similar situations is appreciated!"
301,"I want to share the story about encountering my middle and high school bully now that I’m 2 years out of high school and successful. Also, my word of advice to any and all being bullied now.",12,bhs37h,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bhs37h/i_want_to_share_the_story_about_encountering_my/,8,1556345154.0,"This is long, I don’t expect many to read. But bullying is something that i do not stand for and I feel that people should hear stories about it to see the levels. 


In middle school I did not hit my growth spurt so I was very stubby and had horrible acne. These two people who literally drove me to the point of depression always called me a fat ass, pizza face, four-eyes. They’d call me things that were even worse like faggot, I wasn’t gay but that is a HORRIBLE thing to call someone. They’d say things about my dad who left me, things about my mom. I’d get smacked around in the hallways and have my books spit in. Just downright disgusting things that have actually scarred me for life in a way. The final straw that actually was the catalyst for the change was a really big fight that happened between the two kids in the hallway and me. I tried to stand my ground but they just completely destroyed me. They did such dirty shit like kick me in my balls, stomp on my head and spit on me. One of them actually said to me that if they had something to kill me with they would actually do it. After that both kids were expelled and I was placed into a recovery system in my school that allows children that are bullied to learn in a non-toxic environment with built in therapy sessions to talk about things that we couldn’t to others.

So I fast forward to now. I’m 2 years out of high school. 6’0”, 245 pounds of pure muscle. I bodybuild and lift as a sport and compete in junior Olympic lifting competitions. To this day, I still look in the mirror and I just see a fat kid with a black eye. Nothing is ever going to change that. I’m also in the army as a combat engineer and going to college and I have to say I couldn’t be living a better life.

 I saw the one kid who told me if he could kill me he would do it - the actual leader of the pack at my local gas station while getting gas for my bike. As I’m sitting there on the bike, He approached me and said “hey man, do you remember me?” I said to him “ahh, I don’t think so man. What’s your name?” He told me his name and my stomach dropped to my feet and I got a cold chill running down my spine. I gave him a pretty hard gaze as if someone said my mother died. 

“How’ve you been? You look a lot better since the last time I saw you.” He’s referring to the last year he was in my school which was 9th grade, and he still was a dickhead to me but not as bad. 

I put the kickstand down and turned the bike off. I got up and said to him (as best as I could remember) “yeah. I remember you, and all of the bullshit you put me through. Hows your fucking life? Did anyone scar you to the point where you get filled with rage when anyone says the word ‘fat’ around you? Do you still have scars on your arms from the times you clawed me and stabbed me with pencils? Do you think for one fucking second I don’t remember that?”
He looked at me completely embarrassed and now spiteful for stirring up bad memories. He said back to me “That was so long ago, You haven’t let it go? We were kids.”

That immediately got my blood boiling even further than it was. I then proceeded to say (to the best of my knowledge): “You think it’s okay now because we were kids back then. Let me ask you, what is it that you do nowadays?” He told me how he works for a gas company. I then told him “Yeah, you definitely amounted to something. Im glad you work a 9-5 in a bullshit construction company because honestly, I predicted by this time you’d be dead from heroine or in jail.”
He looked at me and said “Is that seriously necessary? Can’t we be men about this?”
I snapped back at him “MEN?! You wanna be men about this? Alright then, I’m not holding back anymore. If you want to settle this business let’s settle it right here where there isn’t any teachers to stop us.”

He CLEARLY wanted no parts of it. Shuddering now because he’s very close to getting vengeance and rancor spit right back in his ugly face. He said to me “You don’t have to like me or respect me. I just wanted to come and apologize.” 

I threw my hands in the air, turned around, got on my bike and turned it on. 

“You have absolutely no business coming around me. I suggest you do the right thing and get lost before I embarrass you in front of this busy gas station. Fuck you and fuck your apology.”

His head fell and he spun around real slowly then walked back to his piece of shit Ford pickup with dents and rust all up in it. I saw a tear fall from his eye as he walked away, that didn’t mean shit to me considering the entire time we had the altercation I was bawling my eyes out in a fit of rage. I dropped my gear and sped off as fast as I could have. And that was the end of that. 

My conclusion was: he didn’t expect to see a kid he tormented to be so successful, and he wanted to make amends just to clear the karma and not have that embarrassment hanging over his head that a kid he destroyed was now a higher power than him. 

Here’s my advice to all of you out there.

STAY. STRONG. DONT. QUIT. 
You all are amazing people and that’s why bullies want to fuck with you so much. They see the faults that they have inside of you and they want you to never succeed. One day, you will rise above any and all people who have trampled on your morale and killed your confidence. You all are badasses with incredible lives ahead of you. Go fight for your country, protect the law, save a life and pump some iron. Don’t let these people bring you down because YOU. ARE. A. BEAST. Whatever people give you shit for, you better take it as a compliment because clearly you have something they don’t and they want it. They want your ass, they want your life. Do whatever you can to refuse that from happening and NEVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU DIFFERENT."
302,Dont Make Excuses for Bullies,10,bf4947,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bf4947/dont_make_excuses_for_bullies/,12,1555736366.0,"Have heard way too many advice from others that bullies probably are ""suffering"" deep inside too and that I should change my perspective and fking empathize with that bullshit.

Since when was it so pitiful for then to amplify their messed up thoughts into actions on other TOTALLY INNOCENT victims, who did absolutely nothing wrong, going to get their education and living their own lives, only to be completely fked over by a person ""suffering"" so much that she needs to take it out on others to make her feel better abt herself.

To be more specific, the intensity and frequency of bullying skyrockets to the point where suicide is a common ""headline"" which gets forgetten and buried after two days. And the bullies supposedly the ones also ""suffering"" are somewhere giggling their asses off while putting on a fake ""sorry"" face. an completely innocent, hopeful child just gone like that. all because people decide to vent their ""sufferings""; and here they say that suicide is selfish. 

It is the bullies themselves who are alive and breathing. Even worse when they claim that they regret what they did and are overwrought with guilt, because they better damn well know that they are supposed to be the one dead. They owe their lives to the ones buried in their graves, trapped in a dark place and still wondering what they did wrong to deserve so much hate.

And I havent even vouch for those victims still struggling to get by each day, extreme desolation, fear from the trauma that those bullies gave. See, its something that will never go away. Others say that these victims are just psychologically weak and cant handle a little ""challenge"" from life, but who made them god to decide that the fear and anxiety paralyzed? 

These bullies use the excuse of being ""blinded"" by their own circumstances to torment any other innocent being that doesnt even look their way, act like their all repentent and eaten alive by their guilt. No, you cannot erase the trauma, you cannot raise the dead."
303,Anyone else full of moral outrage about high school 30 years later?,12,bcdqin,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bcdqin/anyone_else_full_of_moral_outrage_about_high/,3,1555105511.0,"My stepfather from 2 on cycled through ridiculing me, ignoring me, threatening me and violently attacking me. It turned me into an extremely shy person. In high school it was mostly like I just wasn't there. I hardly talked and no one really gave a damn. I've never even been invited to any high school reunion and I live still right in the same town. And I guess what's the point? I didn't know anyone really anyway.

I was big and actually very athletic. So other than being occasionally made fun of I wasn't really bullied too much. I never got to play organized sports. I tried out for the tennis team and the coach pretended I wasn't there. I asked him if he wanted me to do anything and he said, ""Did I ask you to do anything? Then I must not want you to do anything."" Then he walked away and went back to ignoring me. And no one else cared. Certainly not my parents. And no one else. 

There were a lot of adults who did things like this. My outrage is mostly directed there and towards my stepfather. But it still just really bothers me that I was just ignored by other students and never had friends. It's almost like I was beaten to a pulp and laying on a sidewalk unable to walk and everyone just stepped over me. For my entire childhood/youth. 

But I would not have guessed that 30 years later it would still bother me so much. By the way, I'm happily married. Have some close friends now. Have a good job. Two young children. Lots of hobbies. Not particularly shy. 

And it still REALLY bothers me. I want justice. 30 years later I'm still so angry about how I was treated."

305,I scared off a bunch of kids who bullied a homeless man.... and ditched my date too,11,b7mhmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b7mhmo/i_scared_off_a_bunch_of_kids_who_bullied_a/,5,1554058149.0,"I was on a date with some guy I met while I was at work, I served him as a customer and he asked me upfront for a date (he was a regular) I accepted .....

So here we were walking about chatting away about movies and music while walking to the bar.

As I turned a corner I noticed a group of young boys running about being hooligans, but I shrugged and thought boys will be boys I guess, I kept an eye on them as I was walking because I can be nosey sometimes I was curious of what they were up to, but then a homeless man caught my eye he was sitting outside a shop that’s been closed for years just taking a nap he had his cap over his face to keep the sun out his eyes, if I have some change left to spare or a chocolate bar I always hand it over to the homeless.
But since he was sleeping I didn’t want to disturb him as I thought he’s probably catching some Z’s he must of slept rough last night.

As we were getting close to the bar I heard a voice saying “kick him in the balls..... just do it!” And next thing I heard a loud groan as you’d hear from any man taking a beating to his knackers!

I turned around to see those boys started picking on the poor homeless man they were pulling his sleeping bag from under him throwing things about out of his backpack and one of them yanked his hat hovering it over a cigarette lighter trying to burn it!

I couldn’t stand to watch this anymore! I grabbed my date by the arm and said “come on babe! We need to help him!” He turned around and saw the homeless man getting picked on he never even noticed until I told him....

He just started laughing! “Haha haha! I’m not helping that tramp!..... that’s kinda funny!” 

I quickly let go of my date as we were linking arms, gave him daggers! 

I quickly ran over by myself yanked the hat off one of the boys and knocked the lighter out of his hands I threw it back to the homeless man.... I quickly thought of how to scare off these little shits since they were younger than me I put the boy close by in a head lock! (I wasn’t strangling him) 

The rest of the boys looked in shock like a girl dressed to the nines managed to get a good grip of one of the little shits...

* if you check my profile and read my pro revenge called Dads are the best*

I thought of what my Dad did for me when a group of boys bullied me!

I got a good grip on the boys hoodie close to his neck and just slammed him up against a wall making sure he didn’t move .... 

“Listen you little shit stain and listen good because next time I see you and your “boyfriends” again picking on an innocent man....(I got close to his face) I’LL KILL YOU!” 

I had very long nails at the time with my free hand I run my long index finger nail along his face getting close to his eyes..... then I thought of something that really scared him.....

“Oh you got your mother’s eyes....(don’t even know his mum).... how would she feel that her little boy is bullying a poor helpless man? I KNOW she didn’t raise you this way!” 

And just like that he was shaking in his Nike trainers and just shook his head....

And since I didn’t want the public thinking I was about to attack a minor I let the boy go so he could breath as I could sense a panic attack coming from him 

Then he and his little shits fan club just ran away! 

My date stayed and watched the whole scene he looked at me and said damn! That was awesome... never been so damn attracted to you! 

I just ignored my date and helped the homeless man pick up his things and asked him if he was alright he thanked me for helping him out and for saving his hat from getting burned as it belonged to his dad ... I picked up his hat and put some money in there along with a chocolate bar and smiled.

He pointed over at my date and said...”you should get back to your boyfriend, you’d make a lovely couple!” 

I looked back at my date and said “he’s not my boyfriend and after today he never will be!” 

I just flipped my date the bird and shouted “go fuck yourself with a cactus you heartless (C U Next Tuesday )” 

The homeless man just laughed so hard he cried 

I looked at the time on my phone and thought well since my dates come to an end so fast I should make my way home... I asked the man if he wanted a coffee on me but he said no thanks as it was summer and said I did enough for him today ....

I shook his hand and told him to have a good day and headed home...

I told my Dad what went down and he was just so proud of how I take after him!

306,How I made my bully look like a coward,11,b1cs73,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b1cs73/how_i_made_my_bully_look_like_a_coward/,1,1552670989.0,"(I'm on mobile so sorry in advance for any mistakes) So let's start at the beginning this story. takes place when I was 15 and had just moved to a different town and I started a new school, I had been having suicidal thoughts but I told my parents and we got through it together. So on my first couple of weeks at this new school I had made a new friend let's call him Tom, so Tom was an alright guy and we became really close so I opened up to him about my suicidal issues and we move on. A couple days later I hear him talking to some girls and he was telling them about my issues I walked over to him and asked what the f*** he was doing and he said he was bringing awareness to suicide. Slowly Tom becomes more aggressive towards me so naturally we drifted apart. No my brother is a year older than me and he is the tallest person in my family (most people in my family are 6ft or taller) but he is a big softy and swears against violence so he couldn't help. Now after school one day while I was waiting for my bus and Tom walks up to me and my brother and my brothers friend (were all into nerdy stuff like yughio) while  we're looking at the yughio cards, but then Tom snatches a card and puts it in his pocket no we've gathered attention people start shouting fight so we give em what they asked for. First Tom goes for a punch but I grab him by the front of his collar and lifted him up and punched him in the face while holding him (btw Tom is rly short) and shout at him ""GIVE IT BACK YOU PR**K"" quickly he grabs it out of his pocket and drops it when suddenly my brother pulls me away but I resist and Tom still gets away with a bleeding lip nose and black eye all for the price of a blue eyes white dragon (the yughio card) and to this day he still gets made fun of.

Present day I'm a healthy 21 year old man who no longer gets bullied no longer have suicidal thoughts and I have a pretty good house that I live in with my lovely gf "

I kind of found at the start teachers had sympathy but when it kept happening despite their interventions I was treated like the one with the problem.  I mean my social skills suck but I was never deliberately mean to anyone.  

It was like they had this ""can't you just try to get on with other people"" and I'm thinking ""no, no I really can't when the other people are going out of their way to be cruel to me,"".  I'd have been happy to be left alone if people don't like me but that's never good enough for bullies.

Is it just human nature to victim blame?"
308,Thoughts on Long-Term Coping with Bullying Aftermath?,11,a6kdb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/a6kdb3/thoughts_on_longterm_coping_with_bullying/,15,1544947895.0,"Okay, so sharing this is not easy as I will highlight for several reasons but I hope it is somewhat coherent. Just let me know if you have some advise on the following matter. 

From age 9 to 15 I was bullied and excluded quite severely at school. It never got physical but the degree of social exclusion and verbal warfare was enough to make my life into a virtual hell for that time. I had no friends that helped me, and the once I called ""friends"" at the time joined the name-calling. Around age 15, I ran away from home and when I returned I did two runs of therapy. It helped at the time to make me feel less bad. So around age 17, I still spent time with the same ""friends"", but had started to socially exclude myself more and more. I started therapy again and this made me feel better again. I graduated high school and started to study.

I had always been interested into the human mind, long before I got bullied, and had decided to educate myself into forensic psychology for further specialisation into detective work. During my study I decided against it because I view myself as a rather soft person and I prefer to help those in need. As such, my career path is currently in behavioural science and clinical psychology. I am willing to work hard and have discovered I am actually quite good what I do. I am at the top of my classes and will probably graduate university cum laude next July. I truly believe it is my purpose to help others in this world, which (according to others) I do very well. 

The strange part of this is that still something is not right. Talking to others is not really a problem for me, and I can even initiate and maintain friendships to some degree. Yet, deep connections always seem to be lacking which seems to be a problem with how I pick around me or something. Two of my current friends are very nice but with rare contact, one of them I talk to very often but she is emotionally distal, and one other is emotionally unpredictable and has grown increasingly hostile over the past months. Besides that, I maintain a lot of superficial contacts, mainly from my study. When I tell people I have had and still have these problems, they are always surprised as it is not exactly noticeable. 

I never was much of an extraverted person, but my social outgoing-ness is basically non-existent unless it is with people I know well. I tend to be a careful listener and an even more so a careful talker. Other people usually say I am very modest,  altruistic in helping others, and very empathetic. I view myself as generally capable and clever, but not especially accomplished or anything. I don't believe others can or will like or love me for who I am, perhaps only because of my possession or particular talents. Perhaps that has resulted in that I am 21 and have never had a romantic relationship of any kind. Sometimes I would like to, but I always reason against it. Other times, I simply do not feel like I am capable of connecting at all. 

So, most of the problems I have, revolve around being lonely despite having others around, and being quite inhibited in my social life because of ""being me"". I have recently picked up therapy (currently on the waiting-list after another semi-successful cognitive-behavioural treatment) because I still have the idea that something is very wrong. However, I do not know exactly what I have to do with this all. I am a psych student myself so I know a fair share about psychopathology and treatment but the nature of my education only makes it possible to treat others; my education is not an advantage when dealing with this. I can tell you that there is a very big stigma regarding 'psychologists with mental problems' which makes it even more difficult to be open about it. 

I was wondering if others maybe can share some advise on how to tackle this because I am simply not able to find a way out of this at all. I will probably manage my occupation and education easily, but in social terms I feel that there is still a lot of damage. In any case, thanks for reading and look forward to your thoughts :)"

In 9th grade there were 2 lunch periods but most of us had the same one so we were eating lunch together in the 9th grade.  I remember one time we went up the street to the park on our lunch break, and another time had a wrestling match outside.  I thought these guys were my friends and then I go to sit with them one day and they all get up and go to another table.  Obviously it was all planned out.  I still don't know what I did to deserve that.  So the rest of the school year I ate lunch in the toilet stall or I walked home only to walk right back.  "

Year 4 

I had just switched schools due to my fathers work, and had gained a bit of extra weight. The first day i went i remember feeling singled out due to my weight, no one had said anything yet....

The following weeks included me walking around the school yard looking at the floor and doing poetry in my head and occasionally writing it down (I still have the poetry with me today). But what i like to call ""Doomsday"" happened. I started to talk to people at my table but when i went out for lunch a boy named Josh came up to me ""why are you even to talking to this pig"" the three girls i was with shrugged and walked away. From then on i was deemed as an outcast. i had people constantly calling me many names such as fat, pig, obese etc but them the physical abuse started. One day a person that i didn't even know, came up to me and punched me in the balls. I rolled on the ground crying and he started to laugh his ass off. At the end of lunch i was limping into class and a teacher asked me what happened i said nothing. From then on the school tried to force into making friends but no one actually meant what they said, i was put in counselling by the school which didn't help and when i came home as was always depressed. No one had my back, No one stood up for me i was helpless. I eventually had to be pulled out of that school because i was starting to develop suicidal thoughts. Now in grade 9 i maked it my destiny to sort out any dickhead bully who thinks they are the shit"

313,I was bullied as a kid and I almost caused a tragedy at school,12,7ujozy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/7ujozy/i_was_bullied_as_a_kid_and_i_almost_caused_a/,1,1517529623.0,"Hey everyone,

Formerly bullied guy here. I'm 35 years old and I got my life in order now, but as a teenager, I was bullied pretty viciously for two years. Imagine a tall, but really skinny and physically weak dude (didn't do any sports as a kid) that is extremely insecure and you have the perfect victim for bullies.

That was me. I was bullied both verbally and physically by those classmates who were much stronger than me. The worst was physical class. Fuck I was bad at it. I sucked at all those sports and I was repeatedly humiliated by those bullies. And what was I gonna do against them anyway? They could whoop my ass with one hand if they wanted to.

After months and months of bullying, I grew so desperate that I almost did the unthinkable. I wasn't gonna harm myself though. Oh no, I wasn't gonna give those pricks *that* satisfaction. I was so angry and full of hate I planned to do something else.

It was on a misty friday morning in october, after having been bullied the year before and up to that point, that I got up earlier than my mom and my sister. I was about 16 years old I think. Before leaving to school, I quietly grabbed my sister's field hockey stick. You know, one of those metallic sticks with a wooden shell around it. I was planning to bring that shit to school... and John-John Dohmen the fucking shit out of those bullies. I was planning to really beat them to a bloody pulp so angry I was.

As I left the apartment building we lived in, walking to school I looked at that fucking stick in my hand and I thought ""Damn man... what the fuck are you doing? You're insane! You're gonna kill those guys and end up in jail... you can't do that!""

I went back home, put the stick back and went to school, and just kept soaking up the bullying till at the end of the school year, I switched schools.

Tot his day, I still shudder at the idea of what damage I would have done if I actually went through with the hockey stick thing. Don't get me wrong, I still hated my bullies. And being the horribly rancorous person I am, I never forgave them. 

As a matter of fact, I ran into one of those pricks a year ago. Now you have to know that since my early twenties, I've been doing a lot of sports, lifted weights and did martial arts and now I'm a fairly muscular (not bodybuilder-huge though, but still strong looking), tall dude who is much more confident. He recognized me and I could see he was visibly shaken that I was no longer that scrawny weakling while he had become out of shape. He awkwardly asked how I was doing, as if he hoped I didn't remember his bullying, and I simply told him I'm doing better as an adult than I was as a teenager. He gave me a nervous chuckle. He was visibly intimidated and (call me petty and un-nice) this was one of the most satisfying feelings I ever had.

Anyway, this is just to tell you that, as cliche as it may sound, bullying eventually stops. But if you really want me advice, and this will sound cliche as fuck too: if your kid is being bullied, have him study a martial art in a club. Not so that he can learn to beat the shit out of anyone. As I always say, a good fight is one you can entirely avoid. But martial arts will give your kid a couple of valuable things:

* It will give him a club where his fellow artists give him a feeling he belongs there. They will accept him, his teacher will support him and it will give him a sense he's being accepted for who he is. Any sports club does this, but in my experience, the sense of cameraderie is very strong in a martial arts class
* It will give him confidence. It will allow your child to feel confident in his own body. It will develop his body physically and will simply make him more sure of himself and his ability to defend himself.
* And finally, controversial but still true, if it does ever happen that your kid has to use his martial arts to defend himself and give one of the bullies a black eye he probably deserves, well at least the bullies will understand they shouldn't fuck with him.

I mean about this last point, I've had people tell me that ""violence is never the answer"". This is true to a certain extent. if you can avoid a fight, avoid it. Only resort to violence as an absolute last resort, but sometimes you gotta fight fire with fire. And think... what do you prefer? Having your kid give a couple of bullies a boo-boo and a black eye, or having your kid bring a knife, a gun or a fucking field hockey stick to school out of pure desperation and cause a bloodbath? or worse, hurt himself?"

I've been bullied during highschool, thankfully the bullying has ended with it. After that I graduated in college afterwards, which was a completely different experience. Now I'm 25, but somethings I still get myself stuck in a mindset that I'm not good enough and I break down. Last couple of months It's been happening more frequently specially because every time I fail, triggers some High School Memory. I wonder if any of you guys know if there is any study or anything that could at least explain why after almost 10 years it's getting back that strong. 

Thanks a lot!"
315,Stop Blaming the Bullied Victim,11,5gib3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/5gib3v/stop_blaming_the_bullied_victim/,0,1480920971.0,"Recently, we lost another innocent young person to suicide caused by bullying.  Brandy Vela was a victim of relentless emotional torture at the hands of cowards who chose to hide behind the internet.  I’ve read many articles and posts and even shared her story on the Kindness Matters Facebook page.  Most people who commented in all of those places where compassionate, heartbroken or outraged.  A few were not.  It is those few who I am speaking to now. 

Some have said that those who are bullied should get thicker skin.  
How exactly does a person do that?  Emotions and empathy cannot be taught or untaught – they are just part of a person’s makeup.  To say that someone needs to change who they are in order to accommodate the desires or shortcomings of another is both ridiculous and asinine.  It’s true that many bullied children are highly sensitive and gentle souls.  Why on Earth would we, as a society, ever want to take that away from them?  Would we really prefer to live in a world populated only by people who have walls built around their hearts and who are callous and mean spirited when others don’t meet some arbitrary standard they’ve set for worthiness?  

Some have said that by staying on social media and keeping a cell phone, then the victims asked for it. 
This is idiotic, Puritanical reasoning.  I bet these same people think if a girl wears a short skirt, then she’s asking to be raped too.  Or if a boy is openly gay, then he’s asking to be beat up.  And why should the victims be the one who has to change?  When Peyton was in elementary school, his principal thought the best solution was to change Peyton’s teachers so he wouldn’t be in class with his bully. I put my foot down – I wasn’t going to let Peyton’s life be upended when he’d done nothing wrong.  I held my ground and the school moved the other boy to a different teacher.  

Some have said that the parents of the bullied child are to blame for not teaching the child to love his/herself.  
Let me tell you straight from the horse’s mouth – that is bullshit.  I told my Peyton every single day that I loved him.  I was involved in his school and social life.  I tried to help him navigate a world full of people who are intentionally cruel, although neither of us understood it.  Children who die by suicide don’t do it because they don’t love themselves or because they feel unloved.  They do it in order to escape the pain of their everyday life.  No matter how much a person loves themselves, if life (i.e. the bully) continues to beat you down, you will break.  

Some have said that the victims should just get off of social media. 
Sure, that’s really easy.  Right?  Clearly, those who have made this suggestion do not have teenage children in the 21st century.  Trying to keep a child from the internet is like trying to stop water from flowing downhill.  It is, in a word, impossible.  If they aren’t online to interact with their friends, then they’re using it to keep up with events in school or to communicate with teachers and coaches.  Social media is permanently woven into the fabric of our lives and it’s not going away any time soon.  

Some have said “we need to do something” but none seem to take it farther than a post on social media.
If you do feel that WE need to do something, then DO SOMETHING other than type a few words on a keyboard.  Call your local representatives and find out what is being done in your state to punish those who bully others.  Call your local school district and find out what programs they have in place to help bullied children and those that bully.  Go to the newspaper or T.V. station and find out what they’re doing to bring this issue to the forefront of the public’s attention.  If nothing is being done or if you feel like more should be, then find a way to make that happen.  Start a petition (not an online one – those are a waste of time), start a letter writing campaign with your friends, family, church and neighbors or volunteer to mentor kids at a local school (not just the bullying victims, but the bullies too).  You cannot expect the world to change if you don’t help make it a reality.  Saying “we need to do something” then expecting everyone else to do the hard work simply won’t do. Someone has to be the one to take that first step.  

As we move into the holiday season, we’re bombarded with images of happy families, sounds of joyous carolers and wishes of Peace on Earth.  This year, instead of being blinded by the sparkly lights and tinsel of the season, take some time to really – I mean REALLY– look at your world.  Strive to move those Norman Rockwell images from fantasy to reality -- for yourself, for your family and for every single human being around you.  Elie Wiesel once said “The opposite of love is not hate, it’s indifference.” and Ghandi said “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”  Both very wise men who refused to sit on the sidelines to only bemoan the travesties they saw around them.  Now is your chance to try to be more like them.  I encourage you to be the person who is willing to take a stand against bullying in your community.  Be the person who knows that change will only come when YOU decide that you’ve had enough.  Be the person who will set aside personal comfort and complacency in order to make the world a better place for everyone. 

 Today is the day that you get to decide what your contribution to peace will be.

It was very much gang bullying and people knew me as the “most hated” girl in the year. I have had to take this year off school due to my mental health which spiralled as a result of the bullying.

I won’t ask who you are, I won’t reveal who you are, I won’t judge you and I won’t ask any further questions if you don't feel like talking. I am also completely fine with you not answering messages straight away. There is no pressure to reply straight away and if you don’t feel like talking or it’s a few days between messages that’s totally okay! :)

You need to rant? I’ll listen. You need advice? I’ll try my best. You need to get something off your chest? It will stay between us. No matter what you have experienced, I will try my best to support you.

However whoever is deciding on that needs to wake up (note this wasn't a severe case of bullying and I belive other friends of mine reported him to so he was talked to) but seriously just because bullying takes place takes place off school ground doesn't mean the kids can hurt themselves or it not the schools responsibility to help their students.

I know that's all a teacher could in that situation, but him saying sorry isnt a sufficient ""punishment"" for him bullying me.

He kept doing it so i had enough and i know telling something wouldnt do anything. So one day a few weeks later I decided to get back at him. We had bins on the side of our classroom where we turned in our homework for our various subjects. I saw him turn in his homework and decided how I could get back at him. When I went to turn mine in, I just took his out of the bin and stuffed it in my desk so he wouldn't get credit for his homework because it was missing. 

The teacher later questions him asks him why he didnt do his homework. Him and the teacher go back and forth about how he did his homework and that he turned it into the bin. Being the kid he was; not well behaved, often not doing homework, and a bad kid overall, there was no way the teacher would believe him and think it was a mix up of some sort. So the teacher had him do the assignment again in the hall that day.

End of the day, he sees me stuffing his homework paper into my backpack. He didn't tell the teacher because by that he already had done it again so no use in terms of turning it in. But after that day he didnt bully me at all the rest of the year.

Ive was bullied a lot growing up but this one was one of the times where the bully got the worse end of it."

I told the teachers and school psychologist and at one point, because of the immense turmoil it causes to ones psychy, imagine being 16 and being looked at like you have a disease at the same time being ridiculed and people doing it on purpose then calling you a weak tell tale for telling teachers.. disgusting doesnt even start to categorize the attitude of the other students,

my tutor made it evident in class a few days after i told her, saying i was collectively being bullied by my class after one girl started the rumours (all true), which i was and it was awful, within the class people started talking, saying i am no saint, laughing all together, ganging up on me, some even said i was making it up, that the girl in question didnt start rumours, just because they didnt like me and i was quiet. It was very embarassing, and so after spending the rest of that year being laughted, pointed and ridiculed , stared at as if i was weird and a national joke i changed class..

the following year that girl that started the bullying and some from my old class went around pointing at me laughing, saying out loud 'oohh gay', making others i didnt even know laugh at me.. they couldnt just drop it and move on. Until I left school my life was hell and just got worse and worse until i left high school

If you wanna know more please message me id like to chat. Its just so scary to think, in such a massive world, with over billions of humans, could i have been the only gay student to go through this and have to move class

Fun fact: the girl that bullied me most, is a lesbian now... and no that doesnt make me feel better, there was another student who then turned out to be lesbian and never bullied me , so she was as a person a very popular but very nasty cunt

Would love your thoughts on this subject also :)  


Grades 1-5 I was alone constantly. I had been friends with the bullier but she became possessive, and when I tried to free myself from it, she started it. It would be little actions every day that made me feel as if she was in control of me. It suffocated me and filled me with fear every day.  
During this, my parents pushed me, and told me, that I could handle it. I just had to learn it. I could defend myself. It wasn't bullying, I just exaggerated.   
She finally did something that made it valid, she hit me, and I shifted school, and in the beginning, it was okay. Grades 6-8 she multiplied, and I was again faced with fear daily. They always messed with the things that meant the most to me; my belief, my hobbies, and they made me feel ashamed to be me. This was also the period of time where I experienced what it's like when it moves to the internet. It makes you feel unsafe in your own home.  


Nothing I was exposed to was bad enough that you could pinpoint this one scenario and go; 'this is not okay.' I was only ever hit once, there were bad words but they weren't bad enough, but it drove me mad, and at the same time I was told over and over that it wasn't bullying.   


Today I still ask myself 'Did it count? Was I a victim or am I exaggerating?' but I've learned it doesn't matter, for I was in pain and **everyone deserves to heal.**"

I'll put it into sections, so people can skip parts if they want.

Started school at a public school. About 30 kids to a classroom. Had a teacher and an assistent teacher. The assistent teacher was great, really someone you'd want teaching your kid; kind and understanding. But my actual teacher was one that, as I would later learn through my parents (who, were unaware at the time), apparently picked out one male child each year to torment. That was me. Hadn't played too many ball games as an only child, so when I got my ass kicked during PE dodgeball, I was labelled as being stupid. Not just ""unfit for ballgames"" or something like that, but just labelled as being stupid overall; my parents were told at a parent-teacher conference that I was probably dyslexic based on my performance in dodgeball. Yes, really. On a day where everyone was supposed to show off their projects, my parents saw for themselves that, whenever anyone would make noise I got the blame for it. They saw how I was sitting quietly, some other kid was making a ruckus and, without even looking up, my teacher scolded me for disrupting things. When, one morning, I broke down crying saying I didn't want to go to school, they knew it had hit its limit; I had been the sort of kid all through kindergarten trying to learn as much reading as I could and stoked to start school and learn how to read properly. Took that teacher about six months to break me.

So, my mom contacted a school that her good friend had had good experiences with with her daughter. F-ing magical; kids were nice and - at least on paper, bullying was addressed (there's some difference between when teachers can actually intervene and when intervening is just going to make things worse for the kid; not that I knew that at the time) - and I started there. Absolutely wondrous until I hit about the third grade. One of my classmates - Ivan, his name was - started doing the ""alpha male"" bulls\*\*t. Now, I was the quiet kid, who read books, helped people with their math homework (with the blessing of the teacher, of course) and just kept to themselves. For some reason he decided that I was the person to put down to make him seem big. Now, this is the time to tell you that this was a Catholic school; there was a good amount of time each week I'd be told about turning the other cheek and so on.

So, I endured. Took me four years before I finally snapped from the everyday harassment, teasing and punches (no, I didn't rat to the teachers; even if I was the victim, there's a certain code of honour amongst kids). So, one day, I had enough. So, one day, as I was doing my usual ""reading a book and ignoring everyone else"" he started harassing me, pushing me around and, generally, being a dick. That was enough. I - in hindsight, at this point I was bigger and taller than him, but hadn't really consciously considered it, given that he'd been my bully for years - punched him right in the face. Put him on his ass. His nose was bleeding and he was crying. I kept myself from doing any more than what this lapse of control had caused, sat back, and kept reading my book.

Two weeks went by where he didn't mess with me. Remember, this has been going on every single day for years. Two weeks of respite was unprecedented. Now, maybe, if he had started up again the next day, things would have turned out differently, but over the course of that time I realized that all the ""turning the other cheek"" I'd practiced over the years hadn't had remotely the effect of one well-placed punch. So, when he started probing to see if he could start up again - some stupid comment I can't even remember - I put my bookmark in my book, got up from my chair, walked across the room and punched him in the nose again. Again, putting him on his ass and leaving him with a bloody nose.

Looking back, it's clear to me that the only reason I never went to the Principals office or my parents were called was because every teacher at that school knew exactly what was going on. Probably some of them would've been happy to see it happen years earlier. My bully changed schools two months later and never bothered me again. Met him once since then at a sporting event and at that point, he was a head shorter than me, weighed maybe half what I did and was very quick to act like we'd been the best of friends; I shook his hand, told him that ""yeah, it's been a while"" and left him to his own devices. Our team won, by the way.

&#x200B;

So, that's most of my bullying story done. You can finish here with a ""occasionally, punching someone in the nose can save you a whole lot of trouble"" and I'd still think there's a valid point. But, let's take it to the end of my schooling, at least.

&#x200B;

So, this was a private school. And a small one at that. When I graduated, my class consisted of 13 people total. That was our entire year. And I was the only guy.

Anyway, as you might have guessed from me being the quiet kid who was always reading books, I was somewhat of a nerd. A kid from the grade below me was running a Vampire: Requiem game and I was curious about how exactly the mechanics of the game worked. So, during lunch we were sitting in the hall talking about that. Then this other kid walked up. Still the year below me, known for being one of those sports-freaks who plays competitively in multiple different types of sports. For Americans, just think ""jock.""

He walked up to me, flanked by two of his buddies and went ""hey, I've never seen you fight.""

No, this isn't a cultural divide, that was f-ing odd here too. Anyway, I went ""No, you haven't. Not interested""

So this guy starts going off to his back-up about how I'm useless, harmless, yadayada, and how I'm just too scared to take him on in a fight.

Now, these days, I recognize that just letting that go would've been the smart move. But I was mid-teens. And, so, I was a f-ing idiot. So I told him that, while I didn't want to fight him, I could.

So, again, remember, with two people flanking him, he told me to fight him right then and there. I was a bit worried, not going to lie. Three against one are terrible odds in any case. But I called him out and said ""so it's just you and me right?"" and he agreed. So, I stood up and faced him. Apparently, he felt the need to flex at this point, because he went ""well, those skinny arms of yours? They'll probably break if you actually hit me. Come on, I'll give you the first shot.""

Since I'm not a f-ing idiot, someone who wants to fight me and I have no interest in fighting them? Yeah, first strike isn't something I'll let go past. So, in a self-parody, I make an exaggerated martial-arts style stance. Nod to him and have him nod back. Then I step forward, putting my palm against the centre of his chest. No punch, just making contact. He starts to say something, which I can tell more through my hand than through my ears, because before he's done saying anything my foot is kicking his Achilles tendon and I fully extend that arm. For practical purposes, I put him horizontal in the air by making a leg move forward while his torso was moving backwards. Then, because I didn't want his head to slam into the ground (we're still at school; I could get into trouble), I instead caught him by using my forearm to catch him by the throat, putting him in a head-lock and tapping him on the temple with my free hand and asking him if he was willing to submit.

&#x200B;

The morale of this story:

1. Don't assume that just because someone's unwilling to fight that they're unable to do so.
2. When you do find yourself having to take someone down, do it quick, keep control, but don't follow up unless you absolutely have to.

&#x200B;

My middle-school bully, I have no contact with at all. The later bully, we've actually been coworkers for a while and had fun at reunions.

&#x200B;

I hope this muddy version of a morality tale at least entertains someone. Better yet, teaches someone something. But, you know, I try to be realistic."

So, a couple of my best friends both have people they obsess over. My guy, lets call him Jayden, keeps coming to me for relationship advice; because his girlfriend and him are having problems at the moment. All it really does is remind me of how I'll never be on the opposite side of the problem, because I'll never get a girlfriend. Ive had plenty in the past, but two of which left me for someone better, and the other moved away without saying goodbye. I'll get back into this later on.

My true best friend, and girl I'm currently crushing on; lets call her Katie. Katie and I often have amazing conversations, and used to flirt with each other, a lot. Anyhow she started to obsess over this other guy, who she thinks is really funny and smart. I think he likes her as well, because we often catch him staring at her for no reason. But any time she starts to obsess over him, I think of how other girls had left me for someone better, and this is no different. It eventually got to the point where I made up excuses to leave, so I could go home and cry.

How the actual heck am I supposed to deal this this problem?? Also I am not looking for relationship advice, because I've given up on that stupid love thing; and I know some of you will say that this belongs on r/relationships_advice. But yeah, how do I get this to stop affecting me?"

They crack jokes at my expense all the time.  Other people get teased too but not to the excess I do.  It makes me feel anxious and messes with my confidence.  Any time I tease back or get mad multiple people will team up on me or make it seem like what I’m saying is weird.  They took a screen shot of my recent Instagram post and teased it and they’ve put my Snapchat stories into one of our group chats and tease me.  Sometimes I try to play it cool and laugh it off with them and other times I can’t help it and get mad.  I just don’t know what to do because if they didn’t treat me the way they do I wouldn’t have a problem with it.  I’m very sociable and have never had problems making friends and have never had any teasing that actually bothered me in high school.  I just don’t know how to handle this.  I show them it bothers me and it’ll just give them more reason to tease me.  If I act like I don’t care it all they’ll realize it doesn’t bother me and continue to ostracize me.

Throughout all my years in school I was never bullied, I didn't think this was strange and that ""real"" bullying was just to create more drama for TV series or that these were just exaggerated stories. I've never bullied anyone myself as i've seen no reason to bullying when it only causes harm and i've been told by that it's just cruel. 

 I now obviously know it's a very real thing so many people go through every day, and i've learned that i've been very lucky to never have been put through such a hard situation. BUT now I find myself a bit stuck when talking about such a sensitive topic with friends, I never truly know how respond or react. Since I have never had any experiences with it I am afraid to say something out of line or ask something that will come off as rude. I try my best to just listen and not say anything.

Any tips to things I should and should not mention or ask when talking with my friends?    (I never really mention to them that i've never been bullied cuz I feel like that would be rude or boasting, but I also never lie and tell other i've been bullied)

For 4 years. Every day. By a total 14 people, and 6 at once. I am now 16 and should be in Sixth Form (Year 12) but I am off school because of mental health problems.
Recently I have been feeling quite useless and would like to put myself to use.
Today I was extremely extremely upset, crying to my mum about how I’ll never understand why I was bullied and telling her how much it has impacted my life. 

Self-esteem:

You wonder why is it ME that they have chosen to pick on. You think what is wrong with me, am I just naturally dislikeable? How can I fit in better? You get laughed at for everything you do and get teased. When you think everyone hates you it brings your self-esteem down SO much. I used to be really confident and outgoing, I liked drama and had no problem talking to groups of people. But by Year 11 I had half the confidence I used to have, actually developed stage fright (which I was embarrassed about because everyone knew I liked drama) and my heart would start racing when it was nearly my turn to talk in class (if we were going round the class). I didn’t like myself and my looks at all, and was really insecure. Bully victims are the least likely people to do things like apply for House Captain, or audition for something, or speak in front of their tutor group or speak in an assembly. Bully victims are less likely to take part in general because they don’t want to draw any attention to themself. This brings down their confidence and makes them more introverted people. 

Anxiety/social anxiety:

I haven’t developed agoraphobia (fear/worry about interaction with people e.g. going to the shops and having to see other people, and having them see you) but I would really not be surprised if they are linked. In fact I know bullying can cause social anxiety. Like someone on First Dates could very well be like “I didn’t leave my house for 3 years. I was bullied in high school” and they could be an ADULT. 

Bully victims walk around school feeling like they stand out, constantly afraid that someone will open their mouth and in my case shout at them. This breaks my heart to remember this is still happening to people. The ANXIOUS like ANTICIPATION that it is going to happen is awful. I actually just got used to it. That makes me really sad to think about but I just got used to being treated like that at school. 

I remember very occasionally I would come home and be like “Hello?! Yeah mum I had a great day!”
But I realised that was only a NORMAL DAY. If I had a NORMAL DAY it was an “amazing day”. It was a great day for me if no one spoke to me. 

I completely see why people who are bullied are more likely to have shyness / social anxiety and be more introverted.

Self hatred / self-loathing / lowering self-worth:

I don’t know about anyone else but I questioned myself extremely deeply. I thought I was wrong and I began to hate myself and have urges to punish myself because I thought it was MY fault. I thought it was MY fault. 

It is NOT your fault. It is NEVER the bully victim’s fault. If I asked a bully “Why do you pick on them?” And they were like “They’re weird, they shouldn’t be so weird then” I would tell them just how awful and idiotic they are being. It is always the bullies fault. You do NOT deserve it. It is NOT your fault. 

People’s self worth gets lowered if they are picked on, teased or bullied. You think “clearly no one likes me”. You are beautiful, brilliant, brave, smart, nice and incredibly cool. I honestly think you’re an amazing person. These bullies are not saying you are negative things because it is true - please know it is not true and they are always saying it for some other reason e.g. to be entertaining or just to hurt your feelings. 

Depression and anxiety is incredibly common in bully victims. I am devastated that this is happening. Bullying happens at every school. School was RUINED for me. 

I then got terrible GCSEs as a result of missing school because of mental health problems. I felt so alone. I felt so, so alone. Imagine then getting awful results. I felt like such a failure and had no self-worth. Things started getting really bad and I was very distressed. I started having suicidal thoughts. 

If someone at school has clout and power and has the power to make people turn against you and turn away from you.. that is dangerously powerful. Bullying affects lives a lot more than people think. They people who bullied me are very popular and have friends and are very privileged and will have good jobs and good money. 

I know what it’s like to feel like you don’t belong, to feel like you’re disliked by everyone and people are horrible to you. And I don’t want anyone else to feel like that. Bullying is NOT OKAY. 

I really really want to help anyone who is going through this. You are worth so so much and you are very loved. 

Giving so much love to you all <3 <3 It will get better, I promise. 

Please feel free to dm me if anyone wants to talk :)) I don’t want anyone to feel distressed and depressed because of bullying. No one deserved deserves to feel like that <3 <3 <3"

They are delusional enough to believe that they can just contact me *years* later out of the blue just saying ""sorry"" and expecting everything to be A-OK, fixed and hunky-dory and that we should be close besties like nothing serious happened. 

NO, it is NOT ok and it never will be. Because of their abuse, I am *still* suffering for it 20 years later. I have developed anxiety, depression, post traumatic stress disorder, as well as severe trust issues. Believe it or not, I *still* have recurring nightmares from those days. 

Some feel they have a right to be in my life and that it is up to them whether they leave me alone or not. Most have never even apologised to me and just want to make themselves feel better. When I want nothing to do with them, they get really pissy, calling me ""bitter"", ""unforgiving"" and ""negative"" and have the nerve to get upset with *me*. Well bitch- maybe it might be because I do not wish to have any reminders of those days with you hanging around!!!

Why would I want to disrupt *my* beautiful peaceful quiet life just to make you happy when you never cared about me- let alone any part of my entire existence at any point? I am so much better off without you. My happiness is much more important than yours will ever be.

There was a time and place for apologising, NOT 20+ FUCKING YEARS LATER - it just comes across as fake and selfish. My fraternal twin sister agrees with me 100%  when I say that you should have apologised to me before we left school and moved on into the adult world. 

So please kindly fuck off, leave me alone, go jump in the deepest darkest hole you can find, and rot and die there you bunch of fake, narcissistic, entitled, selfish, self-centred sacks of shit 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻"

I think perhaps I am seeing them as the younger me and picturing their innocence being put through what I went through and it makes me sick.  


Long story short, (as short as it can be, sorry) my dad was a monster. There was NEVER anything remotely sexual, but he was mentally and physically abusive, and although he used to really hurt me, the mental stuff was always the worst and I cannot shake it off. He would punch me in the temples for making sounds when I was eating, he would kick my legs from under me out of the blue because I would have done something I wasn't aware of and he was just general really violent. I remember incidents such as being really sick at about 6 years old and him hitting me hard when I was vomiting for making a mess/vomiting up medicine and I always thought I was doing something wrong. I grew up totally and completely terrified, paranoid and felt completely useless. Him and my mother split when I was 18 months (allegedly because of the way he would treat me as a newborn) but I never had the courage to tell my mum the abuse was happening way into my late teens! To be honest, I had no idea it was abusive and I was convinced it was me. I was scared of him getting into trouble so mentally, I would always take responsibility. He would abuse his deaf, blind and disabled dog in front of me for whimpering which still makes me shudder cold to this day. When I close my eyes so much damaging stuff just comes flooding back! He once threw a brick in the air for a laugh towards me when I was about 12, but it hit me in the eye and I had to lie to me mum about what happened. To this day I have a failed muscle in my left eye as a result, and my eye droops really badly, and  I look ugly. He caused permanent physical and mental damage.  


I am 6""2, bald, with a big beard and people think I am tough. I am tough, on the surface but inside I am ashamed, angry and full of absolute sadness. I feel like my overwhelming love for my children actually hurts me because of everything I endured, and I wake up from nightmares where they are getting  the abuse I got, and it breaks my heart.  


I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years, and I don't want to. I don't want him anywhere near my children, but I just need to find a way to leave it all behind and move on. It hurts me 24/7, follows me like a dark cloud but I keep it well under wraps. I just  want to stop feeling like a child, I am 34 years old with a family, but I genuinely feel like a child trapped inside a shell of an adult!!!!  


The worst stuff was the mental stuff. He would make fun of me if I relaxed and was enjoying something. For example we would be at the fun fair and I would be on a ride, but he would spend the whole time watching, pointing at me and making fun and made me so self conscious to enjoy anything that I stopped having fun in front of him. I just became his depressed little side kick for him to beat and  take loads of verbal abuse off. He would call me useless, tell me I was never going to be anything and that I was ugly and stupid. I just want the overwhelming feeling of feeble, victimhood to end now so I can get on with my life. The man relentlessly fucked me up and I am worried he has damaged me beyond  repair.   


I have COMPLETELY lost my ability to cry or express my pain, but it hurts. Hurts so badly.  


Please can anyone give me some advice? I have been to counselling but it  hurt far too much to talk about and I didn't have the nerve to be honest.  


Sorry for the long post, I would appreciate any advice more than you would know.  


Thank you xxx"

But this got me. So naive.

I’d been playing an online game for many years. My online pic was neutral of flowers. A couple of years ago, I beat FAB from France in the game each week for 3 weeks after I accepted his invite to play. Then, he started to taunt me. Calling me names, but in a playful way at first. All fun, I thought. Went on for a few weeks, then he posted he was going on holiday for a few weeks. When he came back online, he was even more insulting in chat. I was “what the hell is wrong with you?” He said sorry, thought he was messaging someone else. Hmm . . . Red Flag! Should have quit then, but . . . Then, he posts nicely for a few weeks, then suddenly that I’m an old hag, c**t, and I should just die. WTF? I messaged he needs help because he’s getting unstable over a game and I did nothing to provoke him. Stopped messaging him and playing him. He got more vile. I messaged I would report him to the game. He replied, I did nothing wrong. You wanted it c**t. I will kill you! 

I deleted him. I regret not reporting him. I regret not finding a way to “kill” him with words.

I’ve never told anyone. Not my husband or family or best friend that this happened to me. I’m still shamed by this whole encounter."

How would you react you were her?

I'm thinking of reporting her again to the discipline teacher. I keep writing everything I hear to be specific.

Is this normal? Both the reactions and the recording what she says.

Edit: thanks for the support. I finally reported again and have the upper hand. Now they're very weary of me and stop messing with me since I had a confrontation with them and 2 discipline teachers at the same time. Now they can be suspended and the main bully can be expelled if I report again"

Teachers were ganging up on me and told me that I don’t belong. I have been called worse that I do NOT want to say because I just start getting emotional and cry. This led to severe lack of trust of people (especially adults). I have lost a lot of self confidence and always think bad of myself, but I am older now and stronger and wiser though.  She had never apologized to me but she did get what she gave. At this point I am ready to forgive her and let that go this experience made me stronger, braver , smarter,  and a n overall more forgiving person. I wonder how she is doing and hope that she’s is doing well because she deserves some peace from her anger she clearly was angry and that sucks; I mean yes I will always remember what she did to me and there might be a tiny piece of me that wants to hold on but still I just hope she’s happier and I wish the best for her.

He also outed me about 8 months ago, which changed people's perception of me at work, and he has continued to mock me behind my back, commenting on everything from my Instagram stories to who I am supposedly dating.

It is now getting to the stage where I just want to run away. 

He sometimes even talks low-key trash to me on Instagram, and I am so paranoid that I don't know if he is down the pub laughing at me with his mates while he is doing it. I have to be so careful. :(

I have always been a bit of a loner (a weakness, to some) but I like to chat with people when I get the chance - but I am being suffocated by this social bully, and the chance of platonic or professional friendships (or even respect) have all but diminished now thanks to him.

348,Why I didn’t receive help during my time as a victim of bullying,10,bqmyv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bqmyv1/why_i_didnt_receive_help_during_my_time_as_a/,3,1558333399.0,"It was many years ago when I was around 10 or 11 that I was a victim of bullying so my memory might not be that good. At the time a popular type of affectionate gestures were the trend where someone whacks your back quite hard and you laugh it off. However, I was never an open person and physical contact with another person would be highly uncomfortable especially if they whacked me hard. So when that happened, I would turn around and say “Don’t” or “Stop” which was considered amusing for the boys in class. 

Also a rumor got out that I said something racist when I said “Stop monkeying around!” when an African American kid smacked me. Apparently they thought I meant “black people are monkeys” which I totally did not say or mean or even think anything of that sort when I said it. 

Not just that, I don’t really know how to talk to someone and I had a pretty loud voice so people avoided me and labeled me as “annoying” which meant I had no friends. (It wasn’t until later that I had realized this) 

So how did I deal with the constant loneliness? Well I immersed myself in books and laughed EVERYTHING off by either playing deaf whenever someone told me I was annoying and to flop off for group projects. Also I participated in the whacking gesture when they said I was weak minded and a snitch. So day by day passed and I endured being lonely thinking it was normal (actually I didn’t think I was lonely at all because there was people physically around me). 

Since I never told the teacher and acted with them, they started to get more bold to as far as yelling “Hey (my name), who you sit with at lunch? Nobody, cuz you got no friends! Ooooooooooooohhhh~~!!!!!!!” And I laugh it off each time saying I do know a lot of people, that’s not true. It was true. I just never admitted it. 

Soon, typical symptoms showed in my behavior with my addiction to books and my insomnia. Often crying myself to sleep and not wanting to go to school. Cut myself a couple of times and dismissing them as scratches because my mother already had many things on her plate and didn’t need one more.  

The situation got worse as people actually stole my pens. So I tracked down the culprit and told the teacher. With proof by utterly destroying her alibi and the origin of ‘her’ pen. Naturally the teacher didn’t believe me. Actually she said that because I was in sixth grade now, such things I can handle on my own so stop bothering the teacher with trivial stuff. 

Then it happened AGAIN with another pen and my favorite eraser I had gotten as a birthday present. I tried to solve it by demanding its return but in the end, what can I do? Tell the teacher? Tell my totally existent friends? Slap them? The one that stole my eraser cut it up and sold it. 

In the end, I tried to report them for bullying and the teacher once again stated I was overreacting. People called me a snitch for it that I didn’t dare try again. I told my mother but what can she do either but give me totally useful words of encouragement. so in the end I reached a conclusion. 

This pit of loneliness I’m in is just my own fault. I was overreacting. I am annoying which is why I have no friends. I am treated like a joke because I kept telling them “stop” and “don’t”. 

Later on, I also realized that trying to tell an adult is useless. In their eyes, bullying is stuck to people whacking each other around into lockers and such. Or maybe being called names on the internet. Also if they did believe me what can they do? Make them become my friends? Mostly get them to leave me alone but I was already alone in the first place. 

So I gave up and endured until I got in to a selected middle school where you test to get in. Far far away from those who made me feel loneliness. 

Today I look back and see myself in their shoes. I don’t think they realized it. That they hurt me and made me lonely. I don’t think they knew what they did was bullying."

Not like where she was graduating just where the students get together and have a pep talk and get to have open communication with other families. Anyways there is a slideshow of senior pictures at this event and you had to have sent it in by a certain date that they did not tell us until last minute. It won't have killed them to have sent a letter home with the students to their parents to let them know where to submit the pictures. Despite my frustrations, we were still able to get the pictures in on time. Anyways the person leading the slideshow was one of my daughter's teachers who for some reason she never got along with. My husband and my daughter and I went to the event and my daughter's professional senior photos were not on the slideshow or in the pamphlets given out like all the other senior photos were. My daughter was upset but went to go ask the teacher who was supposed to be running this what happened and if she could put it up for the senior slideshow later in the day. Instead, she was not allowed to talk with that teacher and had to get yelled at by another teacher who had the nerve to blame my daughter saying it was her fault the teacher didn't do her job and even claimed my daughter was lying about sending the pictures in. She told my daughter she was making up accusations against this teacher. She then told my daughter she was wrong to be upset about the pictures because a photo on a slideshow wasn't all that big of a deal and she should be proud of her hard work as a senior rather than getting all upset over photos on a screen and that she should act more ""Christian"" and forgive the teacher and accept people make mistakes all while repeatedly refusing to let my daughter speak with the actual teacher who caused all this.

Our mother passed 3 years ago and his father signed over his rights to me. 

Current situation... We have had a bully situation for going on 6 weeks now. Our current issue is one of these said bullies made it into my brother's class and stayed. He is not supposed to be in the same building, let alone the same class as my brother. 

This happened Wednesday last week. Thursday I went to the school to try and get answers. After being there for almost 3 hours and really getting no where with the vice principal and the principal refusing to speak with me I left... Half way home I received a call from the school stating I should keep my brother home for his safety and so they could investigate... They explained he could stay but there was no guarantee that they could keep him safe... How exciting is that?

Friday rolls around and I call the school at 830 when they open to speak with the VP about the investigation. Nothing... Tried her direct line at 930, 1045, 1130, 12, 130, 215, 330, 4, 410, and 430 when they close. Absolutely nothing. Even my emails went unanswered. 

My brother gets home and says ""sis, ive lost all hope"" and it broke my heart. I asked ""why buddy"" he explained that the VP pulled him aside and told him the principal reviewed the security cameras for 48 minutes and said the bully never went anywhere near his class... 

So I talked with him... Asked if it was a ploy just to get the kid out of his hair because he's scared to just tell me... He looke me dead in the eyes and said ""no sis... I remember exactly what he was wearing... Exactly how he was sitting and just staring at me""... So I told him I will 100% back him up and I believe him. 

So here we are today... I started calling the school at 830, and shockingly... Nothing... I plan to go down today and ask to see this video. I want proof!

355,My bullying story,10,asjxc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/asjxc0/my_bullying_story/,1,1550665826.0,"so i know that this story may seem small but it really affected me which i will get into later.

&#x200B;

i was in 4th grade at the time that this happened and i was in a group with these 2 girls, twins, cared for each other and had other friends they were nice to, but hated me. Our group consisted of 5 people  B1 (bully 1) B2 (bully 2) K, G, and me

i look back on it and laugh at these girls and feel more confident knowing that they couldnt bring me down. these girls made my year hell. **yes** the whole year it was a group project that lasted the **whole** year. the people in my group were relatively nice i didnt have many friends as i was the weird kid, so i just joined up with these girls.

i wanted to make friends with B1 and B2 so i asked them to join they said yes and the first couple of days were fine. the next did not go so well they treated me like crap. they said i wouldnt contribute even though they shot every idea i had and stole them ignored me when i was talking started teasing me and my friends and calling us rude names and started to write a letter to my teacher telling them that i was not helping in the group so i took it to my guidance counselor  i had talked with her in the past about other topics that were bothering me so when the girls denied it she dismissed us but continued talking to me about it. i started to tell her everything they were doing and she tried to help but it didnt help.

i know it all sounds generally innocent and you are probably thinking how could this have done this to me. i just cant explain how it made me feel. i would go into class crying almost everyday and would make any excuse to stay out of school. at one point i refused to go to school and my dad had to drag me into the school. it didnt help that rumors were being spread about me. 

there is so much more to tell and this barely goes into detail. i ended up getting very anxious and to put it simply when i would close my eyes i would see things that would scare me so badly i would start screaming and crying every so often stopping and not moving only to start again soon. i started seeing a therapist that didnt help. and now i still am very depressed and anxious. although now im a better more confident person. and now i look back on those girls and laugh them doing this to me made me a stronger person and im happy i was able to get through it

I told him to ""shut the fuck up"" and that ""Im not a fucking school shooter""

So basically i try to find the principle and i couldn't so i told my cousin (who's class i was in) to text her that i wanted to talk to her.

The next period the superintendent comes into my class and tells me to grab my stuff, i was calm about it and just grabbed everything that i had and walked with him into his office.

He asks me to take off my jacket and starts searching me for a gun (Didn't know at the time) all i had was two lighters (which were empty and he didn't really care) and then we started talking, he asks me ""did you say you want to shoot {Name}?"" I told him no which i was a bit confused at the time but didn't think about it>

So he brings in two kids, the one he asked about, and the one who i told to stfu. and he asks them about their side of the story

so basically, this kid lies saying that i said something about wanting to shoot the kid from before and i just simply shook my head and waited until i was able to talk, the superintendent asks me if i said this and of course i said no (i would never say dumb shit like this)

So we basically go back and forth trying to get the story straight and the superintendent decides to ask for a witness, thank god, there was one, and this kid backs me up saying that someone said something about school shooter, at the time there was three cops there and one decides to start talking about their dumb decision

He tells that what they said, and bullying people eventually push people to end up doing those things, and he basically makes both the kids apologize (suggested) and they did, im not sure if kid 1 (The one who was told that i wanted to shoot them) was actually apart of the situation or not, but honestly i don't care

thankfully nothing happened to me (asides the situation being on national news) and im fine, the principal checked on me asking if i was ok and i told her i was

im planning on recording so that in case this happens again ill have more evidence about what happened"

After Elementary school ended we all split our different ways never seen him again since until after 7 years later I was a TA for my Boxing coach in my college. Then who do run I into. Yes the bully from Elementary is taking the boxing class. As soon as I made eye contact on him he looked like he didn't really recognize me (I was kinda obese if I remember and chubby). Soon as I started walked to him to help him on his form I said ""Hey wassup, we went to the same elementary remember? The one chubby asian kid lol"" He straight up opened his eyes and I was just chuckling. But I just said I didn't really care that was the past so I didn't really have a grudge on him and already forgave him.

Yes I've been bullied a lot in my highschool years. Often escalated to fist fights where I got my ass handed to me a lot of the time. 

Fast forward today, I'm a 35 year old man. At present I know I am a decent fighter. Ive had MMA training for about 6 months, my fists are hard as rocks from all the knuckle push-ups I've been constantly doing... I routinely punch metal beams at my work or industrial tables or solid brick walls when nobody is looking. 

I am so obsessed with making sure I'm combat ready. I can't just sit still or stand still. I just HAVE TO be at least sucking in my abs to harden them... lifting weights... etc you get the idea... 

I know that if I had my present level of fighting skills and conditioning back when I was a 16 year old, I'd be able to destroy most people in a fight and probably would have had a reputation as an ass kicker who you shouldn't mess with. I'd be feared and left alone in highschool and not bullied. 

Yet my highschool memories of being bullied because I was weak then still haunt me. Sometimes to the point where I look at myself in the mirror and call him weak and pathetic and how he has to get stronger and he's not tough enough because he looks like a weak pushover, etc... 

I dunno. Bullying had made me mentally ill to a certain extent? 

Anyone else here can relate?"

366,I'm still haunted by the girls who bullied me almost 10 years ago.,9,1kaq67,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1kaq67/im_still_haunted_by_the_girls_who_bullied_me/,2,1376450686.0,"Tl;dr: A bunch of girls I thought were my friends ruined my confidence 10 years ago, and I'm still living with it today.

I've been thinking about my bullies a lot lately, and I really want to share my story, if for no other reason than that it's slightly therapeutic every time I tell it.

When I was a kid, I went to a month long sleepaway camp every summer. Starting at age 10, I went there for 5 years in a row. Every camper was assigned to a cabin with about 10 to 20 kids of their same gender and age. In the interest of keeping friends together, the camp would keep cabin groups the same year to year, even though the physical cabin we stayed in would be different. It was a really nice thing for them to do-- if you actually liked the people in your cabin, that is.

I was never popular, but I really wanted to be. I was a nerd who couldn't accept that I was a nerd. There were about 10 typical popular, pretty girls in my cabin, the type who read US weekly and wore earrings and make up in 5th grade. There were 2 weird,  nerdy girls. And there was me. The weird girls actually liked me, and I did become friends with them, but it was never enough. I tried so hard to become a part of the popular circle, but I knew I was never really accepted. They left me out of their inside jokes and their late night gossip. But I persisted, and kept trying way too hard to be friends with them.

My fourth year at camp, when I was 13, they actually started welcoming me a little more. I still wasn't as chic and fashionable as they were, but I was dressing a little better and acting less spazzy (at least I thought so). They talked to me more and were a little nicer to me, and sometimes even laughed at my jokes. I thought I had finally made it. It may be trivial, I know they weren't even people worth liking, but it meant SO much to 13 year old me to finally feel like I wasn't one of the weird outcasts anymore.

Right near the end of 8th grade, a few months before my fifth and final year of camp, I got a message on Myspace. I still remember the basic gist of it:

>Hey, this is Catherine, Katy, Haley, Bary, and [maybe a few others, at least half the popular girls]. We just wanted to let you know that we all hate you...

They then went on to list, in about 5 paragraphs, how everything about me was horrible. I was fat, ugly, flat chested, I couldn't play guitar, by singing voice was horrible, my make-up made me look like a clown, etc etc etc. Oh, and of course, Jesse, the popular guy I had a huge crush on hated me too. I was devastated. I went to Bary's Myspace page with the intention of messaging her, asking wtf was going on and if she really was a part of that message. When I got to her page, I saw comments between her and Haley right on her fucking public wall, making fun of me. I IM'd Jesse and asked if what they said was true. He reassured me that he didn't hate me, and I felt much better, until he said goodbye and then blocked me (I could tell because on my other SN, I could see he was still logged on). 

To sum up the rest of the story, I replied a few times, then finally just ignored Catherine's messages. I went to camp, knowing already that I wasn't gonna be in the same cabin as them again because they had all decided to do the Adventures program, and I barely saw them at all. Catherine had the nerve to friend me on Facebook a few years later. I asked her why the fuck I would accept her request, and she said ""I find you entertaining."" Request denied, obviously.

The whole incident really shook up my confidence. I really believed that if so many people agreed I suck, it must be true. I had so much trouble believing that anyone actually liked me, I still do to this day. I worry people are just pretending to be nice to me, but hate me behind my back. The worst part is, I dream about them. Every couple of months or so, I'll dream that I'm at camp, in the same cabin as them, fully aware of how much they hate me. What's interesting is that recently, in my dreams, I've been getting more aggressive and confrontational towards Catherine. I'm not afraid of her anymore, just angry.

I'm going into my senior year of college now, and I've gotten much better at trusting people, better at being outgoing and making friends, better at *choosing* friends, and better at liking myself. But it still makes me so angry when I think about that cunt Catherine leading a happy, normal life. I want to know that her life sucks, I want her to have dropped out of high school, gotten knocked up or addicted to crack, gotten her heart broken a million times worse than mine, gotten everything I feel like she deserves. But I know she probably has a great, mostly happy life with a bunch of friends who don't realize what a piece of shit she is, or are equally shitty pieces of shit themselves. I still have to live with the fallout of what she and her bitchy friends did to me today, and she has to live with nothing. It's not fair.

PS. I have tried counseling, many times, but nothing has really helped. I've gotten where I am today through the help of my friends much more than through the help of my therapists."

Let me explain it. In mid school I've been a bullying victim. Beatings, bruises, emotional, all the stuff. More than a decade pass and somehow when I find a person reassembling the character of my past bullyes, I get the feelings of despise and yet I get into interaction with them and somehow I make a different connection with him than with the rest of my co-workers. Somehow I try to befriend him even though i despise him. I try to avoid him and end up talking with hin. I somehow let myself become a close friend to that person, even though I don't like his attitude at all and ,without realizing, I let him dominate me, giving him all the praise and making myself look like a looser. 

Somehow I sabotage myself and it's like I'm giving him reasons to bully me. It happens ONLY with that kind of person. Arrogant, narcissistic, aggressive, ignorant."

372,I want to get over the past,8,grmzz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/grmzz8/i_want_to_get_over_the_past/,16,1590625961.0,"Last year, I was bullied by someone who I trusted a lot, they assassinated my character and turned all my close friends against me. 

I was part of the cheerleading team with this person at that time and in cheerleading I would find it hard to be energized and would often skip practice as everybody in the team were (I wouldn’t say bully) but just basically talked trash about me in front of me and in such an obvious way that everyone knew I knew. And me being unenergized ruined my reputation even more, they said I was dragging the whole team down, that I was an entitled little brat, I ended up quitting and stuff went back to normal after a few months. But my reputation was still damaged.

After I left, I met new people but I just couldn’t trust anyone again (and still can’t) because I’m just so afraid that history would repeat itself again. But everyone around me seemed to have moved on, somehow the cheerleading team started talking to me again including the person that started all of the bullying in the first place, they even asked me why I quit. And to be honest, I was pissed, like you hurt me so much and you have the audacity to come to me and ask me why I quit? 

And when my new friends asked me how I feel, I would say that I wasn’t pissed or that I forgave them and stuff like that, but i still feel so hurt and so angry, and I can’t help myself, I have so much bottled up anger, I know that it’s unhealthy and I’m scared that one day I might blow up. I have so many unanswered questions, like why was I their target? Why didn’t anyone believe me? Why did I ignore the red flags when they were presented to me? 

I want to trust people again, I want to move on and I don’t wanna keep myself trapped in this box of negative emotions. Now even the word “cheerleading” would trigger me so much that I would breakdown every time I hear it.

Apparently people now know me as a doormat who will keep on forgiving you even if you do something horrible and I created this image myself, just because I didn’t express any anger after what happened, people don’t show me any respect because they think they can get away with anything with me and that “oh she won’t mind”, I don’t know how long I can keep this persona of being “forgiving” and “kind”. I just want to move on, I don’t want to keep on lying to everyone including myself, I just want to live again. 

Am I wrong for being sad or angry? Why can’t I just move on? How am I supposed to move on? I feel so weak and I know it’s not true but I still do, I just feel so weak that I can’t move on."
373,Passive Aggressive bullying at workplace,9,ergmj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ergmj2/passive_aggressive_bullying_at_workplace/,12,1579571101.0,"Hello, I am 22yo and just started a new job 3 months ago and there is this guy (26yo) at my workplace who is always passive aggresive with me. I am a very shy and quiet guy and I always go to lunch alone because I like it this way. I also struggle with high anxiety when ever I feel uncomfortable. I start stuttering and become very nervous when I sometimes interact with other coworkers.

So everyone in my company is very nice and dont even care about what I do, but there is this one asshole who for example ask me in front of everyone why I go alone to lunch with the intend to say to me I am a loner but without really saying it. When he sees that I become nervous  he just gives this dirty smirk to the other coworkers.  He sometimes even when I start to stutter he just looks at me and smiles and than says ""what did you say? you have to speak louder!"".

I hate to say it but he is kind of a good looking guy and I am not. he sometimes comes to me and ask me how many bitches did I fuck this weekend when he cleary knows the answer is none. He is asking me all kinds of uncomfortable questions. Its hard to discribe this kind of bullying and its really weird because he knows exactly I know what he is doing but he just stares me dead in my eyes when he is doing it.

Am I overreacting or what should I do about it?"

She was understandably nervous at first.  Just when it seemed like she was finding her footing, another girl in her class started bullying her - on the bus, at recess & in the class; both verbally and physically. Her entire year was miserable and heartbreaking.  The most the principal and teacher would do is move her seat on the bus and 'pay extra attention' to the situation which did absolutely nothing.

This year started very well.  New teacher & principal, and my daughter put in an effort to befriend her bully.  She was excited about school, and everything was going beautifully until a month ago when her bully started up again.  Now she cries every day before and after school, and is terrified of going.  The new teacher and principal are just regurgitating the same bs about keeping and extra close eye on the situation, but all that has accomplished is force the bully to be sneakier about it, and only does it when she is least likely to get caught, or disguises it as an accident.

This bully is a known element as other students have also had issues with her.  I met the kid and found her to be a real piece of work, and other parents have said the same.

I get that my daughter will have to deal with bullies and conflict throughout life, and need to learn how to... but not at 5 years old.

Any suggestions on how to handle this?  So far the schools solution has been utterly useless and completely ineffective.  They seem unwilling to deal with the issue head on, and in the meantime my daughter has to deal with this brat every day."

I'm a christian and I'm used to jokes being shared mocking my religion and usually I take them well , not taking them seriously. This post I saw on an atheist meme page wasn't funny and I fell into the trap of standing up for myself by asking why he felt the need to post something like this ?

I was saying that I believed that people should be able to believe in who they want and have freedom of religion. Then he went on to call my faith 'ridiculous' and a 'fantasy designed to make you feel better' .

He then posted one of my comments onto his story taking what I said out of context , effectively making me look stupid in front of all of his followers, including the guy who shared his initial post in the first place

As someone who's already depressed and feels a lack of support in my life, this just made me feel terrible . All I was doing was trying to was express how people could be any religion they wanted to be, no matter if they were atheist, christian, muslim, etc."
377,I experienced gaslighting at the age of 10... I think?,10,dwbnce,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dwbnce/i_experienced_gaslighting_at_the_age_of_10_i_think/,12,1573776841.0,"I posted this to another subreddit too because idk. I just want it off my chest. Part of me thinks I was bullied and another part of me thinks maybe I'm just the monster they said I am.  I'm 20 years old and female so it seems kind of stupid to focus on this now but it still hurts.
In elementary school I had a group of friends, and a best friend ringleader from whom I was inseparable. Then one day in fifth grade, she started running away from me. On the playground I would run to find her and she would hide from me beneath the play structures. When I would catch her, she would say she was scared I was going to kill her or hurt her. When I approached my friends they would all tell me the same thing. I was confused. I didn't think i had never done anything bad, let alone want to kill anyone. I apologized and thought it was behind me. But she kept running. She would say I wanted to kill her and that I was a monster and I was evil.
My friends soon stopped talking to me. I would tell my parents what was going on and they told me not to keep talking to her. My mother suggested getting a pet rock, something, anything to do that was better than being around her. But I would go back every time she said she was sorry. I wanted so desperately for people to like me because I wanted to prove I wasn't a monster. Not to believe what was said. Most days at recess I would sit on the blacktop if my friend decided I was evil that day. I sat next to the safety. The safety didn’t care much about what was going on. Kids will be kids, girls at that age are cruel. All of the usual excuses. 
My friends decided we needed to have a court to settle our differences on whether or not I was a monster. All of my friends were invited to the playground equipment on the rope square we would climb and sit on top of. We met and I remember my friend yelling about how I was a bad person and like to hurt people. I got angry at what she was saying so I got off the playground equipment and went to run away. Before I went I shook the equipment to get everyone’s attention. That’s when she pretended to fall off. She cried alligator tears about how I tried to murder her. I tried to kill her. Everyone saw how I was a bad person. No one spoke to me after that. Maybe I shook the equipment as a sign I was giving up. Giving in to what she was saying. Maybe I didn’t even shake it and I simply remember doing it because she said I did.  The memory is blurry but also vivid? Maybe I did try to hurt her. It's hard to know anymore since I was so young and I was hurting inside.
Even at my own birthday party, my friends kicked me out of their group. I went down the water slide alone at the water park while they played together in the pool. My parents saw. I felt miserable. I wonder how my parents felt still, I can only guess helpless.
At the same time this was going on, my friend would walk home with me every day. We would walk down the road and she would roll apples from an apple tree into the street to watch the cars run them over. I did it maybe once or twice. It was fun. And she told me to do it. Who knows what would have happened at recess the next day if I said no? One day a counselor called me down to the office and said a teacher had seen me throwing apples at people’s cars. She said there would be disciplinary action. I was shocked. I had never been in trouble. I didn’t think what I was doing was even wrong. When I got home my parents yelled at me. I protested and said I wasn’t throwing anything, and that my friend and I were rolling apples into the road that were already off the tree and it wasn’t hurting anyone. They put me in day care because they didn’t trust me. I remember this still and part of me resents it, i felt like I was being punished for someone else's wrongdoing. but I also understand my parents probably just wanted me away from this girl. 


So in summary, I think I was bullied, but I was bullied by saying that I was a bad person and a monster so it's hard for me to determine whether or not I even was bullied. I still have problems getting close to friends and I have this need to be perfect in every way and never, ever do anything wrong or bad. When I make a mistake I think I'm a failure and a bad person. I don't know if this is too long, or stupid to post, but I'm twenty now and the pain still hasn't gone away and it's led to more abuse and loneliness. Pretty sure I'm upset about being gaslit by a nine year old, which is just so dumb of me."

379,I allowed bullying to steal my voice,9,dtoyzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dtoyzw/i_allowed_bullying_to_steal_my_voice/,3,1573290082.0,"I was a mute for a good portion of my life as I took endless streams of abuse from elementary school to high school. I mistakenly believed at the time that being quiet and essentially mute would prevent me from being noticed. After it did not work, I just doubled down then tripled down on it until I rarely ever opened my mouth to speak. This led to unintended consequences.

 Since I did not exercise my vocal cords like any other muscle, they became weaker and weaker. Since I did not speak during puberty, my voice would continue  crack long after puberty should have ended and in high school, this made me a target for even more bullies. I was forced to suppress my voice even further as I was terrified of ridicule. In college, there were no more bullies for me but it took me months to actually comforted speaking only to close friends. By this point, my voice was left as little more than raspy whisper that was barely audible to anyone even those who stood next to me. I was asked constantly if I was sick because it sound like there was a ""frog"" in my throat. I looked at different common causes for hoarse voice: asthma, allergies, acid reflux. I tried numerous over-the-counter medications and home remedies. I finally had an X-ray performed on my neck to rule masses or goiters but it came back as normal. When I blamed my weak voice for everything bad in my life including the fact that I lost my residency training spot due to my crippling fear of speaking and expressing my thought process. The loss of this spot meant that I could not be employed as a doctor in the US but I was still left with the crippling $250,000 debt with no way to pay it off.  I felt like I had nothing left everything that my bullies had said about me was true. My thoughts of suicide were constant at this point but my only hope of allowing myself to truly live a normal life was to find a way to fix my voice.

 I could not find any reason until two days ago, I was again looking at different next level treatment options i.e. voice therapy and injection laryngoplasty to both naturally and artificially change the cause of what now held my life back: my weak voice. As I watched hours of videos and read papers, I was shocked to discover that I did this to my own anti- bullying defense measure did this to me. Furious and exhausted after 48 hours without sleep, I found this reddit page. Slightly delusion and paranoid, I spent 18 hours furiously typing and I ended up with a 30 page ""memoir"" of my entire history of bullying. After I read it, I found that it was barely coherent. I then focused on the first part of memoir with plans for the second. While rereading and organizing my own words, I emotionally broke down. For years, I have been telling people that I was never happy in my life. As I read my more organized version of my own memories, I found that for a brief shiny moment in my life. This moment and the events that resulted in my descent into rage, bitterness, despair, and hatred which I was inevitably forced completely seal off in a small corner of my mind. I was an emotionless husk of my former self. I never did anything, everything happened to me. After my eyes were opened, I believed the best course was to submit this trigger event in my life where I lost my voice and allowed others to define who I was.

\--

When I first started writing my clearest memories only of my past, I believed that it was only fitting to start there. I was born and raised in a loving middle class household in inner suburbia. My parents divorced when I was two that was outside the range of my cognitive memory. In my early childhood, I had an almost photographic memory but it was mostly focused on thing that made me angry. At the age of three, my grandmother lost a small toy, that was probably worth no more than a quarter. However in my 3 year old mind, it was the most important thing ever.  As she strapped me into the car, she stated that I would forget about it by next week. After 20 years, I still remember because she told me that I would forgot that I saw that as a challenge. I sent that memory aside in a special place so I would always remember so that I could remind her. Over the years, this area set aside for my grudges would be packed and cluttered after I entered the 3rd grade.

I was always a shy and quiet kid but I was able to open up to people after spending a little time getting to know them. I was able to make friends by stating a line, that I think I obtained from watching Mr. Rogers, ""Do you want to be my friend."" Every friendship, I had until that point, I was compelled to ask them all that question before I considered them to be a trustworthy friend. My early friendships helped me to deal with the ""textbook caricatures of bullies,"" these bullies were older and bigger than me but I may have only seen them once a day before continuing with my usual business. They never really got under my skin as much as they took joy from my pain. They were a fleeting nuisance that actually took up little space in my emotional memories. The support of my friends held me to maintain a relatively healthy sense of self-worth, confidence, and pride. During this pride of my life (pre-K to 2nd grade), I switched schools often but I was usually able to make one good friend. One time that I could not make any friends at a school, I was always comfortable with asking my mother to transfer me out. I was spoiled so I thought that would be the normal course of my life. I was still able to remain emotional stable and happy with my self-worth was intact. It was an easy pattern for me to follow: I timidly enter the school and find someone else who was usually alone to talk to then as they gained my trust, I would asked them to be friends; rinse and repeat with every school. Each time that I found that this formula worked, I would enter a new school with less and timidity.

During the 2nd grade, I was happy and excited about each day of school. My grades steady went from As and Bs to As with one B to finally perfect straight As. My straight A report card was the crowning achievement of my life. I cherished that memory because it was one of the few happy moments, I had left. Yesterday, when I remembered that singular moment, I broke down because I realized that I never had a truly happy moment in almost 20 years. It was greater at least to me than my high school, college, or medical school graduation. Thinking now about it with a more rational state of mind today, I was unsure if it was truly that big a moment in my life or was it based purely on nostalgia. Either way, that shining moment came and went, I was forced to move forward with my life. After completing the 2nd grade, my mother got a new higher paying job at a company in the southern part of my state and again had to move schools.

Entering this new school, I will admit I was feeling deeply uncomfortable. It was completely new and alien to me than any of my school that came previously due to its new location. In the beginning, it started off fine as I used my now well warn tactics for gaining new friends to my advantage with some success. I was able to make four new friends in my first week which felt good to me. Unfortunately, this was around the same time that I gained my newest bully, Chase \[not real name\]. Unlike my previous bullies, he was unique, up until that point. Chase was the same grade as me and happened to me in the same class. He also the first bully that came with a pair of sycophants that followed him like lapdogs. I do not know what I did to draw his attention but he tormented and only me. I think I would have started my breakdown then if I did not have my friends with me.

However, a few months into the school year, my steady course of life began to spiral out of control. I lost contact with the best and oldest friend from my previous town. One of my new friends moved away but I had two more so I was able to manage. A month later, another friend moved away as well and it was starting to get to me as I was left with one friend to talk to and confide in. As my emotional state began to decline, Chase decided to increase the pressure with name calling and threats. After only the first quarter of  3rd grade, I received my first C+ on my report card and was inconsolable. I suffered a big blow to my pride at that point however as the year progressed, I started to become numb to the decline of my grades. Chase  continued to bother me but only with names, criticism, and pointed comments. The teachers would do nothing at this point and referred me to the guidance counselor. The counselor recommend that I start using ""I"" messages to express to Chase how his bullying made me feel when I tried it and he laughed. When it failed, I was told that incessant and infuriating rhythm “sticks and stones may break my bones but words could never hurt me” every time, I complained after that. It was at this time that I started asked my mother for a sibling. She refused but believing I wanted companion, I was given a puppy. In my mind, I did not want a companion or a puppy to play with, I was hoping to have a replacement for me in case, I died. At that time, I was only beginning to understand the concept and permanence of death for about two years. This moment was, when I started to understand the concept of suicide. I did not come up with my first plan for about four more. 

As horrible as 3rd grade was for me, 4th grade truly tested with or not I was worth anything. During this year, I was separated from my last true friend, I was placed in the same class as Chase. I came to find out that Chase was relatively small compared to my newest bully, my 4th grade teacher, Mrs. G. Out of the many bullies, I had up til then and afterwards, Mrs G was the worst bully ever. She is the only person who I really blame for shattering the person, I once. I have found it especially hard to forgive because she was the only **adult,** I knew, that held a vendetta against a 8/9 year old child for something, he did not even do. My mother was a cringe inducing, overprotective, helicopter parent. I was her only child so I have to believe that she had my best interests at heart when she went to meet with my new teacher at the parent/teacher conference. I tried to find a memory that would hint at what she may have said to Mrs. G but I never found out. Unfortunately, the following day, I found out that I was placed at the top of Mrs. G's shit list when she called out me out and humiliated in front of the entire class for a suggestion, my mother had made. It went downhill from there, she took almost every opportunity to berate. In one instance, she made fun of my love of Pokemon, when the Pokemon craze was just beginning to peak in popularity. In another instance, near the start of new millennium, I asked her a question involving the importance and meaning of the millennium. She snapped back by ""how often do you think a millennium comes around."" This was my first time, I ever heard the word, millennium. I was only 8 or 9 years old, I did not watch the news or read the newspaper.  I did not know what the word even meant that's why I asked my teacher. Prior to meeting her, I was considered to be a teacher's pet. I became attached and loved every one of my previous teachers. It was my 3rd grade teacher, who gave me my first C, for help and advice because I was absolutely terrified of Mrs. G but like always nothing changed. I truly believed that she hated me and I could do nothing to change that. For years, I had seen my teachers as a 3rd parent but she destroyed that concept for me. I only remember a few lessons from her. 

1. You can not talk to, put your trust in, or confide in any teacher, they are to be feared and avoided.

2.  Never raise your hand to answer a question if there is even a chance that you may get the question wrong

3.  Always keep my mouth shut and never speak up about anything bothering you.

It was at this point I developed my lay low strategy to avoid anyone's attention. I foolishly believed that if I started to withdraw again and spoke up less that I would avoid their attention and leave me alone. My perception of school, teachers, and people in general were changed by these experiences. I used to have a love for school and teachers. Chase and Mrs. G made me realize I hated school and feared the weekdays since it meant, I had to go back. Due to those two, I developed and still have a deep-seated fear, distrust, and hatred of teachers despite meeting several good ones in my life. In particular, Mrs. G removed my love of learning as my primary reason for doing well for school. She showed me that I can use my hatred and spite worked just almost well. My memories of Chase and Mrs. G sparked the hatred that would drive me further and further in life with every other bully adding fuel to the fire.

From that the parent/teacher conference onward, I had the joy of dealing with those two bullies with no way to react or respond as fighting back would only hurt me in the end. These two parasites ate away my sense of happiness, pride, and self worth while with my only solace being to fan the flames of my hate. Any other attempt, I made, was rebuffed so I was simply forced to stew with thoughts of vengeance in my mind. I was completely alone after that I rarely ever saw my remaining friend. Every method tried failed and every person, I turned to, did nothing. As I previously stated,  I was always a quiet child, at this moment, I completely shut mind from the world. I surrendered to my bullies and I suppressed my emotions as hard as I could. While on the outside, I attempted keep my cool. On the inside, I had a volatile ball of hatred and emotion that had only schoolwork to express itself but it was ready to burst. Any small provocation would have set me off and it Chase, who took it upon himself, set me off with a minor slight. He stole a tennis ball, that I had been playing with and proceed to throw it on the roof of the school where I could never get it back. I completely lost it; I took out all my pain and suppressed fury on him until I was finally pulled off. When I was asked to explain myself, all I could say was that ""he threw my ball on the roof."" As a 9 year old and coming to my senses, I knew that was a ridiculous reason. Since I was alone away from everyone else, no-one else saw who started besides me, Chase, and his two lackeys.  No longer the model student and the fact, that I did hit him first, I was the only punished with a suspension for a few days while my punches were his only punishment for pushing me to my breaking point. After this moment, I felt that I needed to leave that school. I knew that no-one else would have messed with me like he did. Chase was afraid of me, that last time, I saw while I attempted to break bread. I was still broken and scared because Mrs. G was the only one was really afraid of with Chase being mostly an after thought. I also did not think that I could ever be friends with any of them. Therefore, I felt like my isolation would have continued and I would have been stuck with the bully, Mrs. G.

I carried my lessons, I learned for this school to the next. I tried has to suppress my anger and emotions but since, fighting was the only satisfactory outlet, I had, I used. I held on hard to those memories and those of all my subsequent bullies to motivate to reach the final revenge. In turn, I continued to act like nothing any one said or did to me, any effect had on me. Every muscle in my body tightened from dealing with stress and hold onto my pain that after a few years, I no longer noticed that I was doing it. I could not relax and a ""soothing"" massage was painful. My voice was barely audible raspy whisper and it took a lot of effort for me to make it louder. My teeth would grind together causing my gums to severely erode. I developed painful muscle spasms in my face and arms. Every urine test, I took, had protein in which could either come just exercising or the early stage of kidney. After performing a pulmonary function test, my doctor believed I had pulmonary fibrosis because I breath in as deeply as normal person should have. On top of all that, I was diagnosed at 15 with limited scleroderma, a rare autoimmune condition where my body tries to destroy my skin resulting in the intense burning sensation, thankfully it was limited and went into remission with steroids. it never reached my major organs. In the end, I was miserable but I held onto my hatred.

The years of fostering hatred and grudges peaked in high school where I enable to get into the Honors society by graduation. However, in college, there were no more bullies to fuel my hatred to drive me forward. I met people and tried to move on with my life but the lessons that I learned from these years of abuse stunted my growth. It took years for me to trust the people, I spoke with on an almost daily basis enough to call them my friends. I was unable to date because I could not believe that anyone liked me for me and I thought that they were only after my potential money. I was able to run into one of bullies, who tormented me during my teen years. I finally had an opportunity to get my long awaited revenge. For the first time, I had chance to be snug and proud told him, I was on my way to medical school. I was hoping that this would me my Made For TV moment and the culmination of my years of hate filled work to finally show my success to a bully and thus to everyone of them who tormented for years. His reaction was not what I expected, he just stated ""Oh, I always thought you were an idiot."" With that I wilted, I was my meek, weak, and broken self all over again. With one comment, he took away a dream, I had been nursing since I was nine \[I almost admire him for that\]. I stumble out a coy response and a nervous laugh then parted ways. In my head, I was left wondering what was it all for. I never did any hard work for me, it was to finally beat the bullies to show that I was the one on top. Every piece of media, I seen or read, promised me that day would come. When that one moment for sweet satisfying vengeance, that I wished for almost  entire life, it turned to ashes. I was the one who left to sulk away, I was only feeling as bitter as ever. Worst of all, my hatred was the only thing, but now with nothing left to feed it except for past memories that no longer held the same value. This creation of my own making, which helped me travel this far in life, turned on me. It was at this point that I started to completely unravel.

I knew that for the longest time that the person, I secretly hated more than anyone was myself and it intensified in medical school. In medical school, I no longer had my college friends as they had their own lives and goals to deal with so I was isolated again. I was no longer able to study and all I saw memories of my past self: my faults, my failures, and my misdeeds. After years of putting it off, I finally sought treatment. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and anxiety but my medications never helped to be me to be happy or improve memory to what it was before. At one point, I begged one of my psychiatrist to try electroconvulsive therapy as it was the only treatment, I had never tried. Due to my medical background, I knew that it had a relatively high chance of working but he refused due to the risks. In regards to my education, college resulted in lower social stress but my academic stress intensified. I was only able to maintain high enough grades in medical school not be held back but I was starting to burn out. I honestly barely passed medical school but that was only due to it being a pass/fail system. When it came to the first licensing exam, I forgot almost everything from my first two years of medical school so I spent the next 3 months struggling to relearn it all again with only a marginally passing grade to show for. I did terribly on the hospital floor where I had to describe my patient, to the other students, the residents, and the attending who graded me. I was forced to speak with my weak voice on the chaotic hospital floor with all eyes staring at me. In my mind, I believed that they all wanted and expected me to fail. Each new speciality, I had to rotate with, in order to graduate had aspects at it that I always found difficult especially with regards to speaking. I did not believe I could make and forced myself to stay back one more year, than I needed to, in order to prepare which I never believed, I fully was. I was able to find employment with a major hospital across the country and of course, I feel apart. I could not speak, remember, or do anything right. After one year, I was let go which in medicine is rare and huge black mark if I wanted to continue. I tried to go through the process to find employment again but failed to find any. I went on the interviews and used the last of the money, I had saved to fly to each of them. Now, I was drinking more alcohol than I ever had in my life as well as gave away everything, I had, in order to travel light. I started the long drive, home defeated. This entire time, I saw those memories of my bullies, and started to believe that they were right. I was desperate to find to root cause of all my failures up to this point and believed it was due to my voice. I test different ways to make it loud and come off more forceful but it was always weak which brought to where I was at the beginning.

I had an epiphany as I read my words back to myself. My bullies took a lot from me but I gave it to them. I allowed them to dictate how I lived my life for decades. From the moment, I believed that staying quiet and not doing anything to draw their attention, they were then able to mold everything, good or bad about myself. I paid careful attention to anything could criticize me in order to be normal in their eyes which never came. My voice embodied that I kept my mouth closed and barely said anything to the point, my vocal cords became weak from this disuse. I did everything, I could to please them and nothing for myself. Accredited everything, I did, to them, my mistakes, my faults and even my successes which I led me to believe that I had no accomplishments of my own. So after writing this all down, I did what I believed to be the best job of reading it, I submitted before I could second guess my decision and let go of those hate - filled memories. I then let whatever happened next happen so I could move on and reclaim my life."
380,My daughter is being bullied,10,dsdt0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dsdt0i/my_daughter_is_being_bullied/,6,1573060175.0,"My daughter is being bullied( more outcasted ) at school. She is 7 and never complained of it. Her teacher called and said she is withdrawing herself from lunch and recess and wants to put her into a social skills group once a week. The thing is my daughter is the most outgoing kind and empathetic kid I know..so why must she learn skills not the kids singling her out? We moved here in July and she made friends right away..when school came..she said she made friends. Today when I asked why she hadn't mentioned it she said she didn't want me to be sad for her or worried. I asked what happens and she got teary eyed and said ""I just don't know why they dont wanna play with me or talk to me, I dont know what I did wrong"" 
I'm devastated. Any advice is welcomed."
381,My bullies get creepier with each passing day,9,d3swej,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/d3swej/my_bullies_get_creepier_with_each_passing_day/,3,1568425760.0,"So hi there and thanks for reading this weird story.
I've been bullied every school year. You might ask yourself if I even went to teachers or the principal. Yes, I did go to every teacher. Yes, I did go to the principal. But once I always did that, my class always turned against me and my current one does too. So my bullies from this year went with me in the same class last year. I had many bullies last year and most of them are gone now. Thank god. I even hit one in the face accidently in gym class but that's another story for later maybe. I have four girls in my class who bully me, I also have to say it's just now the 2nd week of school, the 2nd one. I started a bullying diary to have prove that I get bullied, because everyone said that I was the one lying all the time and said I always feel attacked and that I'm too sensitive. I basically write down in that diary which person was involved, which time it happened and what happened. I hope some of you can use this little tipp, it helped someone a lot that I know. But back to the main story. I had two days ago my german class, and 10 minutes before it endes I asked my teacher if I may use the bathroom. Once I got out of class for a few minutes, two of my bullies left the class, one tries to stop me but I just went to the bathroom and did my business. I heard them enter the bathroom and they were standing in front of the stall I was using, eavesdropping on me while I did my business and just bursted out in laughter. I don't know what was so funny but it wasn't funny, at all. Once I got back to class, the bitch gang talked to each other, laughing and looking at me. After the class ended it sounded like they told the class next to mine what happened. My mother comes to school next week to talk with my principal (who did nothing against the bullying last year which almost pushed me to almost kill myself). If he doesn't do anything, she'll talk with the school inspector. If they do nothing, we go to the police. I also hope so badly that one certain bully gets thrown from the school, we were former best friends as kids but after she sexually assaulted me and touched me against my will, I just want her gone. It's hard to look her five days for up to 8 hours in the face. If you have experienced any kind of bullying, how did you handle it? I would be very grateful for every tipp. And thank you again for reading. It means a lot to me."
382,To the point where I cant do anything.,8,cxcmqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cxcmqg/to_the_point_where_i_cant_do_anything/,5,1567171954.0,"So, a bit of background. I'm 13, a female and have a therapist, I hurt myself in many ways.

This all started back in year 7, ( 6th Grade ) I always didnt pay attention in class, drawing etc. The popular girls didnt like me, always pointing out how my Uniform was scruffy and dirty. ( It wasnt, it was always neat and tidy. ) I didn't do much with my hair either, even though I washed it alot. They insulted my bag, my drawings, everything I did they insulted. To where I snapped one time, calling one of them a bitch and telling them that I'm not the one wearing 100 pounds of makeup on my face. And this really fucking started the harassment. They called me out to a fight, and since I live near them and I have to walk home, they caught up to me. I tried to walk home, ignoring them. But they didnt like that. Grabbing me by the head and bashing my head against a car, pulling and ripping my hair and throwing me to the floor. They left me as I walked home. Tears in my eyes. I never told anyone. And in Year 8 it got 'worse'. Everytime I went outside to hangout with my friends during lunch, people poured their food and drinks on me. Of course I reported them to the teacher. And NONE of them did anything. I cant move schools, I've already told my parents. They cant do shit. I've started to bite my wrists and knuckles to the point where they bleed badly, I have scars all over my hands. I have a therapist but I rarely go. I have to wear gloves at home to stop myself from biting my hands. I just dont know what to do anymore. I'm lost, I'm broken. I have nothing else."
383,Was it just my school?,8,cuqq6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cuqq6m/was_it_just_my_school/,3,1566662824.0,"So looking back now I've been out of highschool for 5 years. But did anyone else's school have like a ""anti bully task force"" or something? And the ironic thing was that it was made up of all the bullies in your school. And it sucked because they were all super close to the teachers and staff so you couldn't say anything and if you dared to disrupt the hierarchy then people would say you were making things up or just being a pussy?"

I started to reflect on the causes of my problems and alot of them are rooted back to long term bullying, which started at a very young age and spanned across different schools. Ill break this small story into 2 parts since i don't have much time to type. If people enjoy this small ready ill end up posting part 2 which covers my senior year into my adult hood.

The moral of the story will be concluded in part 2....

**CAUTION: BAD GRAMMAR**

**EDIT:** This covers my early years of school to 11th grade and im only highlighting the parts i remember. I was bullied alot but these r the points that stand out most. I will try to keep this as short as possible without going into too much details.

\*this will ***NOT*** contain names of people or places to help keep things safe

I grew up really poor since my parents were young so we were always bouncing around like gypsies. The first school i attended was a very preppy sports oriented school, which i was involved with. Of course, i wasn't like the other kids. Instead of foaming at the mouth about the Emmet Smith and the Dallas Cowboys, or being jittery about how the Chicago Bulls will be dominant in the NBA. I was more into nerd things like Star Wars, Warhammer, MTG etc etc. BUT! I was a really big hockey fan in which no one in school knew anything about for some reason \*/shrug

The bullying started around 4th grade where the kids would mess with my lunch pouring milk on my food, or begin targeting me at the play ground during recess . Around that time i had no friends and i was very shy kid, so i was an easy target. Fast forward to 6th grade was when it got really bad. Kids were actually starting to fight me, slap books out of my hands, or tackle me into lockers. I even had an incident where kids would bring in grill starters and purposely shock me during class, sometimes there was this student in my history class who would turn to his side and donkey kid me right out of my seat causing my to fly out of it.

With all this going on, i did open up to teachers and tell them what was happening. 95% of the time i was ignored. Sometimes i would even get snarky comments from teachers like "" Well maybe you deserved it? "" or the holy grail of adult logic "" its just a phase, they will grow out of it.""My parents would constantly be in contact with the school and the bullying would only get worst. It got to the point where my parents were so fed up we ended up moving to another school district around my 6th grade year. By that time, I still had no friends, wouldn't talk to anyone, but... i still competed in sports such as football since to me it was a good way to let out some aggression. 

6th grade was the year that i ended up failing. I remember specifically one of my 6th grade teachers asking me if i was ""autistic."" That school year i had no motivation to do school work, go to school, or even try. I was at a really low moral point that i just didn't care anymore since my day schedule consisted me of being belittled.

The problem with that year, was that even my little brother had the same bullying issues and we both ended up failing the same year. My parents had enough of it and after countless meetings, changes, nothing the school did really worked nor (from my point) did it seem they cared, since the police were never involved in the bullying. With that said my parents ended picking up house and moving to a new area.

These were the years when i started to notice about my emotional state and how things got worst. My first day of school was really awkward for me. Alot of the kid approached me, being curious and wanting to talk. Even the teachers were pretty nice compared to the ones i was use too. Repeating 6th grade again didn't seem all that bad there. I started making some new friends that also had same interest in nerd stuff especially anime, like the regular stuff on toonami on cartoon network. I was invited to alot of my new friends houses where we would sit around and play video games all the time. I couldn't believe the difference between the two school communities There was even a 7th grade girl who was interested in me, who was a field hockey player, it was really taboo for a sporty chick to be into a nerd around those times. She would sneak in those typical cute notes that were so popular to me when she passed me in hallway or at lunch.

We eventually started to hang out and i ended up visiting her place, her parents were super nice farmer type people. Her parents allowed us to hang out in her room if the door was open, long an behold she was a nerd as well. I remember seeing sailor moon posters on her wall mixed in with field hockey stuff and school merch. Come to find out she was really into the same stuff i was, and her older brother was a senior i believe and was going to college, who also was into anime and gaming as well. I was honestly so happy i could die.

A few months in the relationship with me an the girl got pretty serious as we started attending school dances, we went to each others sporting events, yes i was still playing football at this time. Some of the popular kids didnt like the idea of us hanging out so it caused some problems but i tried to ignore it. This all came to the end in early-mid-spring where she had the bright idea of going into the closet with me, and you could imagine things got spicy.  Her mom eventually caught us with both our shirts off kissing in the closet and oh boy i didnt hear that last of that, while her mom was on the phone with my parents she was crying on the couch and i was just sitting there confused. Her older brother walked down because he herd the commotion. The mother didn't want us seeing each other again, so before my parents came to get me her older brother came down with a VHS set. He said he should give them to me but since he was leaving he wanted me to have his prized possession. After i went home i tried to call the girl which the phone would get picked up and hung up right away. This event pretty much threw me into  a new depression. I looked into the box of her brother gave me and i notice the VHS were labeled in order 1-26 of an anime called Neon Genesis Evangelion, with an extra tape labeled End of Evangelion with a sticky note that said, watch last.

Returning back to shcool was a nightmare. I started to get snarky remarks from students calling me a pervert. Apparently the mom had such a meltdown she started gossiping to other kids moms about it. The girl i use to hang out with looked really upset but every time i approached her friends would screech insanity at me, i was even screamed at being called a ""panty-snatcher"" like really? Alot of the kids starting picking up on the situation and all the rude comments started to get worst. I started to fall down into a downward spiral after this. Few weeks later a few kids even started shoving me like back in the old school and i tried to ignore it but that only made it worst. I started to fight back and of course, i was the one getting in trouble. I started to settle with that this was destined to happen so it continued during the school year. I eventually stopped hanging out with friends since i started to fight with them as well.

At this point i was ready to give up. During this time around my birthday, i stayed home from school for a week without my parents knowing since they worked early. I popped in the VHS tapes of Evangelion  i was given. This anime literally through me into a deeper mind of depression i could ever imagine, and the movie to end it really opend my mind. My first year at the new school started so good, but everything started tumbling down near the end. By the time summer came around i tried to keep up with old friends, who were starting to get into drugs.  Marijuana started to become a really bad problem. My so called friends i were making tried to get me to try but when i refused they actually respected my decision and never really pressured me into it. Mind you these people were pretty much older than i was an were also considered the social outcasts. During my 7th grade year i was mostly ignored by classmates, i even had someone come to me an say ""We wanted you to join our group of friends, but we ended up staying away recourse you became friends with those people.""

During my 7th grade i literally had enough of peoples shit and turned into a delinquent. When ever someone would try to bully me i would literally fight them with how fed up i was. The school did try to help me which i appreciated but i was so filled with anger i didnt know what to do with myself and football wasnt working. The bullying got worst since the kids knew they could get a reaction out of me since i was so bottled with rage. It got to the point where i couldn't container myself from kids messing with me during science due to them hitting me with the paper hornets with thumb tacks i dismissed myself into the hallway, and literally destroyed a water fountain. A kid in the hallway saw this and made a shitty comment to me and i saw red and beat the kid up where it took 2 teachers to get me off him. My parents were on me from there constantly, and the school was offering to give me a week of out of school, a week in school, and i would talk to the counselor consistently until the end of the school year. My last year of middle school continued with alot of fights due to kids provoking me and my parents literally giving up on me and it felt i had no one at that point. My so called friends were to busy doing drugs and all i had was football and anime to try an cope with my sanity.

When Highschool started, i had already built up a pretty bad reputation.  I was placed in an emotional support classroom with 6 others and wasn't allowed to leave unless it was for lunch, gym, and specials. Other students were gossiping and called it the  ""retard room."" I was really embarrassed to be in there and hated hearing it. Lunch time was pretty bad, alot of the upper class kids would mess with me constantly to try an fire me up, but we had staff inside the lunch rooms and it was pretty quick to be handled, but it was always relayed back to my teacher and she would always talk to me about it. She had a goal set up to where if i was a good boi she would allow me to start going to main course classes during the next marking period. So i basically sucked it up and agreed. The bullying actually started to get worst since the upperclass found out i had a thing back in the day with one of the popular girls. She would try to defend me but that only made things worst. Got to the point where they would throw food at me at lunch so i started to take lunch in my class room. Specials and gym class were not an issue my freshman year since it was mainly with my classmates an alot of them were pretty timid of me by this time since i fought back at their bullying.

During the summer for football camp we did 2-days. Meaning we practiced in the morning and evening. The bullying got pretty bad since i was always targeted out. Some of them use to grab 2 helmets and slam them as hard as they could on my helmet making me dazed and confused. This only fueled my fire more, since i ended up taking one of the spots as a defensive end, and upper clansman didn't like that at all. Some of the bullying got so bad, when i would come in the next day for camp people would sometimes fuck with my football gear, like throw a snake on me they brought in, or actually tackle me into my locker while getting dress. I had one incident where actually tried to dump chew spit on me and ended up missing and getting it all over my gear. There was always this one guy who would bring in boxing gloves, who was training to be a boxer in the capital... and try to box me and have other people try an box me. Of course, i would be forced at times but hey, cant win them all right?

My 10th grade year were such a rollar coaster ride for me. With majority of the football team always down my throat, some of the student body also started jumping on the band wagon. My teacher of the emotional support class room, by coincidence was the head coach for the field hockey players. So of course they would come in once in awhile and chat with her. The girl i dated back in middle school would eventually start coming in as a ""tutor"" and come in and talk to me once in awhile and would apologize to me alot for being ignorant. We eventually tried to work things out but once some of her friends and other jocks found out shit got worst for me. I was going back to lunch during this time and her friends and ex-bf would always mess with me. It got to the point where i eventually blew up. Her ex  came over and spit in my milk and laughed, at this point i had enough. I took my milk carton and smashed it into his face breaking his nose and giving him an orbital sky fracture. His friends tried to jump me but teachers were all over it with the lunch room going nuts about it. I was eventually kicked off the football team and given 2 weeks suspension. My parents were furious.

Cops were involved but since they had camera footage and saw it was provoked they dropped the charges but the school tried to press but the police said that i was basically defending myself. The kids friends would then start taunting me out of school by egging my house or throwing chocolate syrup on my windows at night. One of the kids even came to my house to fight me. I was just sitting on my porch playing pokemon gold minding my own business when he rolled up in his car with his friends. I walked up to his window to just tell him to leave. Of course, typical teenager he started calling me names and bragging about taking my mom on a date, which didn't phase me because at this point i just didnt care anymore. I started walking away when he siad ""Cant wait to see you back in your retard room""... this is what made me snapped. I went back to his window and asked what he said and he repeated himself, this is where shit got messy. I told him to get out of his car and say it to my face and he siad something along that made me snap. I literally ripped him out of his driver car seat since he wasn't wearing a seat belt and started beating him down, he couldn't even stand how senseless is was beating him, his friends got us separated and they peeled off into the distance. The cops later came by and i had to go down to the station to be questioned with the kid i just beat up.

The kids father was there an he was pretty mad, he asked me how old i was and i said  16, the father started laughing and he straight up smacked his son up side the head as the cop watched the father explained his son is 19. So of course, cop didn't issue charges since they said he would have to live with the thought of getting beat up by a kid for rest of his life.

Countless nights spent crying over how people bullied me and how I didn’t do anything! I’ve been bullied from 8th grade-9th(now). I’ll now explain what people have done to me. 

8th grade- Someone had called me names such as “pussy” and “retard” everyday until I cried. He also took embarrassing videos of me and threatened to show it to the teachers if I told on him. I was crying for about 3 months and I didn’t do a thing.

9th grade- My whole class makes fun of me using racist names 30-40 times a day. I cannot tell on my whole class. I have light brown skin and people have said “Go away black person many times a day.” Whenever slavery comes up in our class my whole class starts laughing at me. I feel so depressed and cry at night. I have friends but they also say racist things to me. These are some names my class and my group say to me “n word”(I’m not african) “slave” “blackie” “thief go away” “your shit” “you have no rights” those are just some of the things they say to me everyday. I have been depressed many times. Teachers have already heard this racism and they’ve had many chats about this to my grade. It just makes the kids do more racist stuff. I have 1 good friend that understands me and that is the only thing that 
keeps me sane.  All my other friends can be nice but also really racist. I have asked them to stop but they just say it’s a joke and they carry on. I’m thinking of switching schools, but I will not know anyone there.

I don’t know what to do, teachers have talked to my grade about it and I’ve told them to stop. At this point I can only switch to another school.

What do you guys think about this whole situation. 

P.S I know this is a lot of writing, but I just poured my emotions and experiences with bullying onto this one post. I haven’t told anyone but my 1 friend and my parents about this.

P.P.S In my old school 6th grade and stuff I didn’t get bullied but In fact I was one of the kids who had a lot of friends and people liked, so I think I’m being bullied cause I’m not white/cacausian."

They give in and do anything to get accepted instead of telling him to fuck off. He  gets them to all take turns roasting  on each other and he controls everything. They won't bully him and instead turn into a gang.

I can feel the bad energy and insecurity around all of them. They're too afraid to stand up to the bully and instead act like his little bitches. They go around repeating everything he says. So if he calls you gay they all call you gay. If the bully wants to steal your money they all try to steal it.  They're all weak so I'm not afraid of them but he's manipulated them pretty bad."

In middle school, he started giving the outcasts wedgies and stuff like that. In high school, he started randomly beating up the outcasts. The school did nothing about it, and it hurt their reputation forever.

2 years later, I'm visiting my parents during study break in college (this was about 2 years ago). I flip the channel to the news and see a news report about someone who'd been beaten to death in a cornfield about half an hour away from my home.

Sure enough, it was that bully. He got sentenced to 55 years, but his sentence was reduced when they found out the victim was falsely presumed dead in the hospital. The victim, who was an old friend of mine and one of the bully's main bullying targets, pressed charges against the bully.

In the aftermath, the victim made a full physical recovery, but never mentally and emotionally fully recovered.

Edit: I just got news that the bully committed suicide in his stall after stealing a police officer's gun. The victim had no hard feelings for the bully's death and was actually glad he was dead. Me and the victim still chat, but not often, as I often don't have time as I am a pilot and am often too busy to chat.

I'm new here, so, I'm not sure if this story is appropriate for this sub... but here we go.

It is about agressive children that never received any consequences for their actions from the side of their parents or someone else.

Well, I'm Russian (currently living in Spain for almost 5 years, studying), so English is not my first language. Sorry for the mistakes and stuff.

So, a little context. In Russia, we don't have the same school system as all around the world. We have 1st to 9th grade years (like, primary and secondary together), and then you can go to college or stay at school for 10-11 grade and then go to the university or something.

Well, the story begins in the 3rd grade. I was studying in a private school, since my parents (absolutely love these guys, even though we had our misunderstandings sometimes) wanted to give me a better education there was. Oh boy, how little they knew.

So, the school I was in was pretty expensive, and there were only about 5 children in the class, with one teacher supervising us. My parents were giving all their money so I could study there, and the rest of the kids were or a little spoiled, or just had been kicked out of all other schools they could go. The first two years went pretty fine. I didn't have friends there or something, but it was... passable. The teacher responsible for our class was a nice woman in her late 20s, she was preventing any conflicts and such. In that year, the govt made some school reforms, so the teachers got paid more in public schools, and she had left, along with some other good ones. And here it when the fun begun.

With the teachers, some of ""normal"" and non-agressive kids had also gone, so, they had to reorganize the classes and i didn't really know anyone there, because I never was a conflict person and that kids were cleary just waiting for their moment. I was like 8-9 years old at the time. Our new teacher just didn't give a shit about us, and left us alone as soon as the classes were over (it was like a whole day school, so parents dropped us there in the morning and picked up about 9pm). And so, it went crazy.

There was one boy, named Julian or something, who were spoiled as heck. Stealing other's stuff, beating people up just because ""they're screaming is so much fun"", etc. He also had a huge palms, so the normal greeting from him was to receive one of them right on your back with a nice SLAP sound. Another one were a girl, Alice, who... let's say, she just had her anger management issues. There also were two more children in the class, but they have always remained as silent as possible, and I don't even remember their names or their faces or even if they were a boy or a girl. And me, if course, in the middle, a bright smiling optimistic little sun, who always wanted to make friends with literally everyone, to hug them and reassure that everything will be okay.

Well, those two kids (Julian and Alice) had all their attention towards me. I can't even count how many times I was beaten up by them. Oh boy, if you think you've heard enough about bullying, you're fucking _wrong_.

During that year, I left the school with new bruises every single day, especially on my back and ribs, after some ""friendly conversations"" with them two, and lots of nail scratches on my arms.
In winter, when everyone got to play outside instead of the PE class, we had a sleigh for a little snow mountain in the yard. It was made of metal, and some detail was sticking up. So, when it was my turn, to pick up the sleigh, I got pushed on the back and fell on it with my face, just half an inch away from my left eye. 
The same year, I've got in various fights with them. The most brutal ones were when Alice had cut my cheek deeply with her fingernails (I've responded bumping her head of the table) and her attempt to bite me. The milk tooth stuck in the wound and got ripped out. I've tried to cry for help or respond to her, but I was just laughing so hard i couldn't.
Also, in the evening, when the homework was done, the teachers tried to entertain us with some arty-crafty stiff, like drawings, knitting etc. And oh boy, my ""favorite"" was the embroidery class. I can't even count all the times when I had to get the embroidery needles (you know, ones with the roud end, so the children wouldn't hurt themselves) out of various parts of my body. The same with compass needles on geometry.
I also was thrown out the window a couple of times (we were on the second floor(the first being the ground) and it did really hurt) and off the stairs. I have broken my thumb on the right hand, my right wrist, had a fractured bone and even almost twisted neck (I've got a high intracranial pressure untill now).

I've learned to protect myself, so those kids in very rarely occasions got out without some damage, but still, it were 2vs1 combats, one of them being a girl with very freaking sharp nails, and other a boy 3 or 4 years older then me (you know, all the repeating the class because of grades thing). The teachers didn't give a FUCK about what was happening. My parents tried to talk with other's kids parents, always getting the answers like ""they are just kids, let them plAy"" or ""my precious flower would never do something like that, how dare you accuse my child for attempting murdering yours"".

A little note, that there really was not much my parents could have done. It's illegal in Russia to get your kid out off the school before the end of the year, as well as homeschooling. And the police... well, just lets say there isn't one. There also weren't any security cameras or something, and because there were a very few children in the whole school, it was easy to find a place without any witnesses. And I really don't know why, but I was always trying to hide my bruises and other things from my parents, because I was thinking that it was a wickness of my, even they never had told me so. And once again, the stuff didn't give a fUck. 

Needles to say, I've changed the school as early as I could, but still have a lot of mental issues and A FREAKING LOT of scars and poorly cured bones, that hurt until today. Like, the first thing I did when I got to a new school, was beat all the living shit out of my new classmates, so they wouldn't even THINK to hurt me (because, you know, when you were hardly surviving with 5 children in the class, and there are 30 of them now... I panicked xd)
My parents gave me a lot of emotional support to help me to adapt myself to my ""new and improved life"" where nobody wants to kill me. But until today, I'm freaking out sometimes when somebody attempts to sneak on me from behind or gets too close, or I can overreact to the people that are grabbing my things without a permission or trying to hug me even if I don't know them that well. I's a bit hard in Spain, where all the people are very friendly and the hugging and kissing strangers thing is in their culture... but I'm woking with myself, and have some very supportive and carrying friends with me to help as well)

I've just finished my first university year in programming engineering in one of the best places in all spain, I've managed to get good grades at school here, and... I'm pretty happy with my life now. The scars look awful though, and my fractured bones hurt a lot sometimes, but I've learned to be proud of them as reminders that I've survived)
I don't really know what had happened to that children after I've left. I've heard, that one of them got caught while shoplifting or something, so he might go to some sort of the children prison (don't know how are they called, sorry) , and the girl dropped the school to be a manicure master or something. I just hope that I'll never see them again in my life, and will never let my children suffer the school years as well as I did.

I actually have learned to take it with a bit of humor, and sometimes I can tell one or two of my stories joker-style and laugh about it. But... there is still a bit of panic inside me, when I'm left completely alone. I have a very hard time sometimes not to throw myself in tears when nobody is seeing me after a long day with friends or other people, because of the pressure. But... it's okay... I think...

Thank you all for your attention, and sorry for such a long post. I just needed to speak out all going in my life to someone.

Edit: In the beginning, I just wanted to complain a little and forget about this story, but now it's the night time, I'm staying in a flat with some other people and just trying not to cry myself to sleep, because some part of my subconscious just keeps saying me that I NEED a kitchen knife under my pillow to protect myself, ""just in case"". Over the years, I just keep getting anxiety attacks or something while I'm left alone with nobody I know and trust to. Maybe I need a psychologist or something? Or it will just go away at some point?
I don't really know, and also had a bad experience with the psychology and psychiatry at some time, but... may be I should give it another shot? Don't really know what to do, if you have some advice, I will be very grateful

Update: Thank you all for your support, I'm going through therapy now, and actually feeling a lot better about myself. Well, the shit never drowns, as we say in russa, so beneath that first layer of anxiety and depression there are more and more things, but I'm getting through)"

399,My life in high school as the victim,10,bqawd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bqawd4/my_life_in_high_school_as_the_victim/,4,1558254734.0,"Note: this is my first post on reddit and I needed to vent and I am typing on an iPad so I apologise in advance for spelling mistakes and this is going to be a veeeeeery long post so you don’t have to read.

Background: I am a high school student who has spent most of his life as a reserved individual who would rather watch movies and anime, read manga and play video games than hang out with friends. And I have Aspergers and I am regarded as the goody two shoes in school but was a bit unintelligent and quiet. I was the go to for bullying antics from all age ranges in high school.

I am from the UK so I will go by grade equivalents of the time I spent there so without further ado let’s get on with the story.

Year 7: I had just started high school and everything was going well until people started to form their friend groups where nasty kids from my primary school and others. This was one of the many trouble making gangs in my school. I was almost immediately a target of theirs for bullying they would constantly put me down, insult me, throw things at me and try to get me in trouble for no reason and take my stuff and throw it or hide it. A person who I once considered a friend joined them after year 8 but back to year 7. Anyway one particular incident really struck me. I was playing table tennis with a friend and when our ball went under the benches I bent down to get and suddenly the leader of these jerks went and poked my on the butthole. My parents immediately phoned the school and she got in trouble. Another incident was when some older kids tried to follow me everywhere and try and hug me to creep me out (I get very uncomfortable with being touched out of nowhere) so I hid in the toilets and one of the bullies recorded me telling them to go away as I was hiding and posted it on snapchat so my parents phoned the school and they were swiftly dealt with. One of Asperger habits includes the need to run around the school, I also had my arms behind by back like naruto and sonic so someone spread the nickname Op (me) bird arms which eventually died out.

Year 8: I started to stick up for myself more by coming up with witty comebacks and jokes and was a bit aggressive to the point where I was labelled as an animal (more specifically a Rottweiler) because whenever I got angry I would growl and throw anything they threw at me back and when I took my stuff back I scratched the kids arm by accident. Stuff was frequently thrown over the toilet doors to soak me or have me covered in food and the toilet door was rammed open (they didn’t nonce me they ran away and saw nothing). 

Year 9: almost the whole (friends and behaving kids exempted) started throwing stuff at me to the point where I punched one of them (I got away with and the bully got in trouble) and the same bully had an apple thrown at the back of their head so this person and her friends immediately started to blame me because they had been throwing stuff at me earlier (I didn’t do it) and when the culprit was found out they still blamed me every single lesson. Another student (female) pulled on my underwear as I was hanging out slightly. School was phoned again.
Things were thrown at me frequently in the changing rooms after p.e. To the point where my glasses broke slightly. Another student and I got into argument for a reason I can’t remember and roared and charged at me to scare me so I pushed him away and then he slapped me in the head and when we were called in by a teacher my story was believed but neither of us got in trouble so we were told to stay away from each other. Another incident where two kids tried to block me and my brother in the bathroom resulted in me and him pushing them out the way while one of them tried to pull my trousers down. They were both excluded for a while.

Year 10 my current and worst year: now this bully tried to humiliate me and make me miserable every time she saw me. She would frequently insult me, berate me and threaten me with sexual assault by getting the kid who touched my butt and saying she’d get her to do it again. Time and time again I stood up to all of them and insulted them back and when they threw stuff at me I would throw them back. Until one day the bully snapped and called her father. He waited for me outside the school in his car and threatened to rip my head off if I ever did anything to the bully again. The police were phone and he and the bully were put on warnings from the police.

Aftermath: I was terrified of school and left shaking and paralysed with fear after being threatened. Sometimes after different bullying events I would break down in tears in the toilets. All I felt was hatred for my bullies and I struggled and sort of still do with my self confidence and had major trust issues with strangers and people in general (outside my family) after being betrayed and hurt.

Luckily almost every time one of my friends or a group of friends and bystanders were behind me and stood up to all of my bullies and I am very lucky to have such people in my life and from the bottom of my heart I thank each and every one of them for everything they have done for me. I have regained some self confidence and have gotten better in school since these major incidents but from time to time I still get grief from people and I feel more hatred and sadness each time. But things really have been getting better, I even got my first A* on some thing and all my grades drastically raised from the bottom to higher grades.

I thank everyone who has supported and one day I hope everyone can go out in life and not have to worry about vile people like them. And one day I hope that I can be recognised in a positive light by everyone and find something I can be really passionate about and prove all of those people wrong.

And a note for anyone who is a bully, stop it it doesn’t make you cool, get your act together and apologise and help people instead.

And to anyone who has been bullied or anyone who is being bullied, there will always be someone out there who cares about you enough to help you, you are beautiful in your own unique way so don’t let other people bring you down because you are better than they are and you can do things that amaze people by being yourself, so believe in yourself and aim for the stars because I believe in you too.

And to the bystanders, for the sake of others please lend an ear to listen and a shoulder to cry on and please try and make someone’s life just that little bit brighter.

Also to end my story on a positive note all my major bullies have left school, been expelled or have been put in a position where they can’t bully me anymore, ones even being bullied now too and one in a boarding school and others have either given up on bullying or do it to other people but are foiled each time. Karma is a wonderful thing. Thank you for reading everyone."

I go and it's fine at first, awkward though because my German is very bad. One particular member (let's call him member A) orders a pretzel and tears it into pieces...about 10 minutes later, without thinking, I grab a piece and go to eat it, thinking that it was for public consumption....he then goes on a bit of a harsh tirade against me, asking if I'm some kind of social weirdo or something...I respond basically saying ""whoa dude chill out this is my first time here, I'm nervous and I thought the pretzel was for public consumption"". This happened during a conversation with member A and the group organizer (a very nice guy who then told us to calm down). After our little argument I basically said nothing for the next 10 minutes while they talk because I'm so overwhelmed with anger. I then throw the money I owe for my tab on the table, say my goodbyes, but then tell member A ""hey FUCK you"", in such a way so that the whole group was within earshot.

&#x200B;

I don't have much experience with bullying, so I wasn't sure how to react. Unfortunately because of my anger it wasn't a very nuanced reaction. Most importantly, **I don't know if I should go back to the group**. Going back seems like the best way to maintain my dignity, assuming of course I didn't burn any bridges with my theatrical exit. I'm crossing my fingers that he gets kicked out of the group, and I've considered messaging the organizers but that seems like tattling.

If anyone could weigh in on this, that would be great

tl:dr: got bullied for a silly mistake at a meetup group, I'm not sure how to handle the situation"

I’m working in a temp role for the past six months, which could go to permanent, and managed by a man in his 50’s. He’s very politically incorrect and for at least a    month has made comments or jokes about my weight e.g. ‘you look like a potato’,’ you block the sun’, ‘you make lots of noise on the stairs and disturbed our meeting’ etc. He was reading out an email and pretended that it said ‘you’re a fat bastard’ and I asked him to stop with fat comments and he said ok. This was the week after I was made fun of which made me decide I should ask him to  stop, so I was prepared for what to say.  It stopped for a week or so but today he has continued. He said not to eat all the birthday cake when it was hidden in our room and later  said that I’m watching my figure when another person recommended a brand of bread. 
These comments do affect my concentration and bothers me outside of working hours. Firstly, I suffer from mental health issues and I’m an emotional eater. It feels like someone is mocking my mental health and unhappiness, something which I could do without, as its bad enough with my own thoughts.

Bare in mind that he arranged  for me to leave after the first month and the office manager agreed, then only kept me on when I disclosed that I have dyspraxia. I feel I can’t upset him too much or provoke him because he could be a factor for the final decision on whether I’m kept on permanently. So my question - how should I deal with him to stop it from happening? I’ve already asked him once and today was tempted to say it again but had doubts and anxiety about saying it. The office manager is aware of some of the comments and said things like ‘ I don’t know how you put up with it’ but the reality is i act like I don’t seem bothered, but  I’m scared to provoke him as he manages me and may put in a bad word for me regarding going full time,  if I upset him by standing up to him."
403,My Story,9,bojezg,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bojezg/my_story/,10,1557871860.0,"I am on a phone sorry about the format

So my therapist told me I should write out feelings and a bunch more but i don’t want parents knowing so this is what I am doing instead. So this happened form K-3 and a quick warning this will be GRAPHIC and is what I consider pretty bad. Now also this happened about 11 or 10 years ago so not every detail will be exact and some will more than likely be exaggerated and I am in high school now so yeah don’t remember everything. Ok so from what I remember it started in kindergarten and at first this girl we will call sam just teased me calling me a freak a loser a plague and a freak a first I didn’t care and did nothing because I didn’t know what to do but soon it got worse she soon rallied around 30 girls to continue the abuse with more name calling but now beginning to get physical (pushing, more name calling so on). But it didn’t take long for them to kick it in to gear (ha pun intended). Soon every day when recess came around while we where walking out they would cover my mouth, restrain me and then proceeded to to beat, kick, cut and so so much more. The pain oh the pain was awful and I still have scars all over my body as a permanent reminder of “we did this to you and this is a hell you won’t escape from as long as we are around to make you hurt.” Sound fun right. Every day they would do that for 2 years and then something changed that day something happened. I blacked out and then woke up in the hospital ER. They had smashed my head repeatedly into a wall that day and from what I heard and could slightly understand I had a concussion and they fractured my skull. But at this point my parents wanted to know what happened but i was to scared to do anything I just told them I slipped and fell and hit the back of my head. And they believed it and I was discharged a couple weeks or days later (honestly I don’t remember). They day I got back it continued and well i was bleeding on my wrist/for arm just enough to where my hand was slippery and not easy to hold on to and I slipped out of their grasp for a few seconds. And I punched the little bitch. At first I think she was stunned but that stunned look didn’t last long and soon turn into a mocking hatred of rage and disappointment and I will remember her words of what she said for the rest of my life “No matter how hard you try no matter if you run no matter if you hide I will always find you and I will always make sure your never happy and are always suffering.” This continued for another year and I still don’t remember much but what do remember is that one day in class I had a teacher pull me out of class and ask me a question saying “ [OP] is someone hurting you and if they are who is it and where” and all I remember is looking at the teacher and crying while saying her name then point so a specific place underneath the waist line but above my legs (I am male by the way). All I remember is after a couple days the bullying stopped and she vanished halfway through the school year. I soon then got a medical test and went to therapy and counseling. When I got my medical test back I saw my mom just look at me with sadness and looking as if she wanted to cry and from what I heard I think she said I was unable to have children due to so much damage being done over such a long period of time. I am currently diagnosed with PTSD and panic attacks and a bunch more. But the moral of the story is tell people they need to know and will help you don’t be like me and make my mistakes. People are there to help you just make sure you reach out and say you need help first.


Also if people really want to know more I can edit it and tell you if people really want."
404,I want revenge on her,9,bhjw09,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bhjw09/i_want_revenge_on_her/,22,1556295421.0,"Ok so this kid has been bullying me for over a year and I don't even know why she hates me. We never even had a proper conversation. 

People tell me to ignore her and that's all I've been doing. But it didn't and still doesn't working. She gets into my head and messes up my day. This has been giving me suicidal thoughts like crazy every time I see or hear her I freeze and feel queazy.

She shouts out bitch for at least 4 times at me which normally catches me off guard and shouts out to class that I have no friends and when I made an announcement she went, "" oh is someone talking??""  Other than that she just talks behind my back. It's been bugging me for the past year.

People are afraid of her and I'm not sure why. I only told 1 teacher last year and the teacher said it was normal. I'm planning on going to tell a higher up teacher about this but in case this really doesn't work. 
I want revenge.

Just to make this clear, I want revenge that will not cause me to go to the principal's office or anything. 

JUST FOR INFO: I'm a quiet girl that switched to the school last year

EDIT: I've reported her and the teacher called her to speak privately (warn her) to say they're watching her. Honestly, I was scared that this would make the bullying worse for me... Weighing the odds if this works in my head every now and then but think it's better to wait and see how this turns out.

Also on the same day, there was a combined class with her in it and she made faces at me and mouthed bitch while I acted not to notice again. Yeah, this girl has no shame.

INFO ON HER: I overheard that she feels unfair at times that her little sister gets it easy. It was one of the few if not the only vulnerable moments I've seen from her.    

If there's anything that may help you help me, tell me.
It's not necessary to have revenge immaturely at all. Maybe not even revenge. Just something to do about this bully. All replies have my thanks."
405,Bully got what he deserved,10,be773x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/be773x/bully_got_what_he_deserved/,3,1555532934.0,"Now this story just happened to me and I’m fuming and sorry for misspellings english is my third language

A little back story this kid who we will call ah short for ASSHOLE was a chill kid respectable but when he got famous in our school he started to bully a lot of people me included, it had happened for a while and i am not a weak kid i can hurt someone and thats mainly why i don’t use force  unless i have to so he just found me not doing anything when I’m being pushed around and he saw an opportunity and he took it.

Now remember those kid who where pushing me around they are actually really good friends of mine and i love them to death and them pushing was just a joke and them just playing around and i was never angry at them so i just did not do anything.

About a month later AH comes up to me and proceeds to have a convo with me and this is how it went.

AH: hey what is your name you look like you are new around here?

Me: ehm...... im not new but whatever my name is (insert name here) how about you what is your name?

AH: oh okay my name is AH and next time when 
You are talking to me lower your voice ( now i was talking normally) 

Me: o....kay i guess.

AH: good

And this type of stuff went on for a while about a month or two so i decided im done with this shit (btw his “games” turned aggressive and he pushed me around and hitting me on the daily and i was done with that)

So today rolls up and im already have a bad day and this day he turned up late because he had to put his brother to the doctors because he had his broken so he arrived at 2nd period and he is in my class so i heard a lot of shit from him
So i just had enough today and of course he goes off on his bullying schedule and i was second but little did he know i had enough and was going to fight back and btw he is a bit shorter than me so i had that advantage so it my turn to get bullied and i just ignored him
Until he started punching my belly and im not fat or ripped im on the middle and i said to myself if he hits me one more fucking time i was going to put him to the ground and what did you know he did i was pissed i gave up on my respectable me and unleashed someone no one ever has seen and i pushed him away from me to a wall and then started shouting at him telling him if he dares to do this again i would have to actually knock him out and when i was done i took him by the head and threw him on the ground and he was pissed he got up and ran at me i just side stepped and pushed him will he was running at me and I directed him to the ground and there he was on the ground i felt somewhat proud that i did this and when he tried to get up again i just said don’t and just went away 

At the moment im going home and i have a feeling he is going to jump me tomorrow so thats something to prepare for anyway if anything happens i will be sure to post it because he is the saddest person i have ever seen"
406,Stories about reuniting with your former bully,9,bbepwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bbepwh/stories_about_reuniting_with_your_former_bully/,4,1554879909.0,"The other day I was in a restaurant with my mum and in the booth next to us sat the girl who used to bully me when I was fifteen. 

For context, this girl was a compulsive liar and the biggest drama queen. We were in the same drama club (I was in it for ten years but she was in it for three) and we used to be good friends. However, for months I’d noticed her controlling behaviour towards other girls so I distanced myself from her. When I was hired as a director for a musical I’d written myself, I didn’t give her the role she wanted. She was upset about it but I’d still given her a role that had a good amount of lines. 

That was when she decided to make my life a living hell. She told the producer that I was a maniacal bully, that I told her that she was so ugly that no boy would want, that I told her to go kill herself on multiple occasions. 

All of these were lies, of course. I told the producer that it wasn’t true, and despite having no evidence other than her word, I was suspended. She was eventually suspended too when it was revealed that all of it was a lie. However in that time, she’d message me saying things like “I hope you can find it in your heart to change your mind.” Even when she told the truth and said she’d made up the accusations about me, she told the entire group stuff like “I lied, it was for a good reason” and “If she could find it in her heart to forgive me and herself, then we can both move forward.” Eventually, we were both invited back, but I was too scared and upset to return. I left my childhood friends and my happy place because of her.

I saw her yesterday and it just felt really weird. I wasn’t jealous of her (if anything, I’m more content with my life now than it was at the drama club.) She looked happy too and according to her social media, she’s doing pretty well. A part of me wanted to know what her life was like, had she changed, what’s she doing now. Another part of me didn’t want to know and forget everything. But mostly, I was still terrified of her after all these years. I was afraid of even going up to the till to pay for my meal because I didn’t want to pass in front of her and for her to try and talk to me.

I was just wondering, does anybody else have stories like this? Have you ever seen or talked to your past bully? How did you feel?"

On the bus last year, people came up with rumors that I said that I was going to kill everybody, yet I didn’t. This year, they’ve started telling the new kids on the bus that I said that, and now, I’m being tormented about it. I’ve had things thrown at me, water poured on me, all on the bus. Another time on the bus, I was just on my phone when someone airdropped me a photo that says “no one loves you” which I didn’t mind, but the thing that got me is that they named their phone,”(my first AND last name) is going to be a school shooter”. Another event, in the locker room, in which a kid was calling me names based on my skinny body type, and kept on saying horrifying things about my mothers private’s. I asked him to stop and he didn’t. I finally took it up with the administrators, but all they did is get a teacher to talk to me and him while at our lockers(right next to each other) asking if he did this, and did that. I would’ve told them the truth, but I know they would literally just give him something like a log signing, and he would just continue to torment me, so I didn’t say anything. Why do they do this?"

I've tried pretty much all forms of self help but the bullying i received as a kid just never seems to stop shaping me. I thought talking about it might help.

When i was 3 my parents divorced, my dad cheated, and he was my hero, as usual in these cases i blamed myself for it, so there starts the self hate part.

In school i was a  quiet, shy and sensitive kid. I liked to read on breaks, and not really talked to anyone, which was ok for me. But it made me stand out, unfortunately, then the bullying started. They'd steal my books, burn them, punch me, pull my hair.. One of them broke my arms (both). They called me names, said i was ugly, weird, told me to kill myself, they forced me to do their homeworks. School did nothing, my mom did nothing... no one cared and now that i finally feel ok to talk about it everyone just says ""yeah thats fucked up but get over it it was all kid stuff"". BUT THAT HURTS SO MUCH. I still hate myself because of it, i still hurt myself because of it.. and knowing that no one cares again, even if its because its in the past just hurts so much more... i just want a justice that will never be achieved, i just want a ""i am sorry""that i know i""ll never hear.."

I made a long post about my bullying history [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9nyfl9/my_bullying_story/).

As of now, I am in a psychiatric facility. This is my Weekend at home. After 6 years of isolation, my dogs sickness combined with my mental injury from bullying led to a panic attack, after which Me and my Father agreed on calling Emergency Services.

It has been a weird 2 weeks. Starting off in a closed ward of the mental hospital, I was first evaluated as psychotic, given my paranoia, fear of others, social issues, etc..

I was moved to an open facility for mainly Psychotics and Schizophrenics, yet under further assessment, 2 psychologists independently put me into the PTSD/C-PTSD camp, especially after having front row seats to 2 sepperate emotional flashbacks, which were confirmed as such by a psychologist who worked years in a clinic for Borderline and PTSD cases.

I have pretty much most of the symptoms, the only question left is if I fulfill the A1/Cut-Off Criteria for having been sufficiently scared or threatened.....(whatever that is good for...especially with memory holes like mine)

For the first week, I behaved like someone would in prison, constantly on edge, constantly my back to the wall and my face towards the entries and exits. Then something new happened. I made friends. For the first time ever without lying about myself, boasting or playing a character. I am getting used to being in groups now. Among people.

I am still scared as fuck, and I have never been so emotionally unstable in my life (which even impressed one of my new friends, a Borderline-patient), I have started to self harm again to a point I am taught Skills, but yet, things are looking up. It's confirmed my suffering is real. I am finding friends. For the first time in years, I am glad to be alive. And I want to go on.

To everyone here doubting if bullying really is that bad, if they are defective for being broken up and destroyed about it, let me tell you, it is that bad. You were psychologically and/or physically tortured. You deserve to get help. You deserve to feel better. You have no blame in your destruction. But putting yourself back together, only you can do that. So use whatever resource available.

Every day afterschool I am picked up by a babysitter that takes care of my 13 year old brother from school, then we go to pick him up at his school, he is viscously bullied nearly every day for doing this people wouldn't consider normal. And I constantly hope I will see someone physically bullying him so I have a chance to deck them. And today was the day I got lucky, because my brother is where he usually is, in a small dried ravine digging for bugs and grubs next to where we pick him up, and I see a group of three children picking on him. As we pull up my brother sees us and I notice he is crying quietly, at this point I am already fairly angry so I get out and fast walk towards them while keeping a straight face with no visible anger. Once I get there I ask whats going on. One of the kids, which seemed to be the leader of the small group, said ""This retard is digging for some reason."" And at that point I would have decked him, but there was too many people around and I was not mad enough to not care about getting caught. So instead I tell him ""Fuck off before I deck you and your friends"" (I am similar size to these idiots even though I am much older, 17 years old, my brother is 5'3"" and much smaller than these kids) Right after I say this the leader of the group says ""What, you're protecting Autist boy?"" At this point I was enraged, they created a nickname for him which sounded like it had been used multiple times so I knew this wasn't a one time thing, so I went up to him and stared him down and told ""Get the fuck out of here before I deck you."" and he said ""Oh look autist boy, you're saved"" as sarcastic as possible. At this point I was done with their shit, so I stared him straight in the face, and decked him as hard as I possibly could, he fell to the ground with blood dripping everywhere. I told my brother ""Get in the car, we're leaving."" He's still crying but he goes and gets in. I look at his two bitches he obviously has wrapped under his finger and told them ""If I ever see you or your friend even talking to my brother again, I promise you I will smash both of your faces into a god damn tree."" We then both got in the car and drove off, the babysitter was obviously furious with me, screaming she was gonna tell my mother and that I was in big trouble. My brother on the other hand, was hugging me saying he loved me and couldn't be squeezing tighter. My mom grounded me for a year, and I haven't been able to type this up for three months as I only got my phone back yesterday. Moral of the story, don't fuck with my autistic brother or call him autistic as an insult."

Background: I'm a graduate student with a full business experience resume behind me and a relationship with my SO whom I absolutely adore.

So, why is this getting to me so terribly?

Last year, my cohort had a girl who wasn't a team player. I hate to say it but, in order to fit in, I was included in the offense against her; Mostly it was giving her the silent treatment or texting each other about her behaviour. In retrospect, it was petty, but she was also actively sabotaging and copying people's work (So much that the professors saw it and she was kicked out of the program after 1 semester). Everything was ok, until right before spring finals when I started to notice that I was beginning to be treated in the same way. I've wracked my brains to figure out what/if I said or done something offensive. I even approached the group and asked on account that I would like to apologize and watch my behavior in the future. One person remained silent, staring at her laptop; one person walked away from me; the third took a breath and then said ""No, nothing's wrong. Don't worry about it!"" 2 days later, they announced to the professor they had all completed an assignment together, which was meant to be a group effort. When the professor looked at me and asked where mine was, I was stunned silent. No one had texted/emailed/called or in anyway notified me they were getting together. When I asked why after class, I got the exact same treatment from each of them.

This year has been much of the same. Last semester I got the silent treatment and, sometimes, verbally shot down in my opinions during class discussions. I think they expected me to quit or fail (instead I had doubled down, kept to myself and made straight A's without their help), which is probably why this semester has been even worse. It's no longer a 'silent-treatment' but an outright assault of ""Go Away. We don't want you here."" They make loud offers to go to lunch together, purposely so I know I'm not invited. When I speak, they smirk/roll their eyes/whisper in loud voices mocking me. It was so bad, I went to the professor \*3 Days\* into the first week of spring semester. He hadn't noticed ANYTHING and was 'shocked' to hear they were acting this way. He just thought I had preferred to work alone. I asked him not to get involved (why force them to get along with me?) and notified him that he needed to know in case there were any group projects assigned this semester.

At this point, I'm just sticking to my M.O. of keeping my head down, doing the work and getting through each day. Sometimes I wish I HAD actually done something terrible, just so I can understand their justification. Sometimes I think about confronting them a third time. Sometimes I just wish they'd leave me alone entirely and deal with things like adults. The point is: There will always be people who, for whatever reason, want to make you feel small, isolated and alone (for reasons I'll probably never understand.)

&#x200B;

tl:dr Bullying still happens in your 30s, when you are 'supposed' to be more mature and understanding of things. It's mentally draining to have surpassed this kind of behavior after middle school and high school only to suddenly feel like you are back in the 7th grade being teased because you're different than everyone else and setup to fail by your classmates. Today is hard, and I'm just trying to get through it."

This was kindergarten.  Probably because she is the tallest. At 4'7 1/2 she is the tallest child in about 3 grade levels. Now she's in first grade. Her best friend calls her fat and gay, shes 7. I no longer allow play dates with the child and encourage her to spend more time with her cousins. She hates school already and talks about death. I always let her know that it would hurt me and not to speak on things like that. On December 10, she came home and said someone spilled milk on her and her teacher did absolutely nothing. I dont what to do? I read these stories of little kids killing themselves, so I smother her with love while shes at school. She has no friends at the school. She desperately wants to fit in, but she likes bugs, pokemon, superhero movies. I guess maybe 7 year old girls dont like these things. I just want to cry when she comes home in tears.

414,Honouring a Friend who died 25 years ago today. trigger warning about bullying.,10,a4y28q,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/a4y28q/honouring_a_friend_who_died_25_years_ago_today/,3,1544494003.0,"Today marks 25 years since I lost a friend to complications of AIDS.   Here is my friend's story in a nutshell.   He was attending a Catholic school in the outskirts of Toronto (so not the school getting media attention right now).  My friend was gay and had speech and hearing issues.     He was repeatedly bullied and hazed for being gay and having a visible disability.   He was a gentle soul.   He was kind to people, animals and everyone.   My parents got to meet him and loved him.   He tried to endure the bullying and would just go out and dance at night clubs was the only place he could hear and feel the music (he wasn't totally deaf).   
Anyway, one day a group of about 8 boys got him in the locker room...and did things to him....bad things.   He was so ashamed and couldn't cope.    While he was gay he didn't get HIV from sex, he got it from drugs.  He ran away from home.  When he got sick he went back home and his parents looked after him.  His mom was heart-broken, he was too ashamed to tell them how severe the bullying was.  At least I am comforted knowing that he was believed by his parents, was nursed at home till his dying day by his loving parents and sisters, had his friends visit and call and was given a respectful funeral in a Catholic church which gave his parents much comfort.

However, no justice was served by his tormentors.  They are out there having lives, maybe forgetting what they did.  Or thinking it was no big deal.  They might have spouses, kids, homes, jobs, respect in their community and it makes me sick.   The recent news is very disturbing but at least schools and parents and communities are listening.   There is progress but one ruined life is one too many.   

Please, if you are being bullied right now tell someone!   There is help!

R.I.P. my gentle friend...you will never be forgotten.

415,There's nobody to talk to.,8,9yydb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9yydb8/theres_nobody_to_talk_to/,5,1542790961.0,"*long*

Being the comedian of the group is so hard. None of them truly know you or what you've been through. They don't suspect someone like you to have gone through something like that. I honestly don't know what I'm doing right now. I just now joined this amino because I've realized there's nobody else for me to talk to. 

You know how there are things you never tell anybody because you want to preserve your reputation or the scrap of dignity you have left? I suppose I can use the anonymity of the Internet to get it all out. 

My life up until now has been... Awful. 
I'm not looking to compare my experience to others' or make it a competition. But it hasn't been pleasant. My parents are extremely intelligent, with strict standards for how I should act. I could read by three, and I knew a lot of the things being taught in kindergarten. Because of that, I'd finish work quickly. Being a five year old, I'd get up to look out the window out of boredom and I'd often get in trouble. 

I suppose my classmates got a kick out of seeing me get in trouble, and since then they'd try to find other ways to bring me down. It was all verbal until second and third grade. Kids can be so amazingly cruel, and you can only explain so much bullying with ""I tripped."" 

They held me down, grabbed my hand, and put a handheld pencil sharpener on my fingers. 
Twisting it while I screamed. Covering my mouth so the teachers couldn't hear. 
""I just cut myself when I fell in the wood chips.""
Such an obvious lie, but the teachers ate it up. 

They'd tie me up with the jump ropes and whip me with them until my limbs were red. Sometimes they just shoved me in a corner and beat me up the old fashioned way. 
I was avoided like a leper. 
Picked last in P.E. 
Asked out as a joke.
""Who could ask out a girl as ugly as her?""

It's amazing how horrible adults can be. The students actively tried to damage my reputation by collectively telling lies about me to the teacher, coining me as violent and a thief. 
I guess that's why none of the teachers tried to help me on that field trip. The one where they shoved me to the floor while I was roller skating and I broke my knee. How could they ignore a crying nine year old lying there? 

I was sobbing one day in the gym in my school's after school program. A teacher came up to me. 
""Could you maybe not cry? It doesn't look good on us when our students are bawling so loudly.""
I cried harder. 

I remember my head being forced between two bars on the playground. I remember being trapped and left outside in the rain for an hour before I was found. 

My glasses were stolen and hidden. They kicked me around and stepped on me while I crawled helplessly, struggling to find my way around. 

I broke fingers blocking basketballs with far too much air pumped into them from colliding with my face. They threw them far harder than I thought a kid could. God forbid I go home with broken glasses. 

The popular girls at camp didn't like being stood up to. Apparently when you don't do what they say they force your head underwater in a pool in an attempt to drown you. Finally the incompetent lifeguard noticed something off about a group of girls in a huddle with splashing in the center. Took him long enough. 

My parents are strict. Proud. 
""We didn't raise a pussy.""
""Washingtons don't get bullied."" 
How could I tell them time and time again what a disappointment I was for being bullied? 
How could I tell my teachers when they believe I'm a problem child thanks to my peers?

Middle school.
The sexual harassment was unreal. Packed hallways where someone could grope you and you'd never see their face. 

I just remember the hands sliding under my shirt or yanking my hips. The rough hands forcing me against a wall and fondling me where nobody can see. 

Someone I thought was my friend cornering me when nobody was around and putting their hands on me. Continuing after I told them to stop. Stop. Stop. Please. 

It's like you're suffocating. 
It's like you're hyperventilating and all you're aware of is that your back is against the wall and there's nobody around and that their hands shouldn't be where they're at and you can't make them stop. 

And then they tell everyone you asked for it. 
What a whore you are. 
Then come the whispers and people asking you if you'd prefer two or three fingers. 

There's no escape. It's still happening. I can't do this anymore. Why me? I hate how weak I am. I hate that this is happening to me. I hate that I couldn't do anything about it. 

I wish the things listed were all that happened. I wish they were the worst that happened. 

People don't understand. They can't understand unless they know how it feels. I just want to be happy. I want to be loved and to feel loved. These friends. 
They keep me around for laughs. 
They have no idea. I doubt they'd care if they did."

Someone on a discord server suggested that I get in touch with someone she knows and ask them to ask her to take it down, so I did recently, but now they're replying to my reddit posts (on my main account) saying that I harass people and stuff.

And someone else that read what he wrote, said on Reddit: ""I've taken a look through posts from this person. I've seen people who have been harassed by this person. This person does this constantly, then makes new accounts when people call him out on his shit. Don't feed into it, literally just ignore it. I'm posting this here since someone else hasn't said it on this post, and it needs to be said. Don't feed into his harassment, his alcoholism, his attention seeking behavior."" 

People offline like me and say I'm a gentlemen and stuff.  I have no friends though.

I just want a chance to make YouTube videos.

I already stopped drawing when people on a discord server made fun of my art, and on a writing site they said there's two types of people, those with talent and those without it and they said that without a doubt they can tell that I'm the type without any talent.

I feel so bad about people going around saying bad stuff about me.

All I wanted was for the person to take down the screenshots of me that are on her Twitter.

All I wanted is to be able to be free to make youtube videos and games and stuff without worrying that the screenshots she posted on her Twitter will be brought up again."
417,Thanks to All Those Who Made my Life Miserable,8,9w2jlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9w2jlc/thanks_to_all_those_who_made_my_life_miserable/,4,1541957301.0,"This is a thank you to everyone at my high school who likes to kill my confidence, lower my trust, sanity and being, and make me feel like life ain't worth live anymore.

Thank you to all those who spread the rumors. You have made all this possible for me. Also, thank you to all those who heard those rumors and either didn't tell me or did nothing. You also helped. You all made me realize that you are all fake  as fuck. Which is funny, seeing as that's what the rumors that you all spread about me are based on. Also,  thank you to those who openly bullied me. That made me feel great. Actually, in all honesty, I prefered those who openly bullied me to the ones who spread the rumors, because at least I knew that those who openly bullied me were never actually my friend instead of being lead on my those that were actually spreading rumors about the whole time. It's harder to tell when people are being fake.

Thank you to all those who told everyone one of my friends to stay away from because I'm a slut, an attention-seeking whore, a bitch, a manipulator and a fucking insane person. I understood why you all did that... It's obvious... Actually, it's not. Can someone please tell me why the fuck people are so mean enough to do all this shit to a defenceless girl who's trying to get through high school without dying?

Another thank you to all those who heard the rumors and did nothing about them, not even tell me. Seriously, really helped me to know who my real friends were. Thanks to all those who say that they believe that I'm actually a good person yet stand by and do nothing while I'm literally taken down to shreds.

Thanks to those who openly told me that I'm making shit up and sitting by myself and being so depressed because I choose to. You obviously have never been through this shit, and have no idea what it's like to have the whole entire grade against you. But that's fine. You don't know and you don't care right? Well, how about you actually listen instead of assuming that everythings okay, because there are plenty of signs to say what the fuck is actually going on, but you just assume that I'm making shit up to make myself upset. Yep, that makes sense.

Finally, thank you to all the teachers, who think the only fucking thing that I need is a fucking appoitment with the fucking consellor. No, I don't need to ""talk"" about my feelings, I need HELP!

&#x200B;

If anyone actually read this, thank you for reading my rant. I'm going through the toughest time at the moment. I posted before (the link is below) and got some amaxing support. I pray that Monday don't kill me and that I can survive the rest of high school. I hope no one else is going through this shit because it isn't fair to anyone. But if anyone is, I'm here to support. You're not alone.

418,Why did my Bullies go this far?,8,9tfl7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9tfl7x/why_did_my_bullies_go_this_far/,13,1541150267.0,"Hello, I'd like to start off with it's been a year and a half since I've graduated high school.  I was bullied by many different people from years 7 to 12 (Elementary school to High School) mostly because I was shy and quiet,I am an easy punching bag for someone to blame on or take their anger out on because most of the time I was too scared to speak up/out and I felt like I had no one by my side.  My 12th year was the worst school year for me.  The bullying started again when I met someone who I thought was my friend.  We shared 3 classes together in 1st semester and we'd always sit by each other.  I started becoming comfortable around them to the point when I was feeling low at one point about personal issues at home and school and mental health issues I've been dealing with for a few years now, I opened up to them about it and that's when they decided to back stab me.  They laughed about it and mocked me infront of the entire class in 3rd period and told everyone in class and their other friends outside of class how I'm feeling.  They sat beside me and I'd get mocked and laughed at saying things like ""Oh I'm feeling so empty inside."" in a 'sarcastic crying' tone.  They would do this thing were they spoke behind my back to other people but in a way so I could hear it when I wasn't looking, if that makes sense.  At times, someone I don't even speak to, who was their friend, went up to me in 3rd period and yelled ""Haha"" right into my ear.  This next part is where I meant in the title, why would they go this far?  At one point, They were sitting next to me in class, because we have assigned seating so we couldn't chose or move about, they said beside me to their other friend across the table, ""he looks like a fucking ugly troll, he should just go fucking kill himself.""  And they laughed.  Never once did they apologise.  Everyday they laughed about it and made me feel bad about myself about that ""kill yourself"" comment and to this day I still do as it sticks with me.  I'm worried with my anxiety and depression I've been dealing with for years now before this, that their words might become mine if I let everything I'm feeling inside build up, not just about this either.  Why would they say this?  What kind of person can say that and laugh about telling someone to die even when they know they might be going through something?  I wish I spoke up to the principal but I didn't because I was scared and they had more 'friends' to back them up and and lie for them.  2nd semester came and I moved schools, I cut contact with all my few friends I had left (3 - 4) because I wanted to start my life over but everything is still sticking with me inside and it's building up to the point I explode out of emotion on others, what can I do now?  Why are people so messed up like this hurting other people for their pleasure and entertainment?"

What was a teasing or bullying moment that still gets to you?  
   
“B.J.” was my nickname from birth until I was 20 or so when I changed my name. Starting in 3rd grade and going until I started a new job in a new community and told everyone to call me Rob, all the kids called me Blow Job. They made up songs and stories about calling me for a blow job.  
  
Then in early Highschool I had one of those painful accidents we’ve all seen in YouTube videos where a kid is trying some stunt and racks himself on a railing. That physical pain ended, of course, but some kid at school saw it happen and he started the rumor that I’d lost a testicle. So all the way through high school, people either called me “Blow Job” or “One Nut.”

So, I'm a grown woman and have been at my job for quite some time now.  I work with a few other woman who are roughly around my age, maybe eight years difference (all between 24-32).  I don't want to get into the previous three years of hell I've been through at this company.  However, due to that, there is some lingering hostility as the woman I work with are friends with the original bully (who no longer works in our dept.)  I am constantly being left out of events, I see them texting each other.  Some might ask how I know they are texting one another.  Well, when I do or say something, one of them picks up there phones, puts it down, then the other persons phone lights up, ect (this goes on for a few minutes at a time).  They do not walk with me when we leave.  They purposly walk in front of me, making it extremely embarrasing as it looks like I am being segregated (I am) from the group.  They give the nasty looks, I over hear them talk about me, I hear them mock me.  I could go on and on.  I've gone to HR about this, twice, nothing seems to work.  The woman are straight ruthless.  I've never met people who are so rude.  I was not raised this way.  I was taught to be kind to everyone.  I don't know why they hate me, but I know they hate me, it is clear.  I try to think of why they might not like me, and I come up with nothing.  I literally mind my own business.  I come in, I sit down, I work, I go to lunch, I come back, I work again and I leave at 5pm.  If anyone has any advice as to why these woman may be treating me like this or how I should handle it, please let me know.  I've literally had enough- I can't take it anymore :/"

422,Getting bullied in college,9,8v01jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/8v01jo/getting_bullied_in_college/,7,1530369329.0,"I've been bullied my whole life. In preschool I remember kids just decided I was weird because I was quiet. No one would play with me, I just sat there on the bench watching everyone else, because if I joined in they would act like it was so alien for me to be joining them. 

That followed me through elementary where I got bullied for being quiet, bullied for having arm hair (literally), bullied for being blonde, kids mocking me with fake sign language and saying, ""Can't you speak?? What's wrong with you? Say the word 'blue'? Are you deaf?"" Again, I chose not to join in in play groups because they would just make a huge deal out of me not saying anything and make another huge deal if I did. 

In middle school the bullying turned to me gaining weight during puberty. I got called ugly a lot. One day we had a ""free period"" for the last day of school and a group of kids who used to be my ""friends"" got together and dared all of the boys in the group to go up to me and ask me out on a date and then say, ""Just kidding, no one would date you because you're ugly. I can't believe you actually thought I was serious."" It was about four or five different boys from my class. My mom had to pick me up early and I was in tears, the teacher made them all line up and apologize to me to which they just rolled their eyes and said, ""Sorry."" And walked back into the classroom. 

A few years later one of the main girls from that group messaged me on Facebook to tell me that she was a born again Christian and wanted to apologize to me and I calmly and politely told her where to shove it. 

High school, I was largely ignored.  Still called ugly by a lot of guys and popular girls. Got pencils thrown at me and literally pushed into lockers. Got made fun of for my fair skin and lack of athleticism. I finally found a friend group my senior year and got close with one of the girls which caused the other girls in the group to make fun of me for my personality, hair, and makeup because they thought I was stealing their best friend even though I liked and was nice to all of them. 

College, I thought would be a fresh start. No one knew me, I could start over. 

Oh, boy, was I wrong. I joined the campus radio station and immediately to know some guys there who asked me to hang out with them. One of them was flirty but I was completely unaware that he was already dating a girl so when I asked him if he wanted to hang out, she went apeshit. Starting calling me names, she was bitchy from Day 1. We all had a group hangout and when the other guys left the room she goes, ""So how did you meet Sam?"" And I said, ""Oh, at the radio station. How did you meet him?"" And she just says, ""Hm."" Later that night I tried to add them all on Facebook and she declined my friend request. That's kind of where it began with people calling me a slut/whore.

Later that year, still friends with that guy, he introduces me to another girl who I immediately like but she's standoffish. Apparently this is another girl that he's been stringing along and she starts to hate me because she thinks I'm stealing her boyfriend. I found this out later that he told her that I'm a psycho and abusive and not to worry about me, that I wasn't a good friend of his. So, another girl calling me a slut/whore/psycho.

(To explain, he called me a psycho because he thought I asked to hang out more than what was considered ""cool"" and because I had gotten mad at him and told him it was really uncool when he didn't tell me about the girls he was seeing while flirting with me)

Within the next month or so, I met another group of guys from the radio station. They scouted me out, I didn't go looking for them, but I didn't mind the idea of having new friends. 

They asked me to play Gamecube with them one night so I went over, and one of the two guys left and I was stuck with one who, long story short, sexually assaulted me. And that ended up happening about 3 more times in the span of the 2 weeks that I knew them. 

One of the two was apologetic to me and wanted to be friends. We hung out once and it was flirtatious but I didn't want it to really go anywhere. I actually told him that I didn't want to but he insisted I look at his boner. 

After that, he began calling me a slut and a whore. 

I met a guy shortly after that that I really clicked with. We dated for a year and I loved the guy to death, the breakup was unexpected and caused me a lot, a lot of pain to the point that I had to drop out of college for a quarter. The entire time we were still talking and he admitted to only dating me because he knew that I loved him and it was nice to feel cared about but that he never actually loved me. That now that he was done with me, he felt more confident and could move on with his life. He said a lot of other nasty things to me, tried to manipulate me into feeling guilty, and actually stole over $500 worth of my belongings. I was completely destroyed, did the whole begging and pleading nonsense. We made up from that but then he just blocked me out of nowhere one day and I hadn't spoken to him since. 

A year on from this, I find out that people are still going around calling me a slut and a liar, psycho, abuser, you name it. It peaked for me when one of them went into my job and tried to get me fired over it by dishing it to a coworker that I was someone who lied about sexual assault and was an abuser to my ex-boyfriend. I decided to say something. 

This was during the #metoo movement, so I came out about the sexual assault, thinking that might inform some of the people who were calling me a whore. 

Oh, no. That backfired hugely. They started harassing me online, calling me liar/abuser/whore saying things like ""If you actually know this person you'll know that etc. etc."" Even though everyone saying that I might have spoken three words to my entire life. 

I found out that my ex-boyfriend that I loved so dearly was actually behind all of the ""abuser"" rhetoric. He went and told his sob story to the bullies (people he always wanted to be friends with but who I warned against) to gain their favor by throwing me under the bus. 

Throughout all of this I asked him to please stand up for me and he said nothing. Not a word except to save his own ass (because I said that he was knowingly and willingly friends with my rapist) that he ""Didn't support any rapists."" 

This month, 4 months after all of that, he sends me an email saying that he's sorry for ""treating me like that"" and that if he sees me around he will say hi. No direct apology. I messaged him back telling him the extent of what his and his friends' bullying has done to me and he said nothing in reply. Absolutely no real apology except that he will wave when he sees me next time. 

For the record, I've been seeing Abuse and Sexual Assault Counselors and have gone to women's centers, I take accountability for my actions and I have told them verbatim some of the conversations and arguments I had with that ex-boyfriend because I was genuinely unsure if I had actually abused him and I was afraid that I had. They told me that I had done nothing out of the ordinary and that his behavior sounded extremely manipulative. 

I've ran the sexual assault by them, it was confirmed as being sexual assault. I've ran the bullying by them and every instance I've been told makes me a psycho or a whore and they've said that I'm not in the wrong. That my actions and responses were perfectly normal and would be expected of anyone in those situations. 

So why was I targeted for it??

There are so many people in my life that have abused me, bullied me, taken advantage of me that you have to start wondering if there is something fundamentally wrong with me for everyone to hate me. 

Almost everyone that I've ever come in contact with except a handful of people. And those people, I've asked them if my behavior is weird and they have said no, and then I've told some of the bullies, like my ex, that other people don't think I'm acting out of the ordinary and I've gotten, ""Your friends seriously support what you're doing?""

This has just taken such a huge toll on me. I don't have any social media, I don't like going out in public or meeting new people. My confidence has plummeted.

I think what bothers me the most is that all of the bullies throughout my life are living so much better and happier than I am. They're all successful and in happy relationships and have a ton of friends...I'll never get my comeuppance. It won't be the ugly duckling turned into a swan story. This is reality, and the truth is that I feel like I'll really never amount to anything and that people will find reasons to hate me and bully me for the rest of my life. "
423,Why kids bully for no reason,9,8ps2e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/8ps2e6/why_kids_bully_for_no_reason/,2,1528570738.0,"They're practicing their social skills.  It's exercise.

Bullying is a social dominance strategy.  You can get great rewards in life through intimidation and criticism.  If you cow somebody hard enough, you can take their property or their opportunities for yourself.  Maybe you can ""borrow"" somebody's toy and never return it.  Or you can discredit a co-worker and get promoted in his place.  Or you can coerce the class nerd into doing your homework.  Yeah, sometimes bullies get punished, but the rewards tend to outweigh the risks so long as their aren't too many predators chasing too few prey.

That's something you can calculate in the abstract.  In practice, humans are motivated to pursue a strategy by instinct.  In the same way that lust motivates us to reproduce, sadism and aggression motivate us to dominate through abuse.

Maybe you're a nice guy.  Being a nice guy also has rewards, sometimes.  People trust you more because you're not a cheat, and reciprocate your kindness out of gratitude.  It's a viable strategy for getting ahead in life.  And like bullying, your behavior is motivated by the emotional rewards more than cold-headed calculation.  You don't calculate ""oh, if I give my buddy a lift to work, he will help me out in X years"".  You do it mainly because you get pleasure in putting smiles on people's faces.  In fact, you like to be nice to people even when you're pretty sure you'll get no reward.  Maybe you like giving to charity or giving to beggars.  The emotional buzz is reward enough.

Bullies are the same.  They are often mean to other people even if it doesn't really serve their interests.  They do it for the pleasure, the emotional buzz that they get from reducing people to cowering wretches, or from duping the gullible.  Being mean to other people for no reason is just as irrational as being nice to other people for no reason.

The reason we're like this is that humans are not good at controlling themselves through cool-headed, dispassionate calculations.  We don't go through life sizing up each encounter and calculating whether being mean or kind is the best strategy.  That's too much work for the brain.  So our brain uses a mental shortcut: stick to standard pattern except in exceptional circumstances.  In other words, instinct.   We are creatures of instinct.  Nice people are wired to be nice most of the time.  Sometimes that backfires but most of the time it rewards.  Bullies are wired to be aggressive and cheat most of the time.  Sometimes that backfires but often it rewards.  Because the rewards outweigh the costs, the instinct to bully tends to persist in the gene pool.

Bullies are acting on an instinct that has been wired into them through evolution.  Bullying is a viable strategy to ensure the person's survival and reproduction, as long as there aren't too many bullies in the population.  Being a bully is like being a predator: it's great so long as you don't have to compete with too many other wolves for the sheep.  Most people aren't bullies, just like in the wilderness prey outnumber predators.

The instinct to bully is mostly genetic.  Some people think bullies are bullies because their parents abuse them.  But actually they are bullies because they inherited bully genes from their parents.

Don't internalize the mean things bullies say about you.  What they say and do to you is mostly driven by irrational impulses shaped by evolution, not you.  And their behavior is thoroughly self-serving.  I am afraid of bullies, but they can no longer make me feel ashamed."
424,My Story,8,8kkb6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/8kkb6c/my_story/,3,1526752454.0,"I always wondered what it was like to be in a popular girl’s shoes. What would it be like to “rule the school” with beauty, charm, and academic intelligence? I guess you can say that this is an unrealistic image. I also always wonder what it’s like to be famous and beautiful. Almost like a Perfect 10. It’s almost impossible to be that perfect, right? Well, that was the case for me. Daydreaming and I guess you can say visualizing that desire. TV, media, advertisements, and teen fashion magazines \(you name it\) create this façade of fame and popularity. I was lured in just from all of that.

But in reality, I was just an ordinary Korean American girl that never really had a sincere support of friends growing up. Even to this day as a woman, I lost girlfriends because their insecurities and their role as the mean girl overruled the friendship. Bullying, harassment, racism, and discrimination occurred all from kindergarten to even sadly, art school. Yes, art school. You would assume that there wouldn’t be any of that because it’s an art school. Unfortunately, it’s everywhere including professional working environments. I experienced that as well. It’s not just in school grounds. 

I guess the reason why I am writing and venting this all out is because of 13 Reasons Why. Cliché… I know. I binge-watched the entire Season 2 and literally finished an hour and half ago. This really reopen a very heavy part of me where I was feeling so much empathy of almost every character particularly Hannah’s story. Tear by tear was dropping down my cheek. I couldn’t stop these feelings and the pain again. I kept having these random flashbacks of not just one advisor in college not supporting my case.  All I saw were constant eyes rolling with impatience and not having any empathy at all of how hysterical and traumatized I was. It hurt all over. It hurt really fucking badly, almost to the point where it was stabbing me internally. That’s when I started to cut my wrist a couple of times back at my apartment and it was pretty deep. I failed that semester and I felt the world was against me… all of the professors, classmates, and the advisors at my school. The online bullying on Facebook in the comment section and being left out in classes were a majority of the reasons why. I felt like a failure and I did contemplate on suicide. Thank God I didn’t go through with it. Something in me said not to go there and not to give up on my dreams as a fashion designer. I couldn’t give it all up. I just couldn’t. 

My intuition was telling me that I could possibly start all over again and persevere, which I did. I still am on that path and trying to persevere. But I still feel somewhere with the Universe that there is injustice. Sometimes I wonder why, me? These girls and that gay guy never thought of their actions. Not one bit. The advisors and professors supported them all and enabled the behaviors. They got away with the crime. There has also been some success in their careers. This is me as a flawed human talking and venting. These emotions and the pain of feeling those times are still in there somewhere. You may forgive, but you can never forget. Somehow, I’m allowed to feel the injustice and verbalize that thought into writing. My voice was invisible to the university. A few years later, they have brought it out to light about bullying because of these intense competitions and projects. But my own voice and story was never significant to their anti-bullying subjects, right? I was never significant to them because I assume that I didn’t grow up in a wealthy, prestigious family just like the 80-90% of the students that went to this dream school of mine. Sometimes I look back and tell myself, I should have been much more assertive and stronger. I should have stood up to all of them. I was too nice and quiet. 

Regarding other past situations, I grew up in a very small suburban town, where there were not many people of color at all including the Asian community. I was one of the very few Asians and the only Korean from Kindergarten to 7th Grade. There was so much hatred over my appearance and especially with my ethnicity. Almost everyday on that bus, I was bullied because of that. As much as I tried to fit in, as I got older, these “friends” would come and go. Some of them were too embarrassed to be seen around with me because of their “reputation.” Most of the high school girls that I grew up with were mean girls including the boys. Prom was the climax of it all from being humiliated and bullied for my ethnicity at a comedy club in NYC by a mean girl and some mean boys. There is so much to be said about my past experiences as the victim. There is also a lot for me to say as what it was like to be a bully for a short amount of time. It felt miserable.

Deep down inside, I hated the peer pressure around me. I hated being convinced that my “reputation” would be easily ruined if I hung out with that particular girl or dated that boy. It’s easy and contradicting for me to say here that I’m not perfect. I’m not a saint either. I’m only human who makes mistakes as well and eventually learns from them just like everyone else in this world. I wish I could sincerely apologize to some of the girls and boys that I hurt. I was a new girl being stupid of trying to fit in because I was new and I just wanted to feel accepted. I wanted to make some sincere friends because I barely had any in my old town. I wanted to know what it felt like. But looking back, the girls that I thought were my  “friends” were mean girls.  I eventually realized that this wasn’t who I am. So I stopped following their bullying tactics and decided to just be me. When I was asked out a few times by that boy, I wanted to know what that was like too. It felt special, yet the other girls didn’t think so. They labeled him as a “player,” but he just wanted to seek a relationship with a pretty girl that he genuinely liked. Eventually, rumors and bullying started circling around and transpiring again. I realized from reflecting back, everything that I wanted and imagined at that time was irrelevant to the real world. There aren’t high school cliques or jocks and cheerleaders that are always going to be after you. There is so much more out there. There is so much more to life. I started opening up to that idea when I entered high school. I couldn’t wait to get out of there and move to NYC for fashion. I kept visualizing that almost everyday and by looking at art school catalogs. I guess I have to say that part of that dream did come into fruition. 

Well, that being said, I felt like I was in Hannah’s shoes. I also felt what it was like to be in a mean girl’s shoes. Anyway, I don’t know why I’m even writing this at 5:00 AM. To be honest, I’m just pouring it all out. I just needed to after reflecting back tonight. Although, somewhere deep inside of me, it still hurts even though I have let a lot go. I despise the fact that people would tell me “I’m too sensitive.” I recently learned that many people these days don’t want to take responsibility for their own actions. Many don’t want to feel the guilt and be at fault for what they did to the other person. They just ignorantly brush it off so they don’t have to apologize or just simply admit that he or she has hurt you. It almost feels like some form of manipulation or even gaslighting. Today, as a woman, I still experience mean girls around me from time to time, which becomes losses of friendships. Maybe it’s also a blessing in disguise because they were never sincere from the very beginning. There were ulterior motives. 

Even from a few past relationships,  the boyfriends were bullies who made up lies and rumors to their friends, who also went to our high school. This also includes in my past working environments. Sometimes it hurts and saddens me. Other times, I try to let it all go and move on from the pain and betrayals. This is life, isn’t it? Or would it get any better if there was much more kindness, love, and understanding?

Edit: I guess the reason why I posted this is because my advice to anyone out there is don’t be like these people. And don’t do what I did either. Try to be kind, compassionate, understanding, and sensitive to those who are being bullied and harassed. Try to set an example out there. This world is cruel, selfish, and vicious already, but live your life to the fullest. Don’t let anyone bring you down. Fulfill your dreams. Manifest them. Don’t ever give up just because that person or others told you to. Remember, you have the power. Thanks for letting me share my story. I hope it doesn’t offend anyone on here."

I began faking illnesses to stay home from school, would call home to have my Mom come get me stating that I wasn't feeling well. After some time, on the way home, my Mom pulls the car over and asks what is going on. I tell her everything. She advises me to stick up for myself. 
The next day I go to school and sure enough my bully begins her daily assholeness. Today is different, I don't walk away, I don't allow her to continue. I tell her I'm not gonna take her crap anymore. Next thing I know we are physically fighting. I somehow make a move my older brother always did to me, I pulled her arm behind her back to keep her from hitting me. I felt powerful.  I gave it a little bit too much of a lift and accidentally broke her arm. 

I have always felt really bad about it...30 years later. 

My Parents were called to the school, my mom arrived and we met with the Principal. I was being suspended. My Mom was having nothing of it. She made him aware of ALL of the staff I went to while being bullied and no one did anything for a year and a half. If you suspend my Daughter, I am going to the School Board office !!

I did not get suspended. The bully  never bothered me again, neither did anyone else for that matter. 

I don't condone my actions of violence, but the rest of my school days were much better. "

430,I was that kid. This all really happened.,9,37a0q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/37a0q6/i_was_that_kid_this_all_really_happened/,0,1432635120.0,"There was this one kid who had to have a teacher follow him around all day. He switched into my elementary school during the summer between my second and third grade year. I had heard classmates say that it was because he would unpredictably become too violent and needed a teacher to keep him from hurting others. Or that he would trick other students into doing bad things, or do the dirty deeds himself, such as stealing sports equipment from others at recess. One time I walked in on him him using a urinal with his pants down to his ankles in the public bathroom. Either he didn’t know how to use the bathroom properly or did not care enough to do so, both options resulting in him being a person to be avoided. He went to a separate class with more teachers and less students.

What was he doing in our school?

As middle school came around, I was upset to see that he had also been assigned a part in the play. There’s no way I’d want to be seen near that kid. Not only was he mentally retarded, but he was overweight at this point as well. He still had a teacher follow him around, but I still hadn’t found out the reason why. Luckily, she typically had her nose buried in her smartphone, and without supervision, we were often in a position of control. He would do whatever you told him to do; his actions were as limitless as we were clever. We would convince him to do whatever public humiliation we could imagine, from slapping random girls on the ass to flicking off our director. And the best part was, he’d do it with a smile on his face, seemingly unrepentant for his actions.

What did he think he was doing?

In high school, he would come to my lunch table and do ridiculous stunts to get attention in the form of laughter. We egged him on whenever he told us something that would seem embarrassing to any normal person, but to him, he seemed to enjoy exposing his dirty laundry, as laughs of criticism are better than no laughs at all. He even developed a crush on a girl at our table, going so far as to buy her some expensive jewelry to try and see if she had reciprocated feelings. She was so embarrassed that she skipped school when she heard it would happen. But the kid was insistent that if he could not give it to her, someone else should. He asked for our help. Blank stares traveled from one side of the table to the other, as he searched for an accomplice for his latest crime. Pair by pair, our hands remained resting on the table, as nobody raised their hand to volunteer.

Why would he ask us to do that?

A few years later, I attended an award ceremony as more of a formality than anything else. I hadn’t noticed his attendance until his name was called on the intercom. As I watched him walk up, I thought about how never in a hundred years would I think he and I would share a stage receiving awards of a similar caliber. I began to reflect on our all of our past experiences together, as I had essentially watched him grow from a child in grade school to a young adult, but when I saw him, I could still see him as the kid who dropped his jeans to the ground in third grade.
After the awards ceremony, there were refreshments of generic sodas and punch. While talking to a few of my friends, he approached me and congratulated me on my Honor’s Award of Physics. He still had a smile plastered across his face – the same smile he had when he performed for us at the play or at our lunch table. He shook my hand proudly. He kept no record of my wrongs. He was never selfish or angry, just misrepresented. He tried to show love when he could, in whatever way he thought would work, whether it was giving jewelry to a girl out of his league, or blindly following our orders. He genuinely congratulated me and let go of my hand. I then continued my aimless banter with my peers and parents.

Was I the one with the real mental issue?


So this is the factual accounts of a few mentally ill people I've encountered from my time in elementary school to my senior year of high school. The main kid that this refers turns out to have Asperger's and a condition where he can never tell when he's full, so if left alone with an unlimited amount of food, he will literally eat himself to death, thus requiring a teacher to follow him around. It took me so much longer to realize how unforgivable my actions were, and the worst part is I can't apologize because he never knew I had ever wronged him. Not once did I ever look at his situation with true compassion. Looking back, I can tell I did it all because I wasn't happy with myself. I was displacing all of my shortcomings on another helpless human being. I'm so sorry Matt."

432,Teacher Bjørndal's method,10,1b77k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1b77k8/teacher_bjørndals_method/,1,1364532902.0,"This text was, for a while, the most viewed article in one of the major newspapers in Norway in early 2011. I couldn't find an english translation anywhere, so I gave it a shot myself. Any spelling- or grammatical errors are mine, and I've taken a few small liberties to make the language flow better in English. I've also aquired a newfound respect for professional translators. 

Anyway; Teacher Bjørndal's method:

--------------------

There's a knock on the door to the class room currently occupied by class 9B. They are about halfway into a Norwegian lesson. Outside stands the class teacher. When the class sees him, they sit up straight. He has that effect on them, and they immidiately realize that there must be a serious reason for him to seek them out in the middle of the lesson of another teacher.

-I want to talk to Arne, Peter, Lisa, Ingrid, Gunnar and Tone. You will join me in a group room now.

The named students look at each other questioningly, gets up and walks out of the room.

-Sit down, the class teacher says briskly as he closes the door behind them in the group room. And listen carefully:

-Else was not at school yesterday. She's not here today either. She is at home. She has such a stomach ache that she can't manage to get to school. I just talked to her mother, who told me that she's had it like that all autumn.

The pupils looks uncertainly at the teacher, then each other. They recognize his story.

-Else isn't at school because she hates being here. That's partially your responsibility.

-We? But none of us have ever... Lise starts.

-No, none of you have ever bullied Else. It's not you who make fun of her when she has to read aloud in class, who pushes her, or comments on how she looks. Rune and Egil does. No, your responsibility is that you don't do anything to stop it. You guys have in common that you are among the class' most respected; best in sports, best in school, good at football, or just popular in general. No one has more power than you in this class. But you use the power for your own sake, not to prevent Else from being bullied by those who needs someone weaker than themselves to pick on. Not to make sure she gets to participate or belong. It's pathetic, and I'm extremely disappointed in you, says the teacher.

The pupils stared at him, then down at the table. Blushing. They alreay know the feeling. Thought that they should say something, but hasn't done so. Can't say anything now. The teacher continues:

 -I expect you, *especially* you, to take responsibility, he says, and slams a hand on the table. I expect you to solve this, that you do what you can to stop this. And that you do it without telling anyone about this conversation. This remains between us, and god help you if I ever hear anything about this outside this room.

A few days later the class has another lesson in Norwegian. A weak teacher has enough once again allowed himself to be persuaded by Egil that Else should read aloud from the book. She has red cheeks, stutters , and can't get started. Rune laughs loudly, shaking his head. Then Arne - by far the class best in sports - gets up. Points at Rune and says: ""And you! You'll shut up, you idiot!""

Rune shuts up. He got told in a language he understands, by an authority he understands.

The small group of pupils from group room never talks about the special meeting they had with the teacher. They just try to influence things where they can. The pressure on Else gets imperceptibly weaker and weaker, but the students from group room feel little pride. They're going to be ashamed the rest of their lives for not intervening earlier.

I know, because I was in that group room at the time, in the mid 1980s. I sat there and heard the legendary teacher Øyvind Bjorndal, a man the whole class respected deeply, shaking me and several of my friends after a fall where we had neglected us.

I thought about the episode many times in the years since. On Bjorndals method, so efficient, so very simple. It is impossible to forget such an eye-opener, and it does something to how you view responsibility for the rest of your life.

Else can thank Øyvind Bjorndal that her life gradually became a little easier. But those of us in the group room that day may have even more reason to thank him.

Now, I don't think she's right. I've been a good friend to her, especially when she's needed it (i.e her breakups). So I have no clue what to do.

While bullying is definitely a problem, students are constantly told to tell adults about their problems. While in some scenarios this has proven to be a good method, in most others it has proven to be a waste of time. So if telling higher authority doesn't work, why is it so bad to go and fix the job yourself? I myself see no reason for going up to a bully and doing the same thing he did to me. So Reddit, what do you think?"

Looking back now, I really got bullied by a teacher so it’s weird? I went to a preppy elementary school. I’ll give a couple examples.

She didn’t like me. I was a very shy untroubled kid during my childhood. I was always the butt of the joke. She use to poke fun of me during class and call me names which led to other kids calling me names and also picking on me because that teacher made it okay to do so. There was a time when I didn’t want to go on a week long school trip. She decides to bring it up during class saying “So I’ve heard that you’re not going to science camp. I’m not surprised because you’re so lost in your head that we’ll find you at the bottom of a cliff screaming your name. we don’t want that. Or you would be so lost that you don’t even know you’re down the cliff.”

I had a tutor to help me with school and I was helped with on an essay that used a lot of vocabulary for a 5th grader. One of her friend teachers that was teaching the class with her got mad because she thought I plagiarized. She brought me up to the front of the class and got close then literally screamed at my face about plagiarizing also that I could end up in jail even for a 5th grader. I tried telling her I didn’t plagiarize, I had a tutor. Before I could finish she still begins shouting and screaming and telling the class that I’m an example of a bad kid that if anyone who follows my example will be brought up to the front of the class to be humiliated because she ‘doesn’t play by the rules.’ I remember wanting to cry so bad at the moment. I wasn’t even the emotional type.

Because of the second story, my 5th grade teacher (not her friend) started calling me a liar whenever I turn in work or say things loud so the class hears “did you plagiarize this time? I’m going to double check yours especially because guess why? ...I don’t like liars.” “We wouldn’t be surprised if you ended up at the bottom of a cliff because you’re a liar, you’re lost, and quiet. You sit by yourself at lunch you don’t care to talk to other kids.”

I didn’t get why and still don’t get why they hated me so much because I was a incredibly shy and quiet. I had like a good group of friends but never had class with any of them. The fact that they were women is utterly disappointing."

So growing up I experienced a high degree of social exclusion and bullying, up until I was 15 I had no real friends and I was ostracised and socially decimated by almost everyone around me. From then I made friends however all of my sense of community was build around a weed addiction, I got along with addicts who I would go out with all the time and up until lockdown that's how I would live, in my own bubble of self comfort. I realise now I need to get out there more, however wherever I go I am always scared that I am not liked or just don't fit in, it's so hard to go out and approach a girl, find new friends, or even just like myself for who I am. I work so hard on myself, in the gym and academically, I try get knowledge wherever I can find it but I'm always followed by these thoughts fuelled by my devastatingly low self esteem, I know I'm different and I guess I'd rather be different than the same as everyone else but it's a double edged sword, I can't ever fit in properly, I can't effectively articulate myself, I can't help let other people walk all over me and it just causes such a heavy weight on me that I can't feel I can bare anymore. I hate it, I experience suicidal thoughts fairly often and idk why I don't just accept who I am like I'm not even that bad from an unbiased perspective, I'm smart, conventionally attractive and a genuinely nice person yet I still feel like I'm never going to be good enough, I'm not good enough, I've never been good enough. Why can't I just be happy with who I am and why do I have to doubt myself, everybody has such an easy time with doing it, what am I missing?

The story that started it all was at a Christmas service at my church. My family isn't religious, but we liked going to the Christmas Eve Service. I think I was 10 or 11, and the organ player's son approached me (he was probably 12 or 13, the same age as my step brother [SB from here on out] ). 

He came up to me and said ""you know that SB calls you Sasquach right? Because you're so hairy"". I hadn't started shaving my legs yet.

Now we’re the same age, but i’m a very small girl and he is much bigger than i am. At first i thought we were play fighting but afterwards i felt humiliated and scared, like i was going to cry, and despite my confusion of how to feel i know that friends aren’t supposed to leave you feeling like that which is making me question if he really was my friend from the start, and if i was dumb enough to have been bullied all this time lol. He left work right after this happened btw. 

It’s also worth mentioning i kind of have a crush on him which makes it worse for me because i really don’t want to like him but i can’t seem to help it [which sounds pathetic, i KNOW]. 

I’d have pegged him as a bully, it’s just he’s done a lot of things for me that convinced me he was actually a friend and that we WERE just playing around all those times, but this recent encounter has left me feeling perplexed. 

Would appreciate some objective views lol...how do i reorganise my boundaries around him??? i want to maintain a working relationship with him at the very least..."

450,Bullying and self esteem,7,f4toug,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/f4toug/bullying_and_self_esteem/,2,1581902365.0,The one thing that stands out the most that a bully has ever done was simply wash her hands. This happened in middle school and I’m now in my twenties. I had OCD as a kid. Washed my hands so much that they turned red or even bleed. I always got made fun of because of this. One day this girl offered to shake my hand(after doing a group project). She then proceeded to look disgusted after shaking my hand and then said she had to wash her hands afterwards. Mind you I have OCD with germs and hand washing so my hands were pretty clean. I never felt so disgusted by myself. My OCD has had decreased greatly and my hands are soft opposed to being dry like before. Still till this day I’m afraid to shake peoples hands or have contact with another person because of this and social anxiety. Bullying has affected my self esteem that even as a adult I can’t seemed to get passed it. It made me not trust my peers. I constantly think everyone is laughing at me or making fun of me behind my back. Even as a adult I still face some bullying. It sucks that even adults can continue to be bully’s. I had some teachers that were not so friendly. Bullying sucks and should be talked about more in the media...

Now the bully’s parents are texting us constantly saying my kid is lying. We have multiple text messages showing the bullying, but they say the texts are fake and act like their child is the victim.

They would throw shit at my head in class throw food at me belittle me in front of my friends. In woodshop they would constantly pants me if  I wore anything that didn’t have a belt and sometimes pantsed me butt naked. They would constantly talk shit and I got into skating and now I have to deal with them at the skatepark where they gang up and harass me because there’s 4 of them and one of me. I genuinely want to beat up their ringleader naveen who has done the most bullying to me but at least they’re burnouts who smoke weed, vape, and are failing school.
Also they can beat me in a fight because I’m skinny and one of them has won many fights so I can’t do anything but I started weightlifting again to help.

UPDATE 2/10:
I started working out doing body weight and dumbbell exercises, and for anyone reading this who is also being bullied; work out. It boosts your confidence and makes you feel good about yourself. I cut my bullies out of my life and am way happier then I was months ago at my old high school getting harassed."

I'm 24 now, and sometimes I go through these memories in my head and I feel so pissed at times. I wish I could go back and time to help my poor self, to ""invisibly"" help myself or something.

However, recently there’s been a complete 180 in their attitude. Their father was abusive towards them and their mother and has now been kicked out of the house. It’s a lot for them and their family to deal with. They never talked to me personally about it but I was sympathetic and was always available to them to talk.

Recently, they’ve started making harsh and snide remarks towards me. They make comments about how much money I have, how “privileged” I am and I think they’ve tried to exclude me from certain outings. Likewise, recently I said in the group chat about how I’m behind on study in funny terms and they decided to start telling me off in the group chat and accused me of “laughing it off.” But most of the time, they’re nice to me and friendly towards me, but then there will be this sudden swing and they’re very hostile toward me. I’m trying to think if I said or did anything to upset them and I can’t think of anything major (maybe I have a habit that they find annoying but that’s all I can think of.)

I’m not sure how to deal with it or if other friends have noticed. I’ve been so desperate for a friend group for so long I don’t want to endanger this friend group by causing trouble with someone, especially a person who is going through so much.

This is my first post on this subreddit.I wanted to speak on this situation for a long time other than a therapist. I’m hoping maybe can heal.from.it  or get some feedback on it, since I  kept everything to my self for so long. I want to not be completely one sided as it would not.be right to.put the blame on them..

I graduated high school in 2013, and I had been awarded a scholarship to an art school for 45,000  ( 11,000 per year or semester I.think). This is considered a big  deal to my family at the time since I'm a first generation and we weren’t an affluent family so college for me would be expensive. I'm thinking before I officially start as a freshman that I should work on my mental health so that I did not behave the same way I did in high school as I  was currently seeing a new therapist.. My mom totally disregarded this and said "" You just need to work on your art"". One side told.me.to disobey her the  other part of me says to obey and listen... 

I got to pre collage at the same art college I attended. At first it was okay but very lonely... then I started feeling like I didn't belong/ talked about/ despite this not being the case. 

During final a portrait I made had been run over by a truck and because of my perfectionism it made me like huge feelings of feeling like a failure, etc.

During critique, I walked out when I stated this, I felt a part felt like they were laughing at me. One My head is swirling, big wave of emotion. I felt like walking out of the situation ( like a girl in my class did before ) and  to avoid  a huge emotional episode...

The instructor chases down the hallway asking me if I’m okay, I asked to be left alone... I threw all my art away, mom picked me up.. I didn't want to be seen or acknowledged.

&#x200B;

After I had calmed down, I felt embarrassed and I didnt want there to be no discomfort in college ( because some of the people in my pre college course would also be attending the school) I thought to.email them.and explain the situation ( plus doing so in person at the time made me squeamish and afraid of conflict).Didn't have any social media info, I messaged one online , but another a teacher assistant I got angry at. Knowing sending this email would be a bad idea and it felt better putting out whatever negative angry thoughts and throwing it away... However when I went to.discard the message on my old touch/keyboard board phone.. I accidently pressed 'Sent'. Immediately  think' shit what the fuck did I just do!?’ 

First week in college and I am nervous... new people take awhile.to get comfortable and even then I keep to myself...

So one day in class, ( can't remember what week it was) they were talking about "" someone being from here.. at first I'm thinking are they referring to me? But learning from.my.therapist that I can get paranoid I disregarded the feeling.

Here where things really took off…

So the person that I have message them, told others that I messaged.them... the teacher assistant told one of students.... I'm.hearing other people on campus talk about it...

Hearing  words like stalker come up..at this point I know they are referring to me..and  wanted to explain myself but I was scared/ nervous..So I tried to left it alone. 

Since I have a learning disability and I have trouble being able to translate my thoughts verbally meaning things will sound like jibber jabber. It’s difficult when I want to opinion on something and a part of you can’t an withewls you from doing so. In addition, people will assume you have no idea what you are talking about and therefore will try to simplify/ repeat what you are saying and assume I am stupid. I tried to explain before ( to even one of them who had ADHD), and they sa

Also this has caused me to be shy among other people. Like I would want to talk to people, and I end staring, because internally two personalities are fighting with each whether or not I should say “ Hi”. 

It started happening multiple times, when I would try to speak  my mind in class and people will make snarky comments that I need to shut up ( especially with this particular girl who had a bull ring on her nose that I **HATED**), or assume I’m uneducated or said something offensive. In addition in this same class we had an exercise where we needed to respond to a ( poem?) by typing them on other people’s laptops. Now I use Windows, and Macs for some reason feel weird to type on. I don’t know if it’s the keys placement or how small they are. So typing on them felt weird and unnatural to me. I go back to see the responses and everyone made their fonts  super big, meaning they probably assumed I was stupid( which happened in all of my classes). 

I felt guilty in saying that I did  try to appease any of these people into thinking otherwise without explaining myself. Like at the time, I did not know how to control my big feelings, even though I have a half that is more rational thinking. All it really did was support their argument. Ending in one one liking me at campus. Shit, I even ended up seeing who the hell these people were on facebook. Like this stuff was really affecting me, but like I didn't know what I could do really. 

In addition, people on campus  were thinking I was following people around campus after I had made a trip to try to go to the doctor  I’ve been going to since I was a baby by transit ( this was my first time doing so by myself since I did not know which routes to take, I was very sheltered).  I saw one of my classmates on the block I needed to get to. I’m thinking to myself… shit they are going to think I’m following them now…

Next day, in  class, people were making comments ( you know like those comments that seem they are not talking about you but they are..) and  this was pissing me off. Then  the nose ring had to audacity to make an off racist comment..and I tried to call them out. This lead to me asking them why is it that everyone was so insistent on talking about me, and doing shotty shit like wondering who I was without asking me.. Meanwhile across the room, a  student drew a caricature of me, and saying that it was not me even though the drawing shared similar physical characteristics ( curly hair, hoop earrings), meanwhile the instructor was distracted by another student. In addition, they added in a speech bubble to the drawing with a quote of something I told a security guard from the other night when I wanted to take a cab home because I did not want to have another anxiety attack on the transit. 

So all them left the classroom annoyed. While I looked at the drawing, I thought of taking a picture.. I erased it instead.  And my instructor told me while looking at the drawing, how kids can be so mean.. Despite one of them being 25…

I told some friends of mine what had happened.. And they asked me if I took a picture. I tried to show them a negative of the white board. And one of them said, that if what I said was true (meaning they didn’t believe me, I mean who would)... I could sue them. But I didn’t want to resort to that.  

Stuff like this basically happening everyday for the rest of the year…..

1. People thinking I’m stealing laptops and looking on their phones. A girl snatched my phone out of my hands thinking it was hers ( we had the same model). It ended up being on the other side of the table. 
2. During a group presentation, since I was not ready ( going through this, and stuff a home). My groupmate proceeded to make fun of how I was standing to the other class. Instead of saying, I could not focus on a project because I am not able to mentally handle this, and shit at home. I tried to explain to them I had ADHD, they also had it but they were saying that "" You knew you had a presentation"". But even then does it excuse how you treated me? 
3. People constantly thinking I had this “They are haterz” mentality… yet I found everything to be annoying and did not want any of this attention. Dissociated at class a couple of times, wishing I was out of my body. 
4. Me feeling I could not make friends and enjoy college since everyone believed based on what others told them. I wanted to tell them. 
5. Feeling paranoid, to the point I felt nervous going to campus. Having to make alternate routes to make sure that others did not think I was following them.. Ex. Had this ha group setting where I saw someone look at me assuming I was stalking this said group of people. Made me feel like I could not hang out  with anyone outside of school because of this. 
6. Hearing from people who go to the school, even outside of campus talking about it and mentioning how it ‘ technically’ isn't bullying. Making me feel like I had deserved this treatment and brought it onto myself. 
7. The group warning someone who I was talking to before ( we were having a nice conversation actually..), after getting done from a therapy appointment. Then I heard “ thanks for the warning ..”, and this person never talked to me again….
8. People constantly making comments on what I was wearing ( saying how I looked like a bum), my shoes, my music ( like they were listening in on my music and I heard them., my eyes especially since they go wayward, people suggested making memes. 
9. People , and entire classes sitting away from me, and not critiquing my artwork ( meaning they sat there for a whole 5 mins not saying anything or not talking about off conversations.), and the instructors reaffirming anyone to comment on my work.  This happened a lot. 
10. Talking about me… in front of me  thinking I did not notice ( this also continued into the next year.) Everyone was so hush hush about everything, talking about certain things that happening in classes I was in.  
11. People listening in when I talked to a school counselor and talking about it with others. 
12. Since I felt mentally stressed out, I felt defeated and was having trouble adjusting  to the workload. I had a group project I was made to present to. One of the people in my team made fun of my stance as I talked.
13. During a field trip to Chicago, all day people talked about me. I even heard the security guards at  the Museum mention how all the students were talking about a single person. I couldn’t even enjoy it…..
14. At Senior Thesis, I felt alone. And the student teacher admitted to someone that they felt responsible. Since the entirety of my class had talked about me all year.

Then, there was this one incident has permanently affected me. Basically I was researching on a paper, one for my  sources lead to a very sketchy website. It was based on a forum I was half reading since it was so late…I clicked on the link it was a site where I assuming people had recorded girls who gone of those webcam chat sites. And it made me panic. Because I did that at 16… The next day, people were huddled in class wondering why I was on the site. This was more confirmed that this was something they were talking about when  girl in my class told them how she is on it. Then I assumed they might’ve found a footage of mine, because they started watching it… laughing at it… the instructor even came around and told them to turn it off. 

The main guy suggested that it be funny if they made copies and sent it to around campus. A girl told them how they shouldn’t for legal reasons while looking at me. ( Because of this.. I keep all my privacy settings on everything private). 

I saw them do all this..and I froze… tried to remove myself from the situation.. I didn’t know how to handle it.. Or what to say to someone… 

You may be thinking why did I tell anyone?..

I did.. I told my counselor during the first  and she said “ Sounds like you are stuck in High School”, and “ I’m not a therapist”..

I told about the caricature to my parents. Constantly telling them ( I panic when I do this. I didn’t know what to do in this situation. I left out the stuff of the website. Besides,  how would they react to find out about the webcam stuff. ). My mom called the Dean. I sat down with him, and I do not know how to exactly explain this ( because who would really believe me? I thought.  that a whole group of students was doing this to one person? He was going to think I was crazy.). So I pretend that I maybe overreacted. I tried to tell them who.He asked me last names.. And I didn’t know last names..I wanted to focus in school.

I think a few teachers had heard about this, as they heard students talking about it...I’m thinking how the hell do they even know? I was at home! Even the next year, my ex boyfriend's friend , was checking my computer ( like he knew coding so he was really intelligent with it). Saw that they were some virus or maybe a spyware, and who even made it was doing a good job at hiding it. Even then, I could not prove that it was them as I had some pirated art programs downloaded. 

I’m struggling to not show that all this talk of me being a stalker, making me scared of myself, feeling like I was alone and crazy ( with the addition of problems at home) was affecting me. And I ended up with an anxiety attack... And this person told me that “ You know this is how we are going to view you as for now on right?”. And I just sat quiet, because I felt there was no point in trying to explain, because everyone is going to think I am lying or making excuses. 

( Side note currently I've been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder which explained these actions, but it still doesn't excuse. ).

By the end of the semester, few of them friended me on facebook. I only accepted so that the whole thing would be over ( even though i wanted to block them).  The next semester it was still affecting me.. I self harmed. Friends at did make at campus, whenever I wanted to talk to them about it, I’d try to talk about something else… or I felt since a few of them were friends with the group/ individuals that did these things.. I got the impression either were withholding some things  from  or they didn’t know. 

Even one class that they were talking about me, watching me read... and one of them said "" Look she knows how to read"", and I asked my professor if I could leave class early. 

The next year I was thinking, it would be better…  

 I walked down the hall form an Adobe Class, I heard a bunch of girls mentioned how “ We should tell..”, but nothing came from it. I’m thinking why are they still talking about me..? Girls from another english course would talk about how “ it’s a good think that’s she’s straight”,  apparently they learned that I was dating a guy at the time.. (biphobia much? ). 

Then we had  a messy breakup at a party, that’s when the girl with the bull ruing kept saying how I show shave my head, one girl noted how I looked “sane”. Even those same girls who said about telling what had happened, I assumed ( I questioned this maybe thinking I was hearing things ) they invited my ex-boyfriend to the campus. And how I know is, when they were laughing.. He had a distinct laugh.. People were suggesting how I needed to grow up... despite the actions of others. 

So then, I decided that I didn't  want to go through this again for another year, and that I was done with everything ( working a factory job working a double shift, constantly giving my mom money, my parents in fighting ).

 I took a lot of my pills, swallowed them the previous night. I woke up… thinking it didn’t work. I had walked to my room, and the next thing that happened was I thought I slept on my bed.. I really just collapsed on the floor and ( according to my mom) I was seizuring. Ended up in ER for a week and inpatient next week…

Tried to finish the rest of the year, and by that time I did not want to spend another year there. I dropped out, my school counselor I even told that I had attempted to take my life, they asked if there was anything they could do. It was like why bother? Just play the role that I am disillusioned instead of telling the truth. 

I've even  talked about it with my therapist, and even doubted myself all this time. Thinking maybe I have schizophrenia and I’m imagining all this and hearing voices ( despite most of the time visually seeing this happen). Maybe I deserve to be treated so, for how I was acting sometimes. All could say that she was sorry that it happened. 

I was even brought up again, during a Trump protest two year later..

Even a few months ago,  before I moved and was talking to my therapist regarding getting my Bachelors. I was worried about this happening again. .. She told me “ I thought you were over this already”, but she understands I needed a new start.  I’ve told a psychiatrist before and he basically didn’t believe me and thought I was super paranoid…

It’s *still* affecting  how I trust people, my relationships with others, where I can walk freely, and I'm worried that this is happening again at my new college. I tried to forgive, rationalize it, and move on but I still go back to this. I can’t go on another year going back to that mind frame.  I understand not wanting to associating with anyone based on how they act, and I accept that I did something things  that did not put me in the best light. But I wonder if they will every admit what they did and take  responsibility for their actions. 

I even considered trying to talk to them to ask “ Why”, ask if all this really happen.   Like why have so much focus on me for two years?  I kept thinking back and forth wondering was I really bullied.  

But it’s been 4 years since then, and everyone of them has graduated.  I’m trying to better my life, but this thing keeps holding me back. I  regret every single day that I didn’t take the picture of that caricature, or told the Dean, or did anything to stop it. I still feel angry..

What do I do, reddit? Am I  really crazy?  Did I deserve any of this?"
459,It never goes away,9,do6kcf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/do6kcf/it_never_goes_away/,2,1572284439.0,"I tried to be concise but there's too much of it and it's been destroying me for years. If you read all this I thank you so much. I just need this. Nothing else seems to help. 

Basically, I'd been bullied most of my life for being silly and not being conventionally attractive, but in high school I made it look like it didn't bother me and life really started to turn around as people stopped bullying me and I started associating with people who actually liked me instead of trying to impress everyone. I always turned the other cheek and let people walk on me, but standing firm changed things. But still, I tried to commit suicide at the end of high school. Even though things had finally become okay, I had been unreasonably sad since the bullying began in preschool and it seemed like a witch hunt against me. The school was more concerned I would hurt others and not myself even though I treated everyone with kindness and still got harassed and even punched on several occasions. I had been depressed ever since school started. I couldn't go through with faking it anymore. 

Obviously, something stopped me and I didn't end it. I went to the psych ward. For the first time in my life, I got antidepressants. And I got medicine also to clear up my acne. I couldn't shave there since no razors, so I grew my facial hair out for the first time. And I came back... handsome. Not only that but happy. People could see that I was happy and were more happy to be around me than when I was just faking it, even though I was pretty good at it. I thought I could handle college and whatever life threw at me! 

It all started out great. Marching band and new student orientation... I made so many friends and as a goofball and kind person people were drawn to me. I didn't try to be the center of attention but I genuinely loved to make people laugh and feel good and several of my friends say I even saved them when no one else even noticed them, and they thought I would be too cool to talk to them! But my section leader in band, another student a grade up chosen by the director to manage the players of that instrument's practice sessions, became jealous.

She wanted to be the center of attention. She yawned really loudly with her mouth open always and said awful jokes that no one laughed at. It's not that I or other people judged her for not being funny, it's that she didn't try to make people laugh to brighten their day. She became upset when she wasn't the focus of the room. And her love of my jokes soon became envy, to where she would roll her eyes at my jokes. Of course I didn't realize it at first. But then, when I pointed out a difference I saw in the music than how we were playing it, she snapped. And told me that I had interrupted the sectional and wasted time. And then she went on after a few more minutes of playing to complain about her roommate to the (forgive the Mean Girls reference) Karen Smith/Gretchen Wieners of the group (to her Regina George)- basically the faithful lackey who developed her college personality around latching on to someone with authority. 

I was shocked. But this was only the beginning, and I gave her the benefit of the doubt. But it got so, so much worse. It devolved into her picking on me every day, calling out mistakes I was making when everyone else had made them, and setting double standards. When I rested my arm on a metal chair on the football field, she told me not to touch sports equipment, but when her lackey or the others rocked the football tackle dummy back and forth for five minutes right in front of her, she did nothing. When an upperclassmen complimented the freshman in the line for learning the routine so quickly, I said thanks, and she snapped at me for talking during the band rehearsal by saying ""shhhh, don't talk during the band rehearsal"". And she turned around and started talking animatedly with someone next to her and I had enough so I shushed her back. She turned around and said, ""That better not have been you!"" 

She told the band director and he called me in. I said, ""So she told on me, huh?"" And that spineless fuck told me, ""No, someone else did."" Like I was that stupid. He refused to do anything even when members of the band came to talk to him in support of me, claiming that he ""was sure we both could line up witnesses against each other"" and that it was just a ""clash of personalities"". I was ""being too sensitive"". He also ignored sexual harassment in the color guard until the offender did something that couldn't be ignored even by him... no trouble for him though. It wasn't his concern to sort out petty squabbles. 

I know I make it sound not so serious but it was EVERY DAY. It was like the teacher in Whiplash, except twice as petty and for absolutely no reason! I was a better player than her, according to the chair tryouts! She made me feel more and more worthless and made me retreat more and more into my shell... the medicine which had worked so well needed to be dosed up, and then changed, but nothing has worked. She would see me close my eyes to hide the tears and tell me ""no sleeping in class"" but when drum majors walked by and I was crying she pretended to be concerned. She called another student a bitch within earshot and made her cry and the teacher knew but didn't do anything about it. 

I had endured bullying my whole life. But it had never made me an empty shell, afraid to be myself. I had been depressed but I never had been convinced that I was the crazy one. I was gaslit to think I was overreacting and weak and oversensitive. I've gone through every medicine, even illegal ones, to try to find something that works but I'm still filled with rage that I didn't stand up to her sooner. But it wouldn't have made a difference. Every time I stood up, I got in trouble. Every time I tried to report her, she acted innocently and they believed her. She's graduated now but it still haunts me. I was so full of life and now I am filled with rage and sadness and emptiness. I could understand the bullies from grade school, even if I couldn't justify them. But her... there was no understanding! Her friends started bullying me because I reacted badly when I learned she had gotten into a car crash. I had never wished ill on anyone but it felt like the only justice. I started crying and cried, ""This is karma for what she did to me!"" They destroyed me. They refused to believe she was evil. They humiliated me and got me kicked out of the group project. They spread rumors about me, even when I apologized for what I said and tried to explain myself. 

I've gone on long enough. What do I do? I want to do what Eminem did and write a song exposing his biggest bully. And when he was sued the court ruled against the bully because it was technically true. This woman is going to become a teacher and work with children, and so are her lackeys. She'll just two-face it to the administration and never get in trouble! But regardless of what happens to her.... what happens to me? 

I have things I want to do, but I no longer feel the drive to do them. Skydiving, which I tried to do to feel something, didn't do anything for me. Going to Germany and finally seeing the castle I'd wanted to see since middle school did very little for my soul. I'm empty, and all I can think about it creating my own society where bullies are kicked the fuck out on the street. I have no tolerance for human cruelty, not that I did before, but I could live my life without worrying about it. But now it's all that occupies my mind. I have shaped myself to become someone who fights bullying in all its forms. I just wrote a book, using scientific and mathematical equations, on how bullies and selfish people are destroying what kind people have created. I think up new plots every day to get her in trouble with her school or the law because karma doesn't always get bad people. I can't let it go... I gave her the best of me and she gave me the ugliest side of humanity. What do I do? Therapy and medicine don't help. Mindfulness didn't work. I hate myself for letting her do this to me, but above all, I hate her. One day I hope the world will confront her for what she has done. I was bullied and abused but I still treat others with kindness. What's her excuse? What's her fucking excuse to do that to me?!"

Two guys at work (who aren't on my team) started joking with me about a year ago. I took it all in jest and laughed with them. As the jokes continued and developed, I started feeling like they are derogatory and even insulting to some degree.

One of them says the same joke every time he sees me (""My day is ruined now!""). At lunch, the same guy always ""jokingly"" tells the people I usually eat with that they will have to wait a long time for me to finish eating (I eat slowly). Things like, ""You guys better leave and come back tomorrow"", ""You should have made him start eating way before you did""... etc.

Both of these guys make regular jokes pertaining to my height (I'm a bit on the shorter side). For example, if I'm talking about having visited a nice bar, they tend to say stuff like ""And did they sell you alcohol?"" I'm also into style so I always come to work in stylish outfits, so they tend to always comment on the way I'm dressed too and in turn make me feel uncomfortable. One recent extremely childish comment by one of them was, ""You might have as well wore mud on your feet."" When I inquired about what the heck he's talking about, he said, ""Your shoes are the color of mud, so why didn't you just slap some mud on your feet and come to work?"" I was wearing brown leather sneakers (quite normal shoes, if only fashionable), so until now I still don't get what was wrong with his head.

Another regular joke is about my driving. It took me quite a while to get my driver's license, so they always say stuff like, ""Did you leave home yesterday so you could get here on time?"" There are more such instances but I can't recall all of them.

I feel like they see me as ""less"" than them, otherwise why would they say such derogatory stuff all the time (even supposedly jokingly)? I should mention that I've always been a ""target"" for bullies. I got bullied a lot during my school years, a bit in college too and now apparently at work as well. I thought that people tend to grow up and become adults at some point and stop bullying and acting like little kids. Looks like this isn't the case.

Does all this even count as bullying at all? Maybe my feeling is wrong and I shouldn't feel insulted by all this? If it's indeed bullying, then what do I do to stop it?"

 They say that we repair ourselves to be better than we used to be. They say that we become stronger. It doesn't always work like that.
Well, I am the living proof that, sometimes, we don't have the chance to get better, no matter how many years fly by. Pretending that everything's okay doesn't get any easier, because we're still afraid of being hurt by their words and physical attacks. In the process of healing, we hurt people who love us. We're angry, and tired of living the same day over and over again. 
To our own safety, we build a safe haven that protects us against the world. Letting someone into our lives is harder than we expect. Those people who hurt us are still the ghosts we see every day and night, making it impossible to move forward without feeling insecure wherever we go.
Those people, if they could be called people, broke me. They touched my soul and injected it with darkness; a type of darkness that flows through my blood as adrenaline, making me be on edge and paranoid whenever I try to interact with another human being. I feel like they know my secret, the one that hurt me the most.
I wish I could forget what happened to me, but as someone said one time when I was younger, sometimes, we never stop being victims. I can't forgive myself for being so weak, so pathetic and useless in front of them. During the times of darkness, the sun is afraid of coming out to the world. I'm the sun. I'm burning so hot that no one dares to get close to me.

Cyber bullying (or any form of bullying, really) doesn't get talked about enough, and in my case, my experience with the police also didn't exactly encourage me to speak up about it further. I resent the fact that it doesn't get taken seriously until someone gets physically hurt, and I also resent that not much can actually be done. BUT I hope that by sharing my story here, it will somehow help others who have found themselves in a similar situation. You are not alone.

&#x200B;

*“You’re the worst. Your mom should have done us all a favor and had an abortion.”*

It all started out as random hateful private messages on Instagram sent by one person from different anonymous accounts. I simply ignored them all, but by the third-month mark, I decided to start blocking these accounts, thinking that it would discourage the person from making additional accounts on Instagram to message me.

I was wrong. New accounts were made, and new messages were sent. I also even received an email from (surprise, surprise) an anonymous email account sent to my public email address. It was like trying to fight a Hydra – cut off one head and another would just sprout anew.

*“You can’t write, you look like an ugly demon and all your posts are contrived, try hard bullshit. Move to LA, or even better – get hit by a truck. The world won’t be missing anything.”*

6 months came and went. I tried contacting Instagram via phone and email – unsuccessfully – and my friends lent their assistance in reporting the list of accounts I had compiled in my Blocked list and screenshot gallery. But since the reporting feature on Instagram gives you limited (and by limited, I mean practically zero) options to explain the situation, and because all the messages I had been receiving (with the exception of the email) were sent privately into my Instagram inbox which I’m assuming Instagram can’t peek at, the lords behind the Instagram sent each of us the same generic message:

“\_\_\_\_, thank you for taking the time to report \_\_\_\_\_’s account. While we reviewed the account you reported for harassment or bullying and found **it does not** violate our Community Guidelines, reports like yours are an important part of making Instagram a safe and welcoming place for everyone.”

Safe and welcoming indeed. I decided to try my luck with the local police precinct, because although no actual threats had been made, I wanted a written record of everything that had been happening. I went prepared with screenshots and time stamps of every hateful, mocking message I had received, and although it took much pestering on my part to convince the officer to read the screenshots, he agreed from the linguistics that they were all sent from the same person, and yet he was painfully dismissive of the situation.

“This is all on Instagram, and there’s no actual threat involved. We can’t do anything about it.”

I’m not sure what I said to finally convince the officer, but he eventually took down an aggravated harassment report.

“Call back in 3 business days to get the case number, then you can try to get in contact with Instagram again and give them that number. Theoretically, Instagram can then look into the matter and block the IP address from creating further accounts.”

I’ll spoil that ending for you right now. I got the case number, and I was able to get a friend who works at Facebook/Instagram to file an internal report with the case number, but it’s either moving along very slowly up the chain or it’s sitting in the system’s Recycle Bin.

A week later, the anonymous hate messages were back, and I met with two more police officers who came over to my apartment to take down notes, except they paid more attention to the two cats in my apartment than to my story.

“OK look,” one of them finally interrupted me. “Celebrities get hate mail all the time. Keanu Reeves probably has a line of people telling him he’s ugly and a terrible actor, but he’s not going to mind them.”

“I realize that, and let me assure you right now that this is not a vanity issue – I couldn’t care less if someone kept calling me ugly. The point here is that this has been going on for almost a year, and I don’t agree with the mentality that nothing can be done until someone actually gets hurt,” I countered. “I know I’m not the only one experiencing cyber harassment. I know this barely qualifies as a drop in the ocean. What I’m asking is simply for you to take down a record of what has been happening because you never know who may get hurt until it’s too late.”

“I agree,” he responded. “But the thing is, this is a city of 8 million people. We have maybe 30,000 police on the force. We have detectives that can easily trace IP addresses for you, but they won’t because the cold truth is that there are bigger issues happening.”

Well there you go. If both Instagram and the police won’t take cyber harassment seriously, who can I turn to then? And now you might also be wondering, “Why don’t you just make your account private?” Perhaps part of the reason can be attributed to pride in that I don’t want the harasser to have the satisfaction of knowing they are the reason for that action, but most importantly, I cannot privatize my account. I’ve always hesitated using the word “influencer” to describe my Instagram presence, but I’ve been fortunate to have ongoing collaborations with brands that require me to keep my account public. And it’s because of this “influencer” nature that I realized something important. In this modern digital age, the internet is saturated with influencers talking about a brand’s new bag line, a revolutionary beauty cream, or even one of those Instagram-bait events. I may not have millions or even tens of thousands of followers, but if I also fall into that bucket, why not use my voice to address and hopefully *influence* an issue that’s so often overlooked?

It crushes me that cyber harassment is an issue that we don’t talk enough about. It infuriates me that it’s brushed off as a trivial matter. I may be able to shrug off these hate messages (which, by the way, have started making their way into the public comments section on my posts) because it’s all libel and false accusations, but I think about my impressionable teenage self, when self-esteem was at its all-time low, and I know there are others in that fragile mental state who are also victims of cyber harassment. It destroys me to think about the lengths they (or even I at 16 years old) might take to hurt themselves as a result of continuous harassment and bullying. Granted, at the same time I realize it’s important to reflect upon the other side of the situation: Those receiving cyber harassment aren’t the only victims. Harassment, especially from anonymous individuals who hide in the digital shadows, stems from a deeply internal mental imbalance, and people like this most likely have been hurt by something that has absolutely nothing to do with their targets. Instead of acknowledging that they need help and asking for it, they take it out on message boards and private inboxes under false names and faceless avatars. In a sense, they too are victims, and if cyber harassment continues to be brushed under the proverbial rug, neither side of the victim spectrum can receive the help that they need.

I hadn’t told my parents about what I was going through because I thought they would be worried for my sake. Instead, when I finally opened up to them, they didn’t have a shred of sympathy to add to my self-pity party.

“Why would you let faceless words weigh you down?” they said. “You know who you are, what you’re capable of, and you know what’s true and what are lies. If you have self-love then it makes those around you powerless over your emotions or thoughts. There will always be people who don’t like feeling that they can’t control you. It’s all the more reason not to give them the power.”

Well said. And now I pass that bit of parental wisdom and some of my own revelations to you.

No matter who or what age you are, if you are experiencing cyber harassment, please do not feel like you are powerless and have no one to turn to. We all have the right to freedom of speech, and it’s a luxury that is unfortunately often abused. Freedom of speech is not an excuse for cyber harassment and digital bullying. It’s not a loophole for attacking thoughts, ideas and opinions without justification, but if there are trolls on the Internet who are taking advantage of their freedom of speech by hurling hateful word vomit at you, it is all the more essential that you turn the tables and take advantage of your right to free speech by using it to facilitate meaningful conversations. I’ve been through that struggle myself – it took me a year’s worth of continuous cyber harassment from the same individual to come forward and speak publicly. The police and Instagram’s reaction (or more accurately, lack of reaction) to my problem certainly didn’t exactly give me confidence to speak out. Ironically, social media platforms were birthed to encourage self-expression, and yet with the onslaught of cyber harassment, we seem to be achieving the opposite effect where victims feel the pressure to remain silent about their situation.

**Moving forward, we can simply continue to report or delete a hateful comment, but all it accomplishes is a temporary disappearing act. The social media platform can block the IP address from creating new accounts, but all that really means is a band-aid over the issue. Raising awareness to a problem requires people talking about it, so for those experiencing cyber harassment, or any sort of harassment for that matter, I hope you’ll find the strength to share your experience like I am doing today. Freedom of speech is not an excuse to harass someone anonymously online, but it provides the perfect opportunity to start a conversation about this severely underestimated issue.**

474,"Joined a guild in an online game, only to get bullied into leaving, but that's not the worst part. Read on.",9,ctcv0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ctcv0t/joined_a_guild_in_an_online_game_only_to_get/,18,1566397489.0,"Sure, this is something that happened online, and I never met these people in real life, but it's still a bullying story which I should share with everyone here. It's one of if not the worst instances of injustice I've ever experienced in 10 years. By the way, if you're too lazy to read the wall of text that will follow, don't worry, I provided a TL;DR version at the bottom to save you time. I promise you, everything in this story is pure truth. Absolutely NOTHING is being exaggerated.

So here goes.

It was a typical day and I logged in an online game called MapleStory 2 (The Korean version, that is. I was in Korea at the time). I was just about to go through my usual grind. Kill monsters, complete quests, all the usual stuff. Then, 20 seconds in, I noticed a message broadcasting to all channels that there's a guild with English-speaking players and are currently recruiting. Me, although I'm of Korean descent, because I grew up in an English-speaking country, my Korean wasn't exactly fluent. So joining any other guild in a Korea-originating game wasn't the best idea due to language barrier issues. So I immediately asked if I could join and I was in. I was looking forward to making new friends without the trouble of language barriers. We hung out, got along, and I was feeling great. All the guild members seemed to be eternal close friends waiting to happen.

A month later, the guild leader asked anyone if they wanted to participate in a PQ (Party Quest). Excited to further develop my friendship with these new people, I immediately agreed to it without a second thought. But here's when the problems started to arise. As soon as I arrived to the PQ's entrance, I said *""I'm here""*, but then this one guy who was with them, whom I didn't exactly recognize, rudely responded with *""No you're not""*. Appalled, I told him off for that disrespectful response but he just rudely made a joke out of it. He was really pissing me off, and it was the last thing I wanted (and expected) from a guild that I had high hopes for. So after the PQ ended I confronted this jerk but no matter how much I told him off for his disrespectful behavior he would just twist it into some joke with some response around the lines of *""Thank you! You're so kind! I love you!❤❤❤""*. I'd tell him he was behaving like a 4-year-old, and he'd twist the words and respond with ""*Yes, that's right. I'm 4 years old. :)*"". He was basically like a hyena. Treated everything like a joke no matter how serious they were.

Later I noticed that he shared a screencap of me telling him off as aforementioned above and making a joke out of it, trying to make me look like I'M the one with the problems, when in reality I was nothing more than a typical player with common sense who suddenly had to deal with a jerk who really didn't deserve to be affiliated with the guild.

So naturally, I complained to the higher people about it and, much to my delight, they immediately called him out on his rude behavior, and he apologized and never bothered me again. And me and everyone in the guild happily moved on and went back to enjoying the game together like normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

...is how I wish this story ended.

No. This is what *really* happened: The people in the guild actually blamed ME. They blamed me for being ""sensitive"" and that this person trying to piss me off was just ""teasing"" me and that he was just ""hardcore as fk"". ~~Why would they tell me not to be so ""sensitive""? Why wouldn't they just tell~~ *~~him~~* ~~to stop being a conceited jerk towards me in the first place? Maybe if they did, said jerk maybe would've apologized, admit that he failed to acknowledge how I felt, and would be a win for me, him, and everyone else in the guild.~~ Okay, scratch that. The truth is, at the time, it wasn't really bullying, the person I just argued with was just being a dick and I overreacted, and I apologized for that. The person I had conflict with...well let's just call him Jacob for now. I remember his IGN and real name, but I choose to withhold that information for the sake of anonymity, otherwise I'd be no better than ""Jacob"" is. Anyhow, Jacob turned out to be one of the top players among the English-speakers, so at the time, I kinda got a little understanding of why he was like that. Even though I still felt pissed, I let it slide.

After that incident, and even though after all those vain efforts in trying to reason with Jacob and his hyena mindset, I still continued hanging out with the guild in the game, as well as in their Discord chat. It was apparent that Jacob was someone I should avoid and that's exactly what I did. I interacted with everyone else in the guild except Jacob. But although he was in my own personal blacklist, I was still willing to give him a chance. Perhaps he will later apologize for being such an insensitive jerk and everything will be okay again. Still, I was reconsidering joining the guild.

And now, this is when everything started to go to shit. After all those days trying to avoid and ignore Jacob, his following interactions with me would finally make me confirm the narcissistic jerk he's always been as well as my reason to leave the guild forever. The guy started to, in Discord, right in open chat where anyone in the guild could notice, throw a bunch of insults at me. Now, prior to this, my dad was aware of my situation and gave me the advice to just play along with this jerk I was dealing with. So when he kept calling me ugly, I just played along with sarcastically concurring responses like *""Yes, I accept without question. I'm so ugly I could be a modern art masterpiece.""* But deep down inside, I was still boiling up and was almost at my limit. And then, Jacob told me that my art sucks ass (Yes, I make illustrations but that's another story), and at that moment, I snapped. I angrily told him to stop this disrespectful behavior at once and he was like *""What are you going to do about it?""* (which would have to be solid indication that this guy really was intending to harass me)*,* and finally, having exceeded my limit and pushed over the edge, I angrily told off all the members for not doing anything about an obvious bullying situation right in front of them before leaving the chat for good. My dad's advice (strangely predictably) backfired.

Now, if you think Jacob was still just ""teasing"", let me explain: If he really was teasing, wouldn't he have apologized by now? And teasing is done among intimate friends, not complete strangers. Also not all interactions would've involved harassing me in some way. I know, I remember a coworker from last year who occasionally teased but he still was cool with me overall. I knew he had no intention of malice. You could say he was basically a Jerk with a Heart of Gold (TVTropes reference). But for the case with Jacob, pretty much *every interaction we had* so far involved him hurting or humiliating me in some way. Jacob wasn't a ""Jerk with a Heart of Gold"". He has never showed *any* behavior towards me that even remotely suggested a heart of gold. He was nothing more than a pure jerk. Plain and simple. And even if Jacob wasn't intending any malice, I still was clearly getting upset over it, and the other guild people should've reconsidered their idea that Jacob's behavior intended no harm. They didn't. Jacob harassed me to the max and somehow they remained convinced that there was absolutely nothing wrong with his behavior.

If you thought Jacob pissing me off to my limit was bad, it gets better. When I angrily told off all the members for their incompetence as I said earlier, they continued to accuse me that I was ""getting angry for nothing"". I kept demanding them that they kick Jacob out and blacklist him permanently like an actual competent guild is supposed to, and they refused, claiming him to be ""important"". They had the choice to do the right thing for the sake of not only me but the entire guild and they instead looked for excuses not to. They were nowhere to be found at my hour of need. I angrily told them I'm leaving them for good, that they're ignorant and incompetent morons who turned a blind eye on obvious harassment, and they just flatly responded with *""Whatever you say""*. It's like they all were on his side the entire time.

I later warned everyone in the game's Facebook page about this guild, not wanting anyone else to get that same horrible experience like I did. The next day, the guild leader noticed and said that I was ""low"" for complaining about their guild on the Facebook page and that she ""\[didn't\] appreciate \[my\] behavior."" (So, they don't notice Jacob's behavior but they notice mine?), then lied that her guild ""works hard and respects one another"", then accused me of ""\[making\] a big deal out of nothing"" (All those times of Jacob bullying me was ""nothing""? Are you goddamn serious?) and ""\[hoped\] for the best"", with an attached screencap of me angrily telling the guild off. (They screencap my messages but didn't screencap Jacob's nasty stuff towards me? I don't even) She was being totally ignorant about a bullying situation that just happened right in her presence then got salty at me just for complaining about it. She didn't even ONCE address WHY I was angry at them, WHY I left them, WHY I made that post in the first place.

I was bullied, and somehow it was all 100% my fault; everyone blamed *me* for it. I was given a good opportunity in a favorite online game of mine, a lot of hopes only to have them all crushed. Absolutely *no one* was on my side that day. Absolutely *no one* was there for me. One would think at least someone would at least come forth and say something like ""Okay Jacob, you've gone too far now, this has to stop or we're kicking you out"". None of them did. *None* of them. They basically let Jacob get away with all that harassment upon me and he didn't even have to take any effort himself. He didn't have to manipulate anyone. He didn't have to feign innocence or shed any crocodile tears. He basically kept openly harassing me right in the presence of everyone yet those people were actually convinced, from the start, that he was just ""teasing"". It's like not just Jacob, but the entire guild was against me. If this guild isn't a Broken Pedestal (again, TVTropes reference) in its purest form I don't know what is.

To this day I can't wrap my head around this. I'm in **ABSOLUTE** disbelief that these kind of people actually exist. Every time I think about it, my blood boils. This is no everyday bullshit people deal with. This is one rare instance where I was actually legitimately angry (for good reason, mind you), and I don't usually react like that when dealing with the more common average everyday bullshit. To this day I'm in absolute disbelief that a guild that claims to be respectful would willingly accept a narcissistic jerk like Jacob, who showed me the exact opposite of respect, because last time I checked, online game guilds aren't supposed to be like this. Or ANY competent social group for that matter. He was openly bullying me right in front of everyone else in the guild and they all downplayed it as a joke; casually just said he was just ""hardcore"" as if all that harassment upon me is totally okay. Then they pretended it never happened to begin with when I started complaining about it. Does this sound right to you? Does this sound like a competent social group to you? Because it's not a joke if the receiving end doesn't find it funny. Their ignorance and wrong choices cost them who could've been a valuable asset to their guild. I gave them several chances and they blew every last one. And they keep wondering why I left them. ""Work hard and respect one another"" my ass.

This is the worst part of getting bullied. Everyone just casually downplays the bullying as ""teasing"" or ""just a little joke"" or some other crap. Which encourages the bullying even more. They're basically saying ""Nah, absolutely nothing wrong with that guy, he's totally A-OK"". You know it's harassment, yet no one thinks so. But when you so much as complain about it, everyone judges you. It beyond sickens me on how some people can harass you all they want yet you're ***NEVER*** allowed to even complain about it no matter what. I don't recall anti-bullying rules saying anything about exemptions being granted.

My one guess is, Jacob just got seriously lucky. If he harassed me like that anywhere else, especially in a more competent social group of any kind that DOESN'T downplay obvious harassment as harmless banter or something, I highly doubt he would've gotten the exact same result as he did in that very guild that kept excusing his supernova of a narcissism.

&#x200B;

TL;DR version:

\- I join guild.

\- I hang out with guild.

\- Jerk randomly starts to be rude to me.

\- I complain only to get blamed for being ""sensitive"" and jerk's disrespectful behavior is downplayed as ""teasing"".

\- Jerk continues harassing, but keeps getting excused.

\- I reach my limit and tell off the guild for their incompetence.

\- I get blamed and accused even more.

\- I leave guild for good.

\- I still get blamed and accused.

&#x200B;

The moral of this story: Don't join online game guilds. Ever. You're better off getting hacked.

And PS, some people actually believe *I'm* the one who bullied Jacob. I kid you not.

&#x200B;

Update: I confronted Jacob recently and guess what: He denied all the harassment and kept lying that he was nice to me in the game the whole time. I knew that guild was keeping a narcissist. I didn't know they were keeping a liar too.

Another additional note: Someone in the subreddit of the game actually had the audacity to downplay Jacob's harassment as a ""harmless joke"". Then accuse *me* of harassing him over that. I think I'm going to get a serious hemorrhage."
475,Improvement,7,csb9or,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/csb9or/improvement/,4,1566212704.0,"6 months ago I posted something along the lines of me getting bullied because of my eczema, it was bad. But recently, it's been getting a lot better, and I don't get bullied for it as often, and when I do I kinda just brush it off with smile and a kind of passive aggressive come back like, bully:""dang bro, your lips are really gross, how do they even get that bad""(my eczema affects my lips a little too) me:"" Idek, they are pretty bad tho, I put stuff on them, but I guess I can barely help it, so its whatever."" And I think I get a little bit of respect because of how chill I am. I also think that another reason I don't get bullied as much anymore is because I've gotten a little more muscular since then, so I'm not skinny, or that my gf is the girl that everyone wants (humble brag) and they don't want to look bad to her. I've improved so much since then, and I am very proud of my self, and my confidence is so frickin high. I had my first ever date last weekend, and it couldn't have gone smoother, we watched two scary movies and then talked for about an hour straight, and I eventually told her about my eczema and other insecurities I had and she said in quote, ""what's so bad about eczema"" That sentence right there is the reason my confidence is so high, it was high before, but when she said that, it went through the roof, now the only thing that makes me insecure is when dudes flirt with my gf, but now I can tell them to back off and they will, I'm happy. ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ"

Why did you decide that they aren't as equal as you?

Why did you have to make their ""most beautiful part of life"" so miserable?

Why did you hurt them? What have they done? What haven't they?

As a formerly bullied child I really fucking want to know why someone in their right mind would think ""hey, let's fuck this kid up for life, it seems fun"". It's all so surreal and merciless. Why didn't you think about the consequences? Why weren't you able to feel something for that poor kid you were terrorizing? Do you ever think about your past actions? Do you feel shame and guilt, or do you get nice and nostalgic? Have you ever apologized? 

Just... Why? Answer me this, please, because I don't know. Maybe it's me, maybe it's nobody. But I guess you just have to blame someone. Otherwise it meant nothing, and it did, because it ruined my life.

Why?"
479,My experiences with bullying,8,c1oruc,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/c1oruc/my_experiences_with_bullying/,2,1560813588.0,"^(really do hope this fits the subreddit)

so, I'm here to tell my bullying stories (I was the target), because I really wanted to post them somewhere to clear my mind and maybe discuss similar situations. (14F, was the ""shy, smart kid"".)

^(also english is not my first language)

Starting in kindergarten, there was this boy about a year older than me that would beat me for no apparent reason. Pushing, pinching, biting. I would tell him to stop and he'd be like ""I'm not doing anything"". Always came home crying. I didn't tell my parents because I didn't know I was supposed to (I was 3). One time, there were some kids running around some sort of concrete statue, playing tag or something alike. I joined. *That* kid was there. He pushed me while I was running and I fell on one of my knees. I still have the scar.

The next year, I got to a new school. Wasn't bullied for a good 3-4 years, until there was a new girl in the class. Let's call her A, and she had a ponytail. We were friends for a while (she was like ""wanna be friends?"" like children do), used to sit on the same table for lunch etc. Gradually, she got new friends and they would avoid me everytime I tried to join the conversation (imagine getting your food, sitting on the table where A was talking to her new friends, then 2 seconds later they all move to a new table and leave you there alone. Rinse and repeat).

Recently I found out that A's family were of some weird religion that had a ""we're better than everyone"" ideology. She started picking on me, along with some friends of hers. At first I responded rudely, but soon learned to ignore it.

Fastforward a few years, I moved to a new school for 6th grade. Another girl wanted to befriend me instantly, I'll call her H, and she was a bit overweight. She soon learned what I really liked (birds, especially cockatiels), what I really disliked (funk music, being the center of attention, getting low grades) and what I was good at (English). So, H and her group made a whole bullying *strategy* to make me the most annoyed as possible: whispering behind me about how weird cockatiels are, blasting funk at full volume, gathering around me and say how much I ""liked"" it, trying to use me to help them with their english homework and telling me to say certain words (""peach"" and ""beach"" because they sound similar to ""b\*tch""), and saying I was going to get bad grades. Sometimes they would jumpscare me and laugh. Sometimes they would make fun of me for not wearing a bra, even though I was a flat-chested plank and it wasn't really necessary. The teachers noticed it but did little or nothing to stop them. I didn't get sad, just deeply annoyed.

After a couple months of telling my parents and teachers and receiving weird advice from them, the only strategy that remotely worked was to ignore them. Welp, it worked for a week, because then they would pick on me for even weirder reasons! Examples: I drew a cockatiel on my notebook. H just stood up, walked up to my desk, said ""*ewwww, cockatiel*"" and went back to her desk. | A friend and I were ignoring the teacher while she was saying what to put in some exercise. He was doodling, I was just spacing out. After the teacher scolded us, H came with her group and picked on me for ""drawing"".

I was so relieved when they finally moved to another school. Then, my father found the *life story* of A and H, and would tell me about it whenever I mentioned bullying. A's ""story"" was just things about her religion, but H's had nothing to do with reasons to bully me. I don't understand.

I've been free of bullying for a couple years now. I'm going to high school next year, and if someone *dares* to try and bully me, I'll just say one of the comebacks I've been preparing for quite some time now and move on with my life. I'm sick of bullying, I won't let it happen again to me or anyone else in my reach.

Thanks for reading. If you want any advice, I'll gladly tell you what I know.

TLDR: got beat in kindergarten, ignored in elementary school and made fun of in middle school. Am willing to give advice."

I am still trying to find my way,  but she makes me feel like giving up,  she treats me like scum.  

She makes constant cutting comments.  Ones that feel like someone just shoved a knife in your gut.  For example, today our mother instead of dealing directly,  made it all us being women and that is not how they act, she goes "" You consider her a woman"" It is cutting because of how much she looks down on me, she has never had a relationship or anything, and acts like I'm this dumb idiot all the time. she will say things like ""ew, your clothes are so plain and boring"", "" Are you not ashamed with the sad life you have"",  "" Go make one friend you loser"" And on and on.  Most of the time I don't take it personally,  and can shrug it off,  because I know I am a kind person who doesn't deserve her bullying treatment at the same time some comments just get to me,  and I don't always feel strong to deal with the hits,  and when I'm feeling a bit down,  they knock me over.  She loves kicking me when I'm already down?  How do I deal with this?"

I am sorry if this post is too small.

Let's just say that the bullying has made me do some bad things, for example, throwing two metal plates at two of the friends I thought I had, one of them landing on a window and breaking it, the other things they've done that made me feel bad was leaving me when we sat down on a max 6 person table during lunch, to go sit down on a max 5 person table, leaving me behind, they have called me things, said things I haven't done, haven't left me alone since grade 8....

Some anxiety definetely come from this, as well as whenever I type this to reddit, I immediately throw it away, because I think that people won't like what I said or won't help me enough.

Again sorry for the small post.... I am now 15, I was 12 during 6th grade.... I have been literally bullied my whole life but this takes the cake. (other things they've done, kicked balls or throw balls, like soccer balls right close to me so they can hit my face with it, have also called me gay)

**YOU**  
**ARE**

**YOU**

Now? I'm a writer. I want to be an author when I grow up. I plan to own a fucking company when I'm older. Every time I see these people who used to bully me in my highschool hallways, I see trouble makers, law breakers, people who do drugs, people who are going to end up in prison someday, while I'm still the kid in the back, dreaming big.  If anyone's going to live on the street when they're older, it's all those people who made fun of me. And I want to scream it from the rooftops to everyone out there who is suffering in the same ways that I did back then, **YOU ARE SOMETHING!**

&#x200B;

So, pick yourself up from the ground. Do something with your life. Become famous, let your name be known, and one day, your childhood bully will look up from their tent at a billboard and see your name, and think:

""Wow. I really underestimated what they were able to do, didn't I?"" And regret their life choices.

On another occasion, he called me fat- which I don't think I am? I only weigh 115 lbs, which is actually kind of low considering my height ( 5.7). I've been dealing with some minor anorexia, and my weight is something i'm really insecure about. He also said my art looked like shit, and no one would ever want to look at it- which is also upsetting because I've been drawing for five years, and pursuing a career in art. I don't think my art is bad- I've been featured in some small gallery shows, so I'm at least good enough to be featured. It just kinda hurts my feelings. Also once asked if I was ""worried I'd fail in my career and end up on the streets because I was a failure"".
I have a good friend in the class who has told him to stop and told him he is being mean- but he keeps on making comments. I have a tendency to be over sensitive, and I am not sure if I am blowing it out of proportion. I have issues with depression and anxiety, and I've made a big deal out of small things in the past.

So much so that I have created an app with only one aim: to provide a safe place to those who would like to share their thoughts without the risk of being bullied or told off.

On this app it is literally impossible to leave negative comments on users' posts, only supportive ones.

When I finaly moved to Sweden I made friend slowly due to my bad self stream. They ended up just full on diching me after a couple of months.

Due to this I don't trust anyone besides close family and if I'm going to share ANY personal stories/info with you, if you are not my uncle or smthn we have to be good friens for about 4 months.

I also have trouble sharing my stuff as toxic friends would ""borow"" my fave items and never give theme back. They would also just steal from me simetimes.

I'm getting better but I still wont tell you my full name or something personal like where I used to live untill we have known eatch other for like half a year AND I think you're trustful.

I also rarely lie to people, even if the truth hurts. Because I know how painful it is to find out someone you care about lied to you."

My name is Ben; I hope you’re all doing well today! 

I am writing to get some help with a bullying situation I have.

I went on to a friend making app and went to the lgbt section. As I joined the first group, I was told I look like I have Down syndrome and that I have a crease on my head someone could jump over. I was made fun of my 2-day unshaven face as well. So, I joined another group. I was immediately told that I looked like a pedophile. A minute later, they said they don’t want a person looking like an abortion survivor on their chat. 

At that point, the tears let loose. I felt so confident going on and meeting people. I knew there’d be bad people, but I didn’t expect to be made fun of every channel I joined. I suffered a brain injury 3 years ago that caused a lot of emotional issues. But I’ve finally grown in how I look and I got dressed up nice and took a picture for the chat app. I guess it’s back to square one. 😢 "

I’m a magician in a restaurant and, for the past couple of months, I’ve been fretting having to go perform there. The reason being is this one regular at the bar who thinks he’s bulletproof and says whatever he wants to me. He’s a wannabe gangster and he always flaunts his finances & always says he’ll burry me alive and give me $20k if I can escape. I keep blowing it off as a joke (which he’s partly doing) and I always jokingly (but seriously) tell him that I’m not an escape artist and I could come to his parties and do card tricks instead.

This guy is sadistic (if you couldn’t already tell). Whenever he’s out with friends, he allows them to insult me: one of his friends once told me I should work at a train station implying that I’m terrible at what I do/I’d never make it big and, last night, someone else told me that he’d burry me with a deck of cards so I could do card tricks. The reason why I keep going up to him to say hello is because I’m afraid of him (I don’t understand how that works but if there’s a psychologist that could decipher the reasoning behind that, thank you!). He also insulted me on my weight last night. Now I’m the first to admit that I’ve lately gained a couple pounds, but I recently started dieting and exercising; the fact that he insulted me about my weight (in one of the rudest, most downgrading ways possible might I add) really put a damper on my evening.

Anyways, I’ve considered quitting there just because of him. I want to stay because the tips I make aren’t the worst! How can I... well... make it stop?

Edit: I could tell the owner, but everyone (and I mean everyone) that works there loves this guy, so it would be nearly impossible to get him barred from entering."

Some of the things they are doing is stealing his stuff from his locker like ipod's, cell phone, flash drives for homework projects, throwing his homework all over the hallway, pissing in his shoe's in his gym locker, grabbing and hand full of his crotch, making fun of him for having diabetes, calling him names and slapping him around.
The thing that worries me the most as from what he's telling me is alot of these people are people he thought of as close friends. Spending the night at these peoples houses.
Little info on my brother, he lives with my mom about 250 miles away from where I live in a lil farming community.  Plays football and baseball.  Use to be on the wrestling and basketball teams.  Doesn't really get to do much as far as hanging out with friends because he lives on a farm and has to take care of the animals.  He's 6ft 2in, 15 yrs old and been diabetic for 8 years.
Now when I was in school I got bullied but not that bad, I just got made fun of for being a nerdy type whose dad owned a pc repair shop and I liked to skip school.
What kinda of advice can I give my brother?  He made my mom promise not to talk to school officials because he knows it will make it worse and my mom still did but they advised her to not let him change schools because these bullys would contact the kids from the new school on facebook and he would get bullied again."

I remember most times if someone wanted to humiliate me or really verbally abuse me,that I thought ""I better let them do this or it's going to be worse."". It's hard to explain. I definitely avoided socializing out of fear of being viciously teased or fear of being physically hurt. But the thing is I had these reoccuring thoughts or something that made me absorb the abuse and not avoid it with any real effort.

I had instances of abuse at home where my grandmother came at me like she trained for a fight. I guess I could've adapted some sort of strategy to maybe roll with the punches and just get to the end of the regular abusive routine. Maybe I've forgotten whatever protection my mind concocted to get thru my stepfather's daily beatings.

Maybe I have a memory inside myself of a really intense trauma that I was trying to avoid. I did have regret after a bully would insult me and I didn't take action. I had this sense of a kind of immorality after a beating or a tirade from my grandmother intended to harm me. I might have had something of a defense albeit a lackluster one but I most oftenly just gave in to what the abusers wanted.

I just thought what it could have been to make myself accept all this terrible abuse. Where did that acceptance come from?"

I was a shy kid but would open up when I was comfortable around people. My best friend fell into the wrong group and started bullying me with them. I felt portrayed by him and it was 3 vs 1, I just felt so lost. My friend who I walked to school with would rather go and hang out with the more cool kids. This stopped in year 9 when I finally told my parents and the school but it left it’s impact. I had no self esteem or anything, that then led to this other guy badly bullying me in year 10 and 11, then nearly the whole year group of boys would at some point bully me. I was weak and I couldn’t defend myself against everybody I was scared. I sheltered myself in videogames and I have a very loving family. 

I remember on the last day of school, we didn’t have to go but I went with my ‘new best friend’ the guy I walk to school with as he wanted to go. Nobody signed my shirt apart from somebody putting “kick me I'm a ****” on the back. My best friend then left me after school. He says to me to this day he didn’t realise he even walked to school with me on that day. I found out he walked home with some ‘cooler kids’ I literally waited for him for about an hour and he just left me. 

I have forgiven my old best friend the one who bullied me. He has since apologised more than once. He is the only one to ever apologise to me and he was sincere in it, and we talk sometimes. I have let that go. But the year 10 and 11 bullying has somehow never left me. The mental impact it has left has stayed with me. I don’t no how I can leave it behind. Trust me I want to move on and I want to leave it. But it seems to have left a lifelong impact on me like it’s shaped me into who I am. I don’t hate myself but it’s like I’m in a shell. I don’t want to get close to people and I just stay in all the time. How can I change myself mentally."

 **Back then** 

  
 Back then   
I felt   
betrayed   
helpless   
ashamed   
having  
little money   
lots of bullies   
one friend   
reading between the lines of what people said   
helped me to survive   
being bullied is hard   
\-   
hearing all the negative words over and over again in your own head is a lot harder   
and reading between the lines   
after bullying stopped   
can destroy your life   
long afterwards   
the shame stays   
the helplessness stays   
deep inside   
yourself   
 

in a place you cannot reach while conscious   
it is called the amygdala  
 part of the brain hidden very deep   
once useful     
for the     
fight or flight state   
when facing a tiger it now     
slowly     
eats me up from inside   
at least it tries   
   
until i learned to separate those negative voices   
from myself   
and see them   
as what they are   
small but powerful    
enemies   
inside myself   
    
leftovers originally     
created by bullies   
but fed by myself with more insecureness   
more helplessness   
    
pushing my happiness away further and further   
from myself   


for a while it came back   
happiness   
after school i felt relieved   
all the bullying finally stopped   
 and there was hope   
people would finally like me for who i was   
    
and it became true for a while   
and i knew i could be happy   
 those voices just stopped   
and i was happy   
i was myself   


until pressure for success came   
i never doubted my abilities   
until i felt i need to prove myself   
to show everyone how wrong they where   


until then all was good   
    
what started little became big   
but this time i started it myself   
did i miss the bulling?   
Was this normal now?  
 Did life feel too easy? Why?     
Did i start manipulating myself?  
 Because i could not stand to be happy?   
    
Felt i didnt deserve it? Why?   
Those voices came back even     
without outward starters this time   
not by others but by myself   
i cannot blame anyone else  
not this time   
  the only thing that happend     
was me thinking i dont deserve   
to be happy   
  when did that thought start? And why?  


My life went well;   
all was good   
Studies; love; friends   
but i didnt want to believe   
that i deserved it   
 all my live i heard from my peers   
at school laughter   
about cloth being uncool   
i heard bullies making fun of me   
my thoughts, my words,

and now   
i   
had turned   
into   
my own   
bully   


 the very person    
 that i hated most   
now lived inside me   
at least the voice   
reading between the lines of every sentence -which once saved me-   
now destroys relationships that i would like to be smooth   
at work   
with friends   
with my     
siblings and parents   
because unless i am perfect   
i feel i am not worth it   
my mind knows nobody is perfect   
but i feel i still have to be – or defend myself all the time   
    
But now finally i am working hard   
I have forgiven my bully  
as i understand today he was scared himself  
I am working hard  
on understanding what happend and how i can     
finally become myself again   
    
myself without fear of judgement   
of judgement from myself   
and from others   
 when i reach that state     
i will be happy   
and make sure to not loose it again   
    
its called acceptance and i am getting closer   
i will stay strong     
and learn every day   
will you join me on my journey?"

I’m a physics major voice performance minor (this comes into play later). One of the people in my friend group who we’ll call Natasha has been starting to poke fun at me more and more.

The first time I ate with a fork and knife in her presence, I hear her start giggling and proceeds to tell me I’m doing it all wrong. I play along. I’m not against self-deprecating humor. But then it just keeps going. And going. 

If I accidentally drop my water bottle, she snaps at me “ironically.” If I sing “too good” in music theory lab sight-singing, she makes some comment like “alright, OP.”

She does this with other people too. For example, for one of my other friend’s birthdays, she told his girlfriend to take him out of the room because the cake wasn’t lighted yet. His gf took him to the 3rd floor and the wax from the candles melted all over the cake. 

Not a big deal, it was a homemade bday cake and it’s the thought that counts at our age. She proceeds to chew them the fuck out and doesn’t let it go. 

That same person also has a physical disability that causes him to not be able to tolerate loud high-pitched noises. She has complained to me about him asking for volume to be turned down on more than one occasion.

I was just getting over my self-consciousness about all this shit, but I dread seeing her because I know I’ll be called out for something."

You perceived yourself as a victim retaliating against your bully, but the school perceived it as someone bullying another over ""just playing around"", hence, the school does nothing about the bullying, because they believe it's ""just playing around"", and punishes you instead of the actual bully because they actually believed someone is being bullied over what was supposed to be legit bullying, but was instead downplayed as something harmless.

Henceforth, I prove with the above that the ""Bullying is unacceptable is the biggest lie ever made in schools"" thing is a fallacy, otherwise you wouldn't have gotten in trouble either when you ""bullied"" your bully.

It's not that they're lying about stopping bullying, it's that they acknowledge not the one who starts the harassment first, but the one who REACTS to said harassment as bullying. This logic is obviously flawed."

The only year that he was able to get through without incident was his 7th grade year when I was a teacher at his school. I was fortunate enough to teach at a new Middle School that he transferred to recently for his 8th grade year as well. 

I thought we'd continue the success from 7th grade but the bullying started almost immediately. At first it was name calling and then it progressed to social isolation. **The last incident occurred during recess when another student walked up to him with a noose that was made out of twine, handed it to him, and walked away.** This particular student happened to be on the student council and was a member of the school's sport's team. The student was given a one day suspension and removed from student council. 

My son was told by his therapist to keep a journal and write down what he would say to the bullies if they continued to bother him. When another student saw this, they told the principal and his teachers that he was making a hit list. I was pulled out of class to discuss this and he was made to feel like he was a threat to other students almost immediately without investigation into why he was doing this.  

He's very artistic and incredibly intelligent and empathetic for his age. He draws comics and has interests in history, politics, historical figures, and art and has memorized hundreds of hours of information on WW II, WW I, and Greek Mythology. He often draws highly detailed battle scenes from the Civil War and often makes comics involving modern day politics that reference gun violence in America. 

Recently with the Say Something program that's being rolled out, a student downloaded the App and reported him for drawing violent scenes that he actually didn't draw depicting hanging and death and once again said that he had a hit list. This program seems to be another way for students to bully other students and they can now do it anonymously. 

I just received an email from the Admin that he must be cleared by  his therapist before returning to school. I work at the school. I was hired this year and must now find a way to home school my son because he no longer feels safe and feels that he will be targeted by students who don't like him using this Say Something App.  

Yet another example of how schools are routinely failing the children they are supposed to protect."
527,How i conquered bullying ( advice),8,dqvsw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dqvsw1/how_i_conquered_bullying_advice/,2,1572784199.0,"Sometimes I think that I had been one of the most bullied humans on earth. But today I am far away from such mishaps. The advice I can give is that"" IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU SEE YOURSELF AND LOVE YOURSELF"".

It is very difficult to act if one sees themselves below par. So either, one has to build themselves up or learn to act.

It is very difficult to act, in my opinion.

People who are assholes pick on everyone. But the weak respond in a way that makes them to be picked up again and again.

What worked for me are these things:-

1. I learnt to observe these great humans who bullied me. If they were worth the salt, would they steep down to hurt another human? No, they were below par.
2. I learnt to observe myself.
3. when I observed myself ( believe me, I never gave up, that is the trick; learning from mistakes even while you forget a 1000 times), and  I learnt the way to ignore these assholes. "" I USED GREY ROCK TECHNIQUE AND I IMMEDIATELY REMEMBERED MY PASSIONS, THE WORK I NEED TO COMPLETE IN MY PASSIONS""
4. Sorry for the brag that will follow, but I need to say this because, when one observes oneself and others objectively, it could be also deep set jealousy that provokes assholery.  I understood that I was being too soft and humble so as to make others comfortable. This made it easy for every Tom, Dick (pun intended) and Hairy to pick on me. So slowly I developed the countenance I should portray when someone crosses the limit. Again, I failed 1000 times, but I rose up.
5. When I saw how bullying had made me lose my self-worth and destroyed my life, I almost became suicidal. Then, wisdom prevailed. I read and saw people who had achieved great things under the most awful circumstances in later years of their life. This sustains me. So I have made it a habit, to read about high achievers, every day. I took stock of my advantages life has offered me and saw that probably they might not be physical assets in the form of money or land, but were indeed awesome gifts to use and help others.

So my advice would be that:-

 1) IMPROVE YOUR SKILLS, KNOWLEDGE, HEALTH, AND PHYSIQUE.

2) CONCENTRATE ON YOURSELF AND YOUR PASSIONS

3) USE GREY ROCK METHOD TO IGNORE ASSHOLE AND IMMEDIATELY  REMEMBER YOUR PASSIONS.

4) PEOPLE ARE NASTY USUALLY  BECAUSE THEY HAVE LESS SELF WORTH, SO OBSERVE THEM AND LAUGH AT THEM AND ENJOY YOUR WORTH"".

BEST OF LUCK!"

This has been happening for almost 2 years, at first it just seemed like he was joking around with my height (I’m 4’11) but it continued, so being annoyed with the constant what’s up shorty and the similar lines, I asked him to stop but it continue. It didn’t bother me to much as it has been some I have heard from primary school but it was how constant it was that got to me like I’ve heard this all before please stop. Then late last year I’ve I had a number of medical issues occurred (all to do with my stomach and throat)  and because of this I started hiccuping after eating and drinking certain drinks, he thought it would be funny to poke fun at that and I have told him to stop as this is a sensitive topic for me, once again he ignores this and continues. It’s all just getting to me and I don’t know what to do, friends have told him to stop because it’s not funny and it’s upsetting me but that doesn’t seem to bother him and I nervous that he will get worse if I go talk to a teacher.

I'll admit at first, I was gullible enough to believe it and thought the problem was in me. But now I realize bystanders (and especially affiliates of the one doing the bullying) are just using it as an excuse not to acknowledge that this person has serious problems and reconsider any ounce of unwarranted respect they have with this person.

By describing any kind of intimidating or harassing behavior as ""tough"" or ""hardcore"", you're basically implying that said behavior is totally acceptable and there's absolutely nothing wrong with this person...obviously borderline bullshit. You're only encouraging the harassment more because now you just confirmed in the bully's mind that they'll face absolutely no consequences.

Because last time I checked, those two words mean ""brave"" and ""fearless"".

Proper use:

""Our local firefighters could withstand any amount of heat or smoke just to save lives.""

""Yeah, they're really tough/hardcore.""

Misuse:

""Ever since I got hired, this co-worker has been harassing me.""

""Stop being sensitive, he's just tough/hardcore.""

539,I know my former bully's Instagram and It is destroying my perception of myself.,7,d8xc4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/d8xc4p/i_know_my_former_bullys_instagram_and_it_is/,31,1569408726.0,"I'm new to this subreddit, but anyway there was this girl who hated ever since I first stepped into that new school.

Let's call her Shania. On the very first day, I was welcomed by a group of girls, they seemed extremely nice and so they decided to let me sit with them. Among them, was a girl named shania. Shania, was acting very strange towards me the first day. She would be in the corner of the classroom and just stare intently at me, her blue eyes would just peer out from behind her bangs. I thought nothing of it, until I started hearing people talk about me.

Eventually rumors that were completely untrue and outrageous spread like wildfire across the WHOLE SCHOOL! I was devastated and I felt really scared to be in the same building as all those teenagers. In fact I was recently diagnosed with ptsd from all that bullying. I can hear someone laughing or talking and I will become ridden with terror. I won't want them to see me face and I often run out of there (Grocery store, mall anywhere) as fast a I can in hopes that I won't have to hear what they say about me. I am actually afraid of adolescents and teenagers when I, myself am 20 years old. 

I recently went to see a psychiatrist and he changed me to a different med and everything changed! I was energized, happy and not afraid. I still am! : ) Though certain things that trigger me still get to me, like mean people and hearing people laugh. (Medication can't solve everything, Unfortunately) (they get to me, just not as much)

Anyway, out of curiosity, I went on internet search and found my bully's Instagram. Her life is so much better than mine at the moment. She has so many friends, and what bothers me the most is that one of my former friends from second grade liked her post saying she looked cute in it. Some backstory: IN 2011, when I was still in school, I got into a fatal accident that involved head injury and a gash on my face. I got a concussion and was unable to go back to school for a while.

I went back the next year and she was STILL being mean to me. She made a scene so that she could sit at the empty desk in front of me. Everyone else was being nice to me,but her and her group of friends. They started whispering amongst each other ( obviously about me) in front of me because my desk was right behind theirs. Then, they started asking me seemingly innocent questions. One of them she asked, whether or not i was planning on staying at this school or homeschooling. Well, I made a bad move and said I was going back to woodland park high school. The exact year, she transferred to my school. It was in her post. She graduated thespian of the year and there are actually some pictures she has of my former classmates and her in the car eating fast food and having a good time. These were kids I knew from elementary that she made friends with. I don't know what she told them, but the good thing was that I was online schooled and never saw or knew about her until I graduated and saw her insta of course.

There's a quote on her instagram that says she believes in the standing up for others (who are being bullied). It makes my blood BOIL! That is so wrong especially since she had a history with bullying me and she TRIED to bully me AGAIN.

Well now she has a boyfriend and a life in general and I have social anxiety, no job or no permit. The great thing is that these meds are REALLY helping. (I have bipolar), but the thing that sucks is that I'm so behind!

With her instagram there, I often find myself comparing our pictures, our looks I mean. She's successful and I feel like, I'm not and that I have to measure up to her. I REALLy want to measure up to myself and compare myself with who I was years ago. That's what I should be doing! I'm smart (I once got on honor roll), I have a will (I lost weight) and I can write, but I just can't see those things with this constant comparison. How do I stop going on her instagram and comparing myself? I will talk to my counselor about this, but the appointment isn't till the first week of October!

Please give me some advice and Thank you for reading.

I was always scared to go every day after school. It started getting worse when the attacks weren't physical. They were verbal. I was in first grade and I was shy and sensitive. I didn't have the highest self-esteem then. Looking back on it now, I realize why I never beat my opponent in karate. It's not because I wasn't strong enough to beat my opponent.

I died in the game and said “fuck” nothing too bad right? Wrong 

He took it upon himself to make my life a living hell, he told most of my friends lies to make me look horrible and bad, he Harassed me online and at school and told my friends and other people to bully me,

I was studying abroad and there was only one other guy who shared the same nationality as me. Naturally we became friends. One night, we decided to have a sleep over at his place. And it turned into a heart-to-heart talk. After I poured my heart out for this first time ever to a guy, he said ""You should have fought. I was a shy kid. I was so very shy. But I got over it!""

Boom, I was shocked. I expected, idk, empathy and understanding? I mean good for you that you conquered your shyness and enjoy school popularity and have all that amazing HS memories. I fucking don't have that. I am not you! From that point on, I did a shitty thing. I brushed off everytime he said how homesick he was and how lonely he was without his girlfriend or how he wanted to dump his ldr gf and get a local gf (he never did, he said some sleazy thing but ultimately a faithful guy). And I deluded myself into thinking I didn't have the same homesick feeling.
But the worst thing was, I did open up myself to this guy, and I fell in love with him. I fell in love with him not for who he is but simply because he was the first guy I talked my feelings  with. And that was horrible. I spent half a year being depressed. I even tried to turn to Jesus to cure my gayness. It lasted about 2 hours, couldn't believe in Jesus after all even if I wanted to lol.

I can't open up to anyone now, maybe except girls. 

Also, schools suck, schools should focus on helping kids and teenagers mature. People should expect more maturity from teenagers. You know what teens want? Respect from their peers and the irony is they suck at giving respect to each other. For the longest time I thought male friendship could only be built by putting down each other. It's fucked up and if you display discomfort, they just say you are oversensitive. Hahahaha, too sensitive. Yeah, right."

I'm not too sure where else to post this at this point but just need to get it out. I do live in the UK so this might be confusing for others. I am really sorry for the length but it had to be said. 

I had moved from one place to another, which meant different school and new people. This was my chance to be happy as I had been bullied my entire life. It didn't get better. I was mocked, kicked out of clubs for being odd and made fun off for being the quiet one. Fast forward a few years and it was still going. It was my final school year (Yay!) and everyone was prepping for Formal, speeches from teachers and all, our 6th year day out and the year book. During that time, the bullying had almost stopped and I felt like they had grown up. But things couldn't be much further from that. 

Formal was horrendous. As we were getting our photos done, someone pulled my headpiece out and pulled my hair extentions off while another called me a pigs in blankets because my dress was tight fitting. It was a disaster and I starved myself for a week straight. 

On the very last day, when all 6th years would go out to an amusement park, certificates were handed out to everyone, labeling everyone as something. All of them were funny and everyone had a laugh...except for me. All my bullies and people who didn't know me made a completely separate certificate labeling me the Most Weird. Now...i know I am weird, my friends call me weird but that's all in a good laugh...being called weird by THEM killed me. I walked off the bus and told them to take their trip and shove it up their a**. Soon after everyone was invited to a group chat to go to an after party. Deep down, I do really regret saying this but at the time and even now, I enjoy watching and reading their replies. Bare with me here as I am no longer apart of the group chat so this is from what I can remember saying.

""Don't invite me to anymore of your group chats. It is very clear what you think of me. You never meant anything to me. All of you made my life hell. If I see you in the street, or out in town and you approach me, I will flat out ignore you and pretend I don't even know you. I hope, no I pray, that I die today so I can blame all of you. Get off of your high horse and realise that you are sick, disgusting monsters. I hope you're proud of yourselves. See you all in Hell""

I left the group chat and sat in the toilets, crying my eyes out as my friends message me, asking where I was.

That was a year ago. I'm 19 years old now. Today, things have been brought up again. I joined a dating website and got a message from one of the people who didn't necessarily like me but tolerated me. He asked why I had a full blown meltdown and told everyone I was going to kill them. It stung, knowing fine well it was them twisting everyone around their finger but I just moved on.

Right now I just need reassurance that what I said was the right thing to say to them. When they do approach me, especially in nightclubs, I just ask them if I know them when they say my name. It gives me some sort of adrenaline, seeing the look of confusion and hurt spread across their face. Am I becoming one of them? Should I apologise for my words a year ago? Should I just try and ignore them?"

I want to try to give away as little information as I possibly can, in case that anyone somehow figures out who I am in this post.

So, I attend a college, and I am part of this class (don't want to mention it). In this class, you spend a lot of time with 30-40 people. One of them was really friendly at first. But after that, I had a feeling in my gut that they didn't like me and hated me. It must be true, because this person constantly ""joked"" about stabbing me. Now I am afraid to go back to this class next semester because of him.

The first instance came after me and a few other students grabbed lunch together. I said something insensitive to him on accident, not realizing the way I came across. His response was that he will stab me, take my wallet, and donate the money to the poor.

Another time grabbing lunch, I made a remark to the other students about how we are basically a family at this point, and I heard one of the other students say ""we don't stab our family"". I know that he was talking about me.

This changed into actually pretending to stab me, and I am not sure if this can count as assault. I didn't take this as seriously as I should have. While we were side by side at one point, he pushed his hand into my side, closed-fist.

There was another time not long after that incident where he walked straight up to me grinning from ear to ear, and he pushed his hand into my stomach and back out, I asked him why he kept doing this, and he just stood there smiling, not saying anything.

Another time, he straight up told me that ""I was hoping that you'd die from that (not going to mention it here)"".

Through the grapevine, I know that this guy has some issues in his private life. I kind of shrugged it off as him joking, but upon recent reflection, I realize that this might be more serious than I realize. What if he actually does stab me? I unfortunately didn't get any audio/video footage of him doing these things. What should I do?

Also, I think I recall him ""joking"" about that to one or two other people before, but it seems like it was mostly about me."
551,Help,6,c02kvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/c02kvr/help/,3,1560438049.0," So lately (the past few months), I've been the victim of bullying by an online group of people. They play on the Minecraft server I play on and are good friends with a lot of my friends. They've been saying things about me in public chat, like saying I send nudes to people (I don't), calling me slurs that I can't say here, saying I ask everyone if they want my nudes, saying I'm lying about my sexuality, saying I smell bad (I know that's childish but when its repeated a thousand times it hurts), etc.

I report them to the staff on the server and they get onto the group but after a couple of days, it starts back up again. I just don't know what to do. The only reason I even stay on the server anymore is that I have such good friends there and I (mostly) love the community. The staff has threatened to ban the players who do it but even one of the staff members is in their group chat and engages in the shit talking.

I just feel like it won't ever stop and I'll be forced to leave, which I REALLY don't want to have to do.

I should also point out that I have done absolutely nothing to them and they are just attacking me specifically for no reason other than I'm ""ugly"" and ""fat"". Dear god it pisses me off so much I just needed to rant somewhere.

Any advice as to how to deal with this is welcome and appreciated."

a few years back we had a change of teacher and the new teacher is strict af compared to the previous one who was more lenient. this new teacher had zero tolerance for stupid mistakes which i often made as I'm a slow learner in a kinetic aspect. (my eye-movement coordination sucks and i cant differentiate my right from my left), so she often chided and subtly ridiculed me in a condescending manner. This happened for the last few years and I just sucked it up as I assumed that it was for the best learning outcome.

however, my classmates were all now more skilled and learn faster than me, so they took it upon themselves to give me dirty  and irritated looks bc the teacher had to repeatedly explain to me the steps and the entire class had to redo the steps together with me, although i was the only one lagging behind. 

my self esteem had already sunk to rock bottom, but this incident triggered past trauma and right now the effects of ptsd is slapping me on the right cheek. 

i cant change the fact that im a slow learner in terms of dance, but im just afraid that i will not have the mental capacity to withstand this kind of humiliation and patronization any longer.

help? anybody?"

A girl named Judy would taunt me every chance she got. She also got other girls to bully me. Everyday life was terrible for me. I hid my pain from everyone. If I had gone to my mother she wouldn't of done anything anyway. When I was fourteen, I tried to take my own life. And, still no one did anything. My mother was actually angry with me for trying to kill myself. She shut down around me and basically ignored me.

It has been many years since I was in school and I still have trouble making friends with other women. I feel like everyone hates me and when I lose another friend I just shrugged it off to the past. I feel like I will never be any good at having women friends."

557,Medical Doctor wants me to leave Work because of Bullying,7,bnldzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bnldzc/medical_doctor_wants_me_to_leave_work_because_of/,5,1557665589.0,"Hello,

&#x200B;

I've worked for a company for the past nine years (since age 18) and have experienced bullying by several coworkers consistently over that time frame. One of the bullies/harassers is a middle age-to-older man who is very sarcastic, opinionated, and mean-spirited to myself and others. I've always been very polite to him but my kindness is only met with even more obvious disrespect and abuse. 

&#x200B;

 Because this company is my first long-term job and I've been with the company for a while it has 1)killed my confidence 2)made me bitter and contributes to my dysthymia (what doctors call long-term depression) 3)made me think I've wasted what should be the best years of my life(my early to mid 20s) to a vampire of a company 4)made me INCREDIBLY LAZY by zapping me of mental strength to look and apply for new jobs. My partner says half of what comes out of my mouth some days is complaints about some irritating or harassing comment or rude behavior by a few coworkers. 

&#x200B;

I've gone to HR to complain at the recommendation of my parent about a manager who told a couple of my other coworkers and a different manager that I ""have a major chemical imbalance"" and am mentally ill. The morning before I met with HR to follow-up with her, I went straight to my doctor about this and he said ""f-them, that's a lawsuit. Someone like that should be terminated immediately."" HR did not fire this manager and since then her and her sometimes even meaner coworker friends are retaliating against me by being snippy or condescending.

&#x200B;

Mind you, it is not the job itself, it is few people who have no manners, gossip and bitch constantly. Working with people who surely internally wish for your social/professional demise is mentally draining. I feel like this company has stolen from me by destroying my peace of mind by letting a nasty old-cactus act-out with impunity. Worse, I've seen other people terminated by the same company for less offensive behavior or trivial mistakes. If I put the energy and money into it, I could sue my current employer (according to my doctor, I haven't consulted a lawyer). From what I've read, companies bank on peon-type workers like myself to not bother trying to sue or for me to leave on my own. My doctor's advice is for me to leave the company for my health's sake. 

&#x200B;

This whole nightmare of a job-situation has made me feel helpless and defeated and therefore even angrier and even more depressed which makes me even lazier. 

I don't feel excited or optimistic about life anymore and there are times when I am overwhelmed with rage. I think a lot stems from being jerked around at work and previously at high-school by a few peers (college was a actually a pretty chill time and professors (that I've had) were brilliant and wonderful folk)."
558,Bullied my entire life,7,bki5m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bki5m3/bullied_my_entire_life/,10,1556978583.0,"The bullying started in middle school.  It was mild, but the beginning of what would consume my entire life.  In high school the bullying started up again x100.  Every single day they would make fun of my appearance.  They would call me Asian, Mexican, etc (I'm white.  They were referring to my large head and cheekbones.). Sometimes I would enter a room and somebody would be so upset about my ugliness they would start screaming and getting angry.  I even had teachers who would give me angry looks because of my appearance.  

Things stayed the same outside of school.  In my 20s I would go to bars.  I had friends who would get girls easily.  Me?  I was always shut out.  Girls would give me looks like I'm hideous.  I even had one girl RECOIL because of how ugly I am.  She literally jumped back with a look of disgust on her face.  

&#x200B;

Now I'm in my late 20s.  I've never kissed a girl or had a girlfriend.  It's hard for me to go out because I know I'll see reflections of myself somewhere.  I literally cannot live because of how ugly I am.  It prevents me from moving or even seeking a job, because I'd rather die.  The depression stops me from trying at life.  

What's worse it has destroyed my family life too.  I can't look at my sister because she looks too much like me.  I can't love life.  I can't have a life at all.  I've never ""had my fun"" as the saying goes.  I've never really had friends.  This has truly ruined my life.

After a year or so I realized my self-esteem was really crappy due to the negative criticism and public humiliations my “friends” put me through. 
That’s when I decided to stay clear of them and lose contact. 
One day I was on my way home and I was ambushed and evidently jumped by my old pals and 2 other guys. 
I took the beating carried on thinking I’m finally out of that circle and can get on with my life. But things just got worse, the next time I saw them they tried to intimidate me, I stood up for myself and fought back.  Later that night a group of people banged on my moms door, when I opened it I almost caught a heart attack to find my old circle and a few other guys outside threatening to smash up windows with bricks and stabbing whoever was inside the house. This event has left me with tremendous amount of trauma knowing my family’s safety was in jeopardy just because I made friends with the wrong people years ago. 

It’s been years since this event took place, but I sometimes still see them around. Nothing has changed really they’re still the evil bullies they were in school. 

I can’t keep living in fear no more, i genuinely feel like I’m at the end of my rope. But I know if I retaliate in any way it’s gonna come back on my family. I know where they live and I’m at the point where I’m thinking about throwing my life away just to put an end to them. 

If anyone reading this far is wondering why none of this was ever reported to the police, it’s because my city don’t work that way. Any form of snitching would come back straight on my family.

I am a counselling psychology doctorate student at University of East London (UK).   As part of my studies I am conducting the research on bullying and self-harm and i am interested in your voice!!

**What is the research?**

I am conducting a qualitative study on the experience of young people who have previously been bullied and self-harmed   (not currently doing so) while being at school. 

I am interested in understanding how participants of this study make sense of their past self-harm while they were bullied and what their previous self-harm means to them. 

This will be done by individual interview with participants which I will then analyse and interpret.

I was bullied throughout my teen years, sometimes I feel my life is normal, others I feel really messed up and I'm sure it's changed how I interact with other people.

I've learnt to give as good as I get, when attacked and I can be a bit no holds barred (only verbally, never been in a fight as an adult), I struggle to see everyone as a worthwhile human being and when I feel threatened by someone I find myself wishing I could just crush them like a bug.

The problem is a lot of people dont get it, they think I'm too harsh or say it makes me just as bad and a bully myself.  I disagree with the latter, I'd never go out of my way to be mean to someone for the sake of it, I don't think I'm a cruel person and I don't like drama.  I just don't see why I should bend over and buttsuck some nasty person just so people dont consider me a bully.

I've decided it's better to just be fake, act like I'm not bothered by other people being nasty to me and pretend their behaviour is ok just for the sake of social acceptance.  I resent it though, I hate having to pretend."

They’re jealous of them

They have a crush on you(mainly to get their attention) 

They have something wrong with them (like a disability or something like that) 

Appearances

I try to look back in the last and think have I ever bullied someone even without knowing I was making someone feel bullied when I was a lot younger 

And when I reached secondary school oh I was bullied soo bad and when I look back I think it’s out of jealousy I was bullied by a few people like a girl who was morbidly obese, a girl who looked more like a man and yet I never pointed those things out to them as I didn’t want to stoop to their level and I was mostly afraid they’d bring a gang and beat the crap out of me

-I have bipolar disorder 
-I have attempted suicide (though I will not go into detail about it)
-I have been to psychiatric hospitals 
-I am female
-This took place during middle school at a small charter school (90 kids per grade)
-I am currently in a different high school 

I had been going to this charter school since 2nd grade, and I knew everyone. But things changed after I attempted suicide. After I got out of the hospital I told only my closest friends, and lied to everybody else. Then, somehow, someone told everyone the truth. I still don’t know who, but I don’t care anymore. Anyways, the truth came with a bunch of uncomfortable questions, and a lot of bullying. The most prominent memory of said bullying was being on a school field trip, and this group of guys in my grade screamed, “Run away from her, she’s going to kill us!” or “Look, a psycho!” every single time they saw me. It broke me, and I had to go inpatient, and I was away from school for months. When I came back I wasn’t confident, but I knew how fake it, and I came up with steps that I still use today when being bullied. 

Step 1: Ignore them, act like you don’t care.
Step 2: With A BLANK EXPRESSION, and NO TONE tell them to knock it off or something similar.
Step 3: Threaten to turn them in/threat authority (don’t actually say threats or you will get yourself in trouble)
Step 4: Use what they say against them. I say, “You keep calling me a psycho, and you know I’m in the gifted program. Do you really want to get on the bad side of a genius psycho? Because maybe I am a psycho. Messing with a psycho is never smart.” Notice how I did not directly threaten them. I NEVER said, “I’m a psycho who can and will hurt you if you cross me.” because that will get you in trouble. Just state facts and use their words against them.
Step 5: Tell someone if it’s really that bad.

It worked for me. Maybe it can work for you.

571,My Personal Story of My 1.5+ Years of Being Bullied,7,awbifp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/awbifp/my_personal_story_of_my_15_years_of_being_bullied/,1,1551513742.0,"So, as of right now (the year 2019 {a.k.a. when I wrote this}) I am in the 8th grade and 14 years old. Back when I was in 4th and 5th grade, I was bullied by two people. Understand this, my principal at the time was a f\*cking **NUN**, so you can guess what happened.

I also censored a few bad words (just put a \* there) just for the little kids who have happened to look here. And I'm sorry, but this is quite a long story at 2,269 words.

&#x200B;

It was 2 months after the 2015 school year started for me, and I was having fun with my new friend (as I arrived a year earlier and had very few initial friends), and my school has this ""Elite Eagles"", where a student from each grade who followed our religious virtues would receive awards and recognition for being a school role model, I was picked, and my mom accidentally told me, so I walked to school in a good mood. I saw the bully, let's call him SLD (Sh\*tty Little D\*ck), and I instinctively lose my happiness. He had been teasing me earlier that month for no apparent reason.

&#x200B;

As I was called up to receive my award, few people cheered (obviously my friends did 'cause they actually gave me more than a shit). This was because very few people knew me well. We walked back to class, and then sat down to prepare to move to our classes after we switched. Our teacher left since there was someone who needed to talk to her.

Then, SLD said aloud, ""Hey Ray\_RG!"" (not saying my name), ""You won AGAIN???!!!""

I shouted back, ""No, this was my first time!""

""Hey everyone, Ray\_RG here won the Elite Eagle again!"" SLD said to the whole class.

(Some random person) ""Wow, really? That's not fair!""

""This was my first time!!!"" I shouted, obviously telling the fucking truth and already snapped 'cause people agreed with him.

The whole class starts laughing and praising SLD for ""revealing my secret"" and providing the truth. I turned red, furious.

My teacher walks in and scolds the class for being so loud, and everyone died down. Now of course, at the time, my friends were idiotic, and thought it was right to laugh along and support SLD.

&#x200B;

That was the start of what he said to me to ruin my life.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to lunch this one time.

&#x200B;

People normally sit with me, as I have mild peanut allergies. And just so you know, I'm a boy. SLD had been bullying me for a long time now, and I was disgusted every time I saw his face.

He walked up to my tale with his best friend, who also loved to bully me as well. He very well knew that he had to stay away from me, as the teacher had told him to stay away from me, as well as the dumb principal.

He opened a container of pickles and shoved it into my face violently saying, ""You want some p*eeeeeeeeeeeeaaaannnnnnuuuuutttt*s Ray\_RG?""

I backed away and almost fell off my table. He shook the container so that some of the juices would fall on me, but not much. He pulled his container away and I started to get back into a straight-back position, as I was prone to having scoliosis. He did the same again, this time, the container bumped my nose a little bit. Nothing spilled but I was furious.

He then said the most cynical and cruel thing anyone could say to another person who could one day die from allergies, ""If you're alergic to nuts, why not get your's cut off?""

He laughed and got up to go away and have people praise him for bullying me.

I brought this up two days later to the principal, and I told her of EVERYONE who was at that table, they claimed to have not seen him there at all, and that he didn't approach me that day. They liked him, and they knew I knew, yet they kept defending the wrong person. I told the principal that I was perplexed, since everyone I amend was denying the situation.

She said back to me, ""Because it *didn't* happen?""

I told her, ""It DID happen.""

She dismissed me and SLD kept on doing it. No matter how many times SLD bullied me, the nun would send him off with a warning and a detention. And let me say this, at my school, 3 detentions results in a suspension; 3 suspensions would mean an expulsion. Never happened to that little b\*tch. It's because sadly, with a majority of nuns, many believe bully are good, they just choose not to. Boy are they all wrong. No-one will change once like this.

&#x200B;

He was told multiple times that he had to stay away from me, but he never listened. SLD always did what he could to get in my way of living my life the way I wanted to.

One time, me and my friend were playing a game we call, ""Pass"", where we would kick a ball back and forth to get exercise both cardiovascular, and with our legs as well. We were playing to the side of a soccer field since the sports boys in our grade were using a majority of the two files, both taken. We weren't interfering with there game what soever, and then SLD decided to bring the game OVER to US. He lead the group over to where we were playing, an then blamed us to being in the way.

&#x200B;

""Stop playing over here! We are playing soccer already, go the the other field and play your Soccer."" SLD said to us.

Then he grabbed our ball, kicked it, then my friend, being a legit speed demon, ran to catch it, if it went to the softball field, we were in trouble and couldn't get it back. He brought it back to me, then I held to to go somewhere else, since I lost my will to play. HE DID THE SAME F\*CKING THING AGAIN. I was pissed. I was going to kick the soccer ball he had, but I lost my temper after months of buildup, and I kicked his shin.

&#x200B;

After lunch, the sub-teacher came to be saying that I was bullying him and kicked his shin for the fun of it, and that he was seriously hurt and was limping in pain. I tried to tell her that HE was doing the bullying first, and that I tried to keep my temper under control. She believed him more than me. I was the one in trouble, and he had such a smug face on him.

&#x200B;

Similar thing happened while we played somewhere else, he and his friend took our ball and started playing with an entire group.

When we said it was our ball, he said, ""No, its *my* ball.""

When the group hear it, they agreed with him.

Then he said, ""If you want to take our ball so badly, here! have it!""

And he kicked it into the art class courtyard, and me and my friend were forced to take the blame since the innocent SLD was telling the divine truth.

&#x200B;

Fast foward to early on in fifth grade.

&#x200B;

I felt that this year would have been better, as he was in the other class. Boy was I wrong. He was moved over to my class. I told my teacher about his issues with bullying me, and she seemed like I was teaching her a new topic recently discovered. It was apparently like that since SLD had ABSOLUTELY F\*CKING NOTHING ON HIS RECORD.

&#x200B;

She still let him into our class, and he took every opportunity to bully me. My mom was there one time, and she saw him TRIP ME. she was furious. She knew this had been happening all this time, and was furious at what he did, yet the principal still believed ME to be the liar, as she was friends with SLD's family (I learned this a few years later).

&#x200B;

One day, he decided to bully another person, leaving a note in his desk saying ""You are gay."" That was the ""Final Straw"". I was furious when I hear that the principal had said that. The LAST STRAW? he did all this to ME and you did NOTHING to punish SLD. That F\*\*king nun only did something AFTER he did it to someone else.

&#x200B;

He was suspended, but my parents took an initiative a few days earlier before that incident. WWe had a meeting with the pastor of that school (since it was part of a church). They had him PERSONALLY ask the family to either: 1. stay away from our son forever: or 2, Leave the school. They took the second option.

But he stayed until the last day of school, which was our Christmas Program ( explain that later).

&#x200B;

THEN OUT OF ALL TIMES THE GRADE TOOK PITY ON ME

&#x200B;

They were shocked that he did all that to me. They thought he was an angel. He continued to bully me on my YouTube channel as well, and I finally managed to get him to leave me the FUCK alone, after he made multiple brand accounts to continue bullying me.

&#x200B;

I confirmed that everyone liked him at the Christmas Program, the final day I saw him (aside from the days he came to pick up his friends from school and tried confronting me, but I turned around and joined into a conversation with whomever I knew). We were singing ""12 days of Christmas"", and every time we would describe something like, ""2 Turtle Doves"", he would say, ""2 John Cenas"", and make everyone on stage laugh. And apparently he was accepted by multiple schools, and EVEN ALLOWED TO ADVANCE A GRADE (he was held back in kindergarten for maturity issues).

&#x200B;

The aftereffects are horrible. I have many emotional issues now. My temper is almost gone forever, I have adrenaline rushes every now and then, and I just don't trust anyone anymore, sometimes not even my friends. One of them swore to defend me, but did nothing to help me, only escalated the situation. I can't get along with anyone, and the slightest joke about me makes me snap, if it's intended to make me mad, since it reminds me of him so much. I'm also very much more antisocial than I used to be. I was depressed up to the day I wrote this, and I've hurt myself many times, physically and emotionally the most.

&#x200B;

Some idiot in my grade back in 7th kept saying, ""Oh, uhh SLD is going to be back!""

me: ""When? he's not here yet.""

Idiot classmate ""He'll back back in 8th grade.""

And he was right! That year, I found that he had advanced a grade, and was now heading to high school and the ONE SCHOOL I WANTED TO GO TO, so now I'm stuck with schools I don't want to go to. But it's either that, or I re-live 3 years of pure hell.

&#x200B;

One thing your should learn from this story is this: If you have a nun for a principal, don't go to that school.

Another is: If the bullied is favored, gather your friends to make evidence.

Last one is this: If you can, try to sneak in a small recording device, and attach it just behind your shirt. This will allow you to record ANYTHING ANYONE says to you, and gives you legitimate proof that you were the victim, not the bully like SLD.

&#x200B;

If YOU have the want to bully someone, don't do it. You will PAY for it in the future, no matter what time it is. Maybe the divine will punish you with poverty, loss of everything and everyone you love, or possibly worse.

Do the right thing, if you see your friend being bullied, stand up for them! Be the witness! You will be rewarded later in life, no matter when. You might survive a strong illness, become rich, or even become famous!

Don't back down from protecting a friend.

&#x200B;

And for the bullied, be strong, you can pull through anything. If all hope seems lost, consult someone you trust, unlike I did. And look what happened to me since I didn't, I have all these issues now. I hurt myself because of what he did to me. Don't make the mistake me and my friends made, make the right choice, same thing goes for the bully.

&#x200B;

And to be honest, I really believe we have guardian angels. I once tried to cut myself, and something grabbed my arm. I was the only one there, and I slowly felt calmer, and put the knife back where I got it. I realized what I was about to do, and I saw how wrong it was. I believe it was a guardian angel telling me that what I was doing was wrong, and they were right.

&#x200B;

Death is never an option, for the bully, not even they deserve it, no matter the circumstances. No even you deserve it. If you want to die, consult someone, meet up and talk about what you have been feeling. Let your emotions out, but never direct them at someone. It will relive any stress you may have. There will always be someone with an open hand for you.

Very few people had an open hand to understand my agony, but I survived. I'm alive and getting better, and I believe you can too. Never give up, anyone can survive."
572,Untouchable Bullies,6,audnxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/audnxi/untouchable_bullies/,2,1551077270.0,"From the start of secondary to the end I was bullied... 5 long years of hell in total and it's not your conventional bullying that eventually goes away. It was Non-stop. 

Let's add a little context...

I'm the different kid. I never had ask.fm, Snapchat, Instagram, BBM or the latest iPhone/blackberry or anything like that. Not because i couldn't have them I had a phone that functioned like a phone that's all I needed at 12-13 and I  didn't want the other stuff as I never saw the point of seeking justification for your existence from others. I mean I've only got Instagram and Snapchat in the last few years (18 now was probably late 15- early 16 when I finally decided to get it cus I was curious what all the fuss was about) Anyway beacuse of my lack of (anti) social media connection I was never in anyone's group or known for my follower count etc. I just kept Myself to myself which for some reason made me a target as being different in my school wasn't accepted. I had/have a dark sense of humour I didn't like what was 'popular' and I was surprisingly political for my age (the political part will be important later).

With that our of the way, back to the story...

I was repeatedly singled out for all of this and at first it never got to me I had been bullied in the past and walking away worked and people got bored and although they lasted longer now they still eventually walked away in Bordem, because of this I always kept myself to myself which still wasn't acceptable. This was when the untouchables started to make themselves known. One day keeping myself to myself playing 8bit COD on my phone one lad who was a common harraser walked up to me and grabbed my phone and tried to run. I never was one to retaliate but at this point in time I was going through some dark times I'd just lost a few family members in series over a few week period so instead of attracting the attention of a teacher and getting my phone back calmy. I jumped on the prick and took him down😂 I grabbed my phone walked away and so did he. While on my lunch again playing 8 bit COD, 3 lads including the prick from earlier surrounded me where I was sitting and just looked at me before the prick (which he shall now be known as) slapped me (he was a bitch like that he never punched always slapped 😂) anyway I footplanted him in the shin causing him to jerk then the two other lads grabbed me, threw me off my seat and then spent about 2-3 minutes kicking the shit out of me until a teacher saw what was happening and ended it picked me up and asked me what happened why I was on the floor etc. And I calmly explained as I usually do which tended to get the teacher on my side that prick slapped me and then then pricks friends threw me off my chair and proceeded to kick the shit out of me. The response I received was ""prick wouldn't do that"" and that was it everyone walked away and I was left like what the actual fuck just happened. Anyway they realised nothing was done and repeated with 'jumping' me repeatedly over the next school year until some new teacher who didn't even ask what happened and just saw them kicking me and went apeshit sideways at them and put them all in hour long detentions which was deemed a 'serious' punishment in school. Anyway they let off after that and I went back to keeping myself to myself until the start of year 9, specifically injection day.

More context...

There were a small group of lads who deemed themselves 'hard' as they'd been gym once and posed giving the finger and such and we're just general dickheads to everyone they didn't like. 

So around comes injection day and everyone is just sitting there waiting as you do but this group of 'hard' lads are shitting themselves shivering and crying as they don't like injections and I notice that and take note. So a few weeks later they're back to their antics being dickheads and make their way to me. I use my wildcard and call them out for acting hard yet crying on injection day which went down a storm and everyone starts laughing and they dispurse in shame. But they didn't come back and kick the shit out of me (they did that later on) they did something much worse...they scoured my Facebook profile noticed I had taken a particular interest in Ukip the right wing part and without looking into any party policies they and the other popular kids and 'hard' men start a rumour: I'm a right wing extremist who wants all people who aren't 100% British (aka not white, their words not mine they eventually changed to that later on though) deported to their country of origin. When I first heard about this was like ""what?😂 Who's gonna believe that?😂""

I think you can guess what happened next...

Everyone, in my year, in the year above and below and even some people outside of my school believed it.

Over the next 3 years they used this as a shield and reason to beat me up until I eventually had a near mental breakdown took it to the highest deputy head teacher who was new and had a 0 tolerance on bullying (which was BS) 

More context

All these dickheads who initially started the rumour were part of one school sport team or another and by this point for some reason all the PE teachers were made into lower deputy heads. It'll make sense in a minute.

So I actually built a pretty solid case with photos of  their threats through Facebook and videos of them confronting me amongst large groups and loudly asking why I want them and their family deported. The guy was in awe and then went about apprehending all the dickheads and pricks and showed them everything so they couldn't deny it and they were on the verge of being expelled and excluded depending on their parts in the rumour... But then when I was finally starting to get some closure all the lower deputy head PE teachers came together and protested the exclusion of these pupils as the schools amazing football and basketball teams would suffer without them...

IT ONLY WENT AND FUCKING WORKED...They all got off Scot free and although they rarely bothered me after this the rumour had been spread to wide to stop and even after I left school and went to college it followed me it had spread that far... But that is a story for another time...this rumour drove me to and over the edge and fucked me up mentally I'm depressed and mentally unstable now cus of it and that's not self diagnosis I went to the doctors and got that shit... I have some closure as it turns out their sport skill couldn't help them in their A levels and they all got dropped pre exams so wasted a year and a bit of their lives which while I got an apprenticeship and got my diplomas. I see that as a win. Although it took two years I think that's all I'm getting now and if they read this at any point I just wanna say...

How's life ? Cunts."

Everything started when I started going to school. For the entire time I was in Elementary school I was picked on and harassed by a pack of kids. At one point I gained enough confidence to tell my crush my feelings for her, and she lead me to a secluded area where she and her friend could laugh at me. I didn’t have friends, I only drifted from group to group, always an outsider and always an outcast. Middle school rolls around and I’ve gotten myself in a small friend group of misfits and losers, where I felt right at home. Of course we were bullied but they seemed to enjoy picking on me and my friend (call him josh). Me and Josh became inseparable during this time and I truly thought that I had a friend for life. Then the summer after 7th grade came. I switched schools, but still hung out around my old school. It was here that I was intercepted, beaten, cut, and emotionally destroyed. They hit my head so hard that I truly believe that them hitting me caused my memory problems, which plague me to this day. Not long after that my old group of friends stopped talking to me. They completely shut me out, even Josh, who I lived very close to (less than a block away) never spoke to me ever again. I am now in my junior year of high school, where I have only been bullied slightly during my time there.

But I'm not talking about school bullying.
I want to talk about a particular person I had to deal with after school. The most vile girl to have ever lived.

If I had to go into the details of everything she did, I would end up writing an entire novel. But basically she made me out to be the ugliest monster she had ever seen.

She laughed at me, insulted me, belittled and humiliated me, threw evil looks on the daily, refused to sit by me, punched me in the back, slammed the door in my face, refused to help me, and also french kissed her boyfriend right in front of me while giving me smug looks while I had no choice but to watch. She also admitted in front of the class that she hated me, and I never even said a single word to her.

All because I'm ugly.

It's been 5 years and it still hurts.
I know I'm not THAT ugly, not anymore anyway. I have people who think I'm beautiful.

But at this point I am more hurt she got away with it. I accept she thought I was ugly because we both have very different beauty ideals.
I'm more upset she was a hypocrite and got away with it just because she was pretty and neurotypical.

I still cry about it. I have a sinking feeling in my chest and my stomach turns. I hate her more than anything. I have had a fiery passionate hatred for her since the day we met. She is so evil.

I don't know what to do. People tell me she was jealous. I can guarantee she was NOT. I don't know why she hated me so much that she wanted to ruin my life like this. I can't function.

I feel like it was my fault and I should have looked different so it wouldn't have happened."

I decided to share my problem with you about my office environment where I spend most of the time. I work in a company's main office where there are 10 people. When I started working here (almost a year ago) everything was fine, people  seemed to care for each other, respect, have good sense of humor etc. I felt like it was a real family. I was helping everybody, used to be nice and understanding as well as hardworking. Sadly everything changed recently - the woman sharing my room bullies me a lot. I am talking about verbal bullying. Her insulting phrases have been ignored by me for a while, but now I don't think that I should just keep silent because they are getting worse. The problem is that the woman mentioned above is sort of ""leader"" of other women here, who try to satisfy her and her ego as often as possible. So now I face the reality: my office consists of ones who bully and rest of us who are getting bullied. There are other colleagues who don't like me because of some unknown reasons too. I carry on working and do my job, but I feel that at the end of the day I am stressed out, unhappy and demotivated.

I don't want just to leave and escape as I might face the same problem anywhere so I'd prefer to grow myself up and get a good lesson about dealing with such people.

Any advice will be much appreciated.

Thanks :)"

&#x200B;

Being bullied, even just for the short amount of two weeks was extremely hurtful. It plagues me everyday still and I find I have no one to open up about my trauma. It started when I broke up with my ex boyfriend, I only asked him ""Would you still love me if I indentified as a guy?"" Apparently rather than tell me he was hurt and offended, he tells his older friend who tells me to apologize for that. I'm not unreasonable, so of course I apologize. Keep that in mind as we delve deeper into this. 

Next fucking week so many people call me trans, ask if I'm trans, directly tell me I'm just trans. I remember there was this guy who asked if I was trans and after I clearly told him I wasn't, he told me ""Yes you are."" Then he says ""I knew you were trans"" and again after saying I'm not, he says ""Yes you are."" Ever been denied of your indentity? Ever been told you weren't who you said you were? It hurt more than anything to feel invalid and that you were nothing more than the lies people had said.

Here's something fucking hilarious, I was so fed up and scarred. So I wanted an apology from my ex, he complies, but at least 30 minutes later I get a text from his older friend calling me a liar. Why? For wanting a fucking apology, she says I'm a liar for feeling hurt and wanting an apology for that. She tells to me apologize too, even though I already did. The day of the apology, he was so insincere and funny thing; after I said ""bye thot"" to my ex. I get told in science to ""not be a jerk like that"" and after all I've been through, I wanted to end my life more than anything.

His feelings may have been hurt, but at least I didn't spread a rumor about him."
585,8 year old bullying my son,7,9trjmh,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9trjmh/8_year_old_bullying_my_son/,6,1541249976.0,"My son is 8 years old and in 3rd grade. About a month ago there was a misunderstanding between my son and this other kid. My son didn't understand this kid was being sarcastic and he got really upset and overreacted a bit.

I think this put a target on my sons back, because soon after, this kid I'll call John began messing with him. My son is friends with 3-4 other boys in the class. He's known these other boys since kindergarten. This is the first year he has John in his class. He never knew him until this year.

So anyway, John is manipulative, extroverted, confident and athletic. He has slowly manipulated all my sons friends to stop playing with him. If my son and one of his friends are hanging around at recess, John will approach them, tell my son, ""You're so annoying."" ask the friend, ""Why are you hanging out with such an annoying person. C'mon come play with me."" Then he'll grab him by the arm and pull him away.

This boy is a bit intimidating and these other boys aren't savvy enough to make a stand. On the days that John is absent, all my son's friends play with him, but as soon as John is around, they go with him when he drags them away. So that shows me the other boys are afraid of John and does what he says so they won't get harassed like my son is.

He comes home crying. He's never had anyone treat him like this before. At first he kept trying to be nice to John because he wanted to be his friend, but John would reply rudely anytime my son tried to talk to him. He would say, ""I don't care."" or ""No one cares"".  Or he'll look through him, playing like my son is invisible and acts like he can't hear, but as soon as my son gives up trying to talk to him and walks away, John will start laughing.

Anyway, I've let their teacher know about this, but she never sees it because John is slick enough to only do it at lunch or recess or when the teacher is out of the classroom. She has taken John  aside and had a talk with him about the way he's acting and he said he'd stop doing it.

That lasted for a day. My son would tell his teacher when John did something, but he feels like she wasn't doing much to stop it. So at this point his teacher is oblivious to what's going on. Never asks me or my son if everything's ok. So we kind of gave up on her.

 I thought things had finally stopped recently, because every time I'd ask him how school went, he'd say it was good. But my son broke down crying the other day and told me his behavior hasn't stopped at all. He's just tired of telling me about it. I told him he MUST tell me every time John does something mean, so I can help him.

So I went to see the principal. Told her everything. She said she was going to call for John to come to her office so she can talk to him. My son wasn't convinced that getting a lecture from the principal was going to fix it, because he can tell that John just doesn't care. His principal assured him she knows how to talk to him in a way where he will stop.

He stopped for a day. He treated my son  respectfully throughout that day and didn't react  when my son hung out with one of the friends John usually tries to drag away. The next day he was back to his mean self. 

I went to the school and the principal had already left for the day, so I sent her an email detailing all the abuse my son received that day.

Now it's Friday and I will go in to see the principal on Monday hoping, but not expecting she has a Plan B for dealing with bullies. I hear all this zero tolerance about bullying and the kids had a pep rally a couple years ago about No Bullying! and they all got a t-shirt. That's great and all, but what actions are shown to be effective in dealing with 8 year old bullies?

I would expect they would notify his parents and if that doesn't help, I will demand that John be moved into another class. I'm just not feeling assured that the school will do much, but I'm ready to raise hell within the whole school district if I have to."

Then a few bullies, all from my school, came. A girl told a boy he should go sit next to me and pointed at me, (so sick, she pointed at me so self-evident like I was some kind of doll she wanted to chose to torture) so he did. And severe others were watching in a semicircle around me. I didn‘t even realize what‘s going on and what I did to them. 
They whispered to one another because they already knew what their sick plan was. Maybe 5-7 people. 
They looked at me just like their favourite show is gonna start.

He slowly sat next to me and everybody got quiet. 
He was big with big build and blonde. 
He started to touch my legs up and down, and got too near to me. 
Now the bully viewers started giggling and staring. 
The girl, which had the idea, stared at me the most and seemed like she was in some weird tense. 
She had semi short brown straight hair. Not a girl you would suspect it from.

The assaulter seemed heated by the giggling of his group and lost more and more inhibition.
He even tried to jokingly kiss me. 
The viewers, disturbingly even GIRLS, enjoyed my assault and made fun of the situation. They seemed to enjoy to humilate one lonely girl in one big bully group. 

Yes, you read it right: He touched my body against my will and girls and boys giggled and gave me satisfied looks. This hell was real.

Then two others who weren‘t bullies saw it and took me away, quietly, without confronting the sick group, without looking back. They just took my hand and took me physically away. They bully group said nothing, like the semi quiet psychos they were, and looked confused how I just went away. 

I said thank you, my angels, good timing, and went home. 

I felt so sickened and humilated. Like my sexuality was just a joke, like I was just a joke, like it was a joke to touch me, and bullied for nothing. 

What did a human being do to be treated like this for no reason. Demons are real and they are sometimes in people.

587,My first time expressing my experience of school bullying (warning: essay),8,9pl8b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9pl8b7/my_first_time_expressing_my_experience_of_school/,2,1539994077.0,"As a first-time poster on this sub-reddit it's difficult to know where to start or what to include. So this will likely just read as a stream of consciousness and lack proper structure or focus at times, I thank you for bearing with me on this.

My reason for posting this is I'm just aching to express my feelings on this issue as I wouldn't want to burden the people i'm closest to with this lengthy and emotional ramble. It just seems appropriate, at least at the time of writing this. 

I don't want to come across as victimising myself either and I'm fully aware this is all from my singular perspective. But I will attempt to be as balanced as possible when expressing myself here while not feeling like i'm holding back either.

With that preamble out of the way, I'll make a start. Education for me has been very harsh indeed. It started in nursery and lasted right the way up to the beginning of university, so it's roughly a 15 year period of relentless mockery and occasional violence from my peers, naturally I won't be able to sum up 15 years on a reddit post so I'll aim express what I can.

The thing that hurts most about bullying (to me anyway) is not necessarily what they did to me but the fact that they WANTED to treat me that way. I was brought up to be moral, kind, to share things, to work hard etc. It goes without saying that these aren't the most popular traits to have at school and so I found I would be singled out very early on in whatever educational institution I was in.

But it would always be on my mind ""why are they doing this to me?... Why are they actively going out of their way to hurt me when I've done them no wrong and don't even know half of them!"". Often rumours would get spread about me whenever i'd move up to the next stage in education. The popular kids who didn't like me would invent stories and paint me as some kind of monster to their new peers, ensuring that everyone's view of me was coloured before they'd met me. I could see this cycle play out time and time again, but could do nothing to break it. These rumours would allow my abusers to feel endlessly justified in treating me the way they did because in their eyes, I was the monster, blissfully unaware the only monstrous behaviour being engaged in was by them.

I'd tell the teacher on the bullies, I'd make sure to never hit back (because self-defense is discouraged by schools for some fucked up reason), I'd make sure to avoid the areas of the schools where my tormentors would linger, but alas nothing was solved to a satisfactory degree. 

In hindsight, hitting them back would have been the best solution for me at that time but I was too scared of the consequences, that it could cost me my future somehow (be it getting into trouble or getting a serious injury). I'm not happy that I believe returning the violence would have benefited me but I'm sorry, after 15 years of doing EXACTLY what the authority figures at schools said in terms of managing the problem solved NOTHING, and in many cases would make it worse.

Perhaps one of the most bewildering experiences I had was during P.E. We were all lined up doing this improvised assault course around the sports hall and one of the other kids (who i barely knew) ordered me to go next. I VERY gently and politely said that it was his turn and I didn't want to cut in front of him like that. What did I get for that? A great big punch right in my temple, somehow an entire room of people didn't see it, go figure.

The day didn't end there sadly, in the changing rooms the same boy proceeded to sneak up on me whilst i changed and emptied his water all over me, no such luck as for it to occur out of view, everyone saw and fell silent. Then the usual taunts and laughter followed after he crushed the bottle against the back of my head and strolled off. I was just frozen at that point, internally feeling like a nuclear explosion had gone off but was somehow frozen in time or surpressed somehow, because even amidst all of that I couldn't muster up a reaction.

And that reality stings too... ""ignore them"" was the main advice I received. Even though what teachers perceived as ""ignoring"", the bullies saw as ""zero consequences"". But for some reason I remained determined to obey the advice given to me by the teachers, I guess since they were such a far-cry from my abusers I felt some kind of faith in them.

I shan't linger much longer on that day, but he wasn't done yet! Somehow during the lunch break we pass in the corridor and i swiftly found myself grabbed by the collar and whacked across the face again. I honestly don't remember much of that day beyond that which is unusual for me.

When I was 14 and just about holding my mind together I clicked really well with a girl who was volunteering at the school library, since that was the safe haven for my friends and I, we found a lot of time to get to know each other. I really liked her, and after months of the usual awkward teenage interactions we actually went out! Yes! I'd done it! I'd found someone I cared about and who cared for me and I'd finally get something that resembles a normal school-life!... 6 days it lasted. because on Day 6 she'd heard a rumour going around. A rumour that I was apparently saying to people around school that she'd been sexual with me. I said nothing of the sort and even aimed to hide the fact I was seeing someone precisely so they couldn't ruin it for me. But all eyes were set squarely on me and they found out somehow. So instead of just leaving me be they collectively decided ""NO! You don't get to be happy with someone, you don't get relief from this torture, we WILL take it away from you"". She didn't want to hear my side of the story and just accepted the rumour without a second thought.

I know they say ""kids are cruel"" to just brush off the nasty, venomous behaviour they're capable of. But to interfere with a relationship out of no other motive than spite, or the joy in tormenting me is something else in my opinion. I wouldn't dream of inflicting it on anyone as an adult and I had no desire to do such a thing as a kid either. I think that was the day I realised that the chance of receiving any kind empathy from these people was zero.

So here I sit, fairly shaken from vividly recounting those experiences and feeling the burden that my school life has given me and the impact it has on me currently. 

I have progressed leaps and bounds in terms of my mental health and am in a relationship with the girl I may marry one day. But that being said I'm still not at the point where I'm dealing with my past healthily. I'm hoping this expression might be the first step towards fixing that.

If you read all of that, then thank you for taking the time to do so, it is greatly appreciated. And any thoughts or opinions on the above would be massively appreciated too.

Thanks

The guy has methed out teeth and listens to fucking Joe Rogan, is overweight, etc.

I picked up this job because I needed to move out of the area. It was going good until everyone started being really petty and cutting me down about the way I dress or do things. It's an easy fucking job and doesn't take a genius. I guess what gets to me is that everyone is nice to me around the boss, but otherwise hates me, and I'm about to rage on someone and physically hurt them like I had to in high school.

I don't belong here. This is the sixth or seventh job I've held where I've been picked on by people. Idk if it's just a southern thing as I live in Tennessee and have a college degree.

And it's happening in my public circle too. Women are getting drunk in front of me and being really aggressive and as I understand, every one of the people bullying me is a fuck up in their own lives in one way or another. Either they get picked on at work or have a fucked up relationship with their family. I have fucked up circumstances too, but I try not to take it out on people.

I'm starting to just accept that this is how people are. People will naturally push people around that are more attractive or smarter than they are due to their own insecurities, and to that effect, humanity is a fucked up little place to exist in."

Until yesterday.

I went with a friend to the beach where she met up with olher friends. One of them immediately seemed to hate me or something, I didn't get up from my towel when I wanted to shake her hand also made a joke about her ex (not knowing it was her ex and the excact situation, sometimes I just say shit without thinking). I guess that is why she hates me after knowing me for +/- 5 min.

Later I was sitting with a guy, who I also didn't know, talking about what my type was and other slightly sexual stuff. She jumped in with some weirdly nasty remarks about me being a slut and asking inappropriate questions about my sexual past, some of the group went with her in the kinda weird accusations. It started with the one guy as a sort of jokingly teasing, she was just plain mean.

I'm a pretty strong person so I asked her if she liked me or something, wanting to know so much about my sex life. She did not appreciate that.  Said she would beat the shit out of me for saying that. Also fun, saying to my friend ""don't ever do this to me again"", ya know taking me with her, with me standing next to them... 

Later when I'm alone with my friend she says that is just how she is and I should forget about it.... Actually getting angry with me for having problems with it! Yeah. She is just a fucking bully and the rest of the world should accept that.

It happened yesterday but I just feel really shitty about it, especially my friends reaction. 

I honestly don't understand this. I'm a fairly likeable and open person. Why would someone treat someone like this if you don't even know them?  I just feel really bad about this.

It's been 12 years since I want to school, and I still catch myself thinking about those comments every now and then. Does anyone else have comments like that?

The ones that pops up for me particularly often are, amongst others:

Someone stole my English essay, when I was around 12, English is my second language and we were supposed to write an introduction of ourselves to our new teacher. I had started off with ""My name is *name* and I go to *name of school*"", and a boy took it from my desk, started reading it out loud, and laughed at me, saying ""Go to *the school*, you take the bus, you don't walk here!"" He meant go as in the literal sense, and even though my sentence was correct, and the bully was wrong, it was just the effect it made. Everyone laughed of course, and after that I was constantly teased for my bad English, for years after that. I still recall that situation every time I write anything with ""go"", it's become more of a nuisance now though. 

Also, another time, when I was around 15-16, I was walking to the cafeteria when a few girls started giggling at me, pointed at me, and one of them asked me in a fake, sweet voice, ""Do you even know what an orgasm is?"" I said ""Yes"" because I did know, and I didn't want to say no, even if I'd rather just avoid the subject all together, and she then asked me to ""Explain it!"", by then, I just walked away, but the fact that they were obviously talking and laughing at me before I even walked by, and her way of embarrassing me, really stuck. 

It's strange how some, no matter how insignificant, things stick with you. I had way wore experience with my bullies but these comments are the ones that pops into my head more often than others. "

598,My Advice to you all,7,7y4vwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/7y4vwm/my_advice_to_you_all/,1,1518874980.0,"Hello all,

I am someone who is a former victim of bullying. I'm not subscribed to this sub and am not sure what made me look this up. 

But as a brief run down, I am a male that was bullied throughout late middle school and on and off throughout high school. There were several occassions that my bullying was physical, but for the most part it was verbal/emotional. Right now I am in my mid 20's. Don't really feel like saying much more than that. But look at what I am about to write as a letter from your future self trying to save you from more pain. 

My first piece of advice is if you are in a bullying situation right now, aim to resolve it as soon as possible. Do not let it drag on. The longer you let it go on unopposed, the harder it is to stop and the greater the negative consequences. Bullying is like a poison. I once thought that when I graduated high school and no longer had to see my tormentors faces anymore, that that would be the end of it. And while I am no longer being bullied, the bullying I received had left deep psychological scars that I didn't fully realize at the time, and are very difficult to heal from. 

While I have healed to an extant, I still find it difficult to trust people and also have difficulty when it comes to making friends. Predictably, this has led to loneliness, severe depression and a host of other problems. Trust me you do not want to experience these things. Save yourself!

The second piece of advice is to not use violence as the ""first"" solution. First, try to reason with your bullies if you can. Ask them why they do these things to you. Try to get them to think. And tell them you do not like that. Most of the time, I realize this does not work. But I did this once and it was interesting to see one of my bullies actually seriously think upon this question and genuinely tell me he didn't know why. 

The second piece of advice is to DOCUMENT ALL BULLYING interactions. Think of it like writing a journal entry. For instance if something happened at school that day. When you get home, open up a journal, write down the day, the time and what was said/what went down in as much detail as possible. You may not appreciate this now if your young, but keeping a record is extremely important. Do not take this for granted. 

Third action is to tell trustworthy adults. This includes your parents and teachers/school administrators. Be persistent with this and try to get them to take action. Make sure to document these in your journal as well. What you tell the adminstrator, what they say back to you, date, time, etc (Do not underestimate how important this is, trust me).  Think of these people as a double edged sword. As a weapon of sorts. The fact is, most schools these days don't give a shit about bullying. And the one's that claim they do only say so to cover their asses in courts as protection against lawsuits (hence zero tolerance). Sometimes these people are useful in your fight against bullies. Keeping a journal will save your ass in case things go sour. Don't be so naive to think that the school won't be evil enough to call you a bully/instigator. It happens.

Fourth. Don't be afraid to use violence as a last resort. But only as a last resort. And within reason. And if you fight, please use your fists, not a weapon. Don't give memer's more inspiration for school shooter memes. And remember, when you fight, the goal isn't too win (I realize this may sound counter intuitive but trust me). If you win the fight, then congratulations. But your goal in fighting is to give your bully as much physical pain as possible so they will think twice before messing with you again. Do not underestimate the power of pain. Punch hard and fast. This is one thing I deeply regret not doing (more of). 

As for consequences. You have to weigh them. There are some schools with expulsion policies, and that makes the situation a little more complicated. But trust me, if the worst you have to fear is a temporary suspension, that is a better fate/tradeoff than to live for years with psychological trauma that will eat away at you. And you have it whether you realize it or not. The sooner you end the bullying, the less trauma you will have, the less psychological consequences later in life. 

I'm too tired to write anymore, but if you have any questions or concerns feel free to ask or private message me. "
599,Never give in.,6,687p7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/687p7r/never_give_in/,2,1493471164.0,"I am (emotionally) one of the most resilient MF's I know, but I have to say - at 27 years old - I'm confident I'll never be able to move past (much of) the experience of having been bullied (at school, at home, in competitive sports). So much anger, hatred and thirst for justice (or maybe it's revenge); it's human nature to feel this way. Rather than take it out on others though, I took it out on myself, because to exact pain on those who've inflicted it upon me would have been equally unjust to have been a part of (or so I thought, at the time); how can you ever treat someone in such a way, when you yourself know the pain and suffering that that can cause (i.e. if you know how it feels, how could you ever do that to someone else?)

Violence is wrong, and only begets more violence, but the only thing that hurts more than the bullying itself is the shame of never having stood up for yourself. Not because you didn't want to, but because you couldn't muster the courage. This - and the loss of self-respect that comes with it - are above all, the things that I can't move past,  cannot forgive myself for (though I have tried, and to some extent, made progress). 

Confidence is as much a skill as it is a tool; you have to be shown what it is and how to use it. But what if you hadn't? What if it was hidden, or taken from you - say, by an uneducated father with low self-esteem who used fear to stomp out (even healthy) dissent. As a child (already vulnerable), you're an open target without the means to defend yourself. Why is it so hard to have respect for fellow human beings (regardless of your relationship or age difference); how is it not easier to fill people with strength, confidence and courage, rather than beat them into submission, make them feel inferior and hopeless, opening them up to experiences that leave them with incurable scars and long-lasting consequences? 

I won't write a novel. I've shared this with psychiatrists and close confidants, but even in those moments, I can never slow down long enough to find the right words. The mention of those experiences instantly trigger trauma and rage. I'm not writing this for you...I'm writing this for me; I've become increasingly closed off - beyond the prison I've come to house myself in made of my own thoughts - but if someone you know is on the other side (the trigger) of this bullet called bullying, maybe you'll snap some sense into them, and share how much easier it would have been for their victims to actually have been hit by a real one; that's the pain they cause. While they laugh it off an move on, some people live it for a lifetime. 

To all the survivors out there, finding the strength to wake up every morning and stand tall in the face of your oppressors (whether they're real, or the tormented thoughts in your head), I want you to know you're not alone. There are others like you. Everywhere. I want you to know that we love you, and I'd hug each and every one of you if I had the chance, but what's even more important, is that we find each other, stick together, and support each other, because it is we - who've lived and internalized these experiences - know what we're going through and know what we need best. We are our own best advocates.

And for those of you who are still young, or experiencing this evil for the first time: be strong, be courageous, use your voice, stand up against injustice and stand up for yourself. It may be the last thing you have the courage to do, but if you find yourself in a situation you think you can't get out of: ask for help (it doesn't mean you're weak); sometimes others have more knowledge and experience to deal with a problem that we haven't yet developed ourselves. Find ways to confront those who torment you, but never become one of them, and always remember two things: 1) how those assholes made you feel (so that you never become one), 2) how much fucking strength it takes to hold your head high, take hits like that and keep going (or, likewise, how easy it is to treat someone like shit, and how weak it makes that person).


In the words of Winston Churchill:

**""Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy""**

The you you have yet to become will thank you for it. "

All it took was three years of phone calls, meetings, letter after letter, self-doubt, escalation, wondering if I was going crazy, more escalation, wondering if they were already crazy, stress, stress, and more stress...and it's worth every moment.

I stayed true to my values and stood my ground as my son's advocate until I got an adequate, reasoned, adult response. I've shown my son that it's okay to stand up to authority when they're wrong. And I've made his world that little bit safer for him.

What broke the logjam was that the principal, who along with her assistant is solidly in denial about bullying, brought in her predecessor to consult on the matter. Wham bam, problem solved.

I've spent the past three years giving the principal and her assistant as much benefit of the doubt as I can, until I finally became convinced this year that there was no more doubt I could reasonably give them - they were the problem. This result confirms that. Bring in a new person, bust the logjam.

I would like to thank the school's restorative practice consultant, who tried to discourage me from escalating this matter; and my son's schoolmate's mother who said she thought stuff like this shouldn't be talked about. Guys, your misguided comments helped confirm me in my course.

If you're suffering bullying, and you're wondering whether it's worth all the stress to fight it and stay the course, let me tell you: it's worth it.

Parents, you are your child's advocate. It's your job to believe them and go into bat for them, time after time. Stand your ground.

**TL;DR** Three years of continual advocacy on my son's behalf finally brought an acknowledgement that he has been bullied, along with a suspension for the latest bully. "

This is a confession and a question to you all. 

I was bullied a very long time ago when I was boarding at school. I'll not make this soppy or overly dramtic. I'm not looking for sympathy. Regardless, being friendless through the majority of primary and high school, the ridicule, the pathetic ""jokes"" played on (Eg: Having the bottom of your toothpaste and flushed it down the toilet, no toothpaste for weeks on end, having to beg borrow and steal and if you told the Matron, I was a liar for not bringing from home.) being betrayed by people who felt pity and tried to help but would feed you to the Lions in a group situation. All of this lead by one asshole let's call him *Kingpin*. Kingpin eradicated my self esteem, forged me into a misanthropist and made me despise physical contact, so I find it difficult to keep a relationship because of distrust and my aversion to being touched. It's affected the majority of life. But during all of this I'd promised myself I would never be him. So in my whole life, I have only have smashed one guy in the face, but that was pre-high school.


I was never as strong as him. I never had the backup he did. Nobody to lie and vouch for me. I coped by finding shelter in the Computer room, but it was borrowed time. He would always find me. Same thing when we went home. We lived in a small town, with one park and a river where most kids would meet. I'd stay in doors all day. I knew as soon as I set food outside, it was his territory. Him and his friends would find me, and I would be drying my clothes and cleaning mud from my shoes for the rest of the day. 


I found myself a par-time, barely minimum wage job in the next town, where I would have to walk about 2 hours to get there, 9AM-5PM on holidays. No fun. No release. Working in retail as a teenager. *Retail*. I seem to be an asshole magnet. But eventually, I asked to move to the back and developed a passion for I.T because I always tried to load games on to the PC's and it would never work. So I did everything I could to make it work. 


My Dad was a traveling businessmen, if I tried to speak to him about it, I'd get the generic: ""Man up son, maybe you need to play more sports!"". We didn't have a psychologist in our little town, let alone a school Councillor. I opened up to my Mom a couple of times. She called me a drama queen. I'll never forget that day. I tried again and again. Her standard reply: ""Go take up Drama."" They never understood the gravity of the situation no matter how times I tried to explain.

*But I never forgave Kingpin. I never will.*

I moved away in my final two years of school, to a different place, but I found it hard to make friends there too. I managed to, with guys and girls a bit older then myself (2-5 years usually). Post-Matriculants and one or two current. (At the time). My mothers friend's son died and I joined my Mom at the funeral in our home town, Kingpin was there. It had been about 5-6 years since we had last had the pleasure of seeing each other. He greeted me heartily, like an old friend. I just smiled, greeted him and walked away.

**A friend.**

He took all the chances I had of making friends. He destroyed all the friendships I almost made. Him and his cronies took the best years of my life away. He took my Home Town from me and defiled my memories of the place. I can never go back. Every tree, stone and public amenity serves as a painful reminder of the past. 

**Fuck you**. *I'm not your friend*. I will ***never*** be.


He could count whatever he believed in that it was a funeral. If I ever see that prick again, I am will beat him within an inch of his life. For a microsecond, I want him to feel helpless. Alone. In so much pain your brain cannot process anything else. I want him to become *me*, all those years ago. 


Afterwards I found out his Dad is a recovering alcoholic and used to beat him and his Mom. I smiled the entire day that day. I know what you are thinking,""2Edgy4me"", but that was the only justice I never knew. 



Since that day, I've tried to make peace with everything that happened all those days ago. I felt ashamed of myself for being happy at the fact he had an unstable home. But I can't. I tried to convince myself: ""The poor guy, he had an abusive Dad and it was his only release!"". 

It gave him **NO** right to do what he did.


Some days, I don't feel this way. My life has moved on, I'm in a new chapter. But to me the damage is done. What he has done, is now cast in stone and I can't change that. But I have some days (Like today), where I wish to exert soul crushing pain on him. 


So I pose the question to you Reddit, how did you forgive your bully? How do I forgive my bully?...


I saw him comment on a mutual friends status today. He has a wide grin and his beautiful girlfriend is kissing his cheek. It's now branded into my thoughts. He seems to be doing well.  **Sigh**. This is what drove me to finally post this."

Although I'm an adult now and the bullying was done over a decade ago, should I be still upset about the trauma caused to me? The trauma caused to my sister and the pain I felt watching people torment my sister. The more I think about it, the more I realize... I have no memories with my classmates. What am I gonna talk about with them? ""oh, remember that time when one of you splashed pepper water in my sister's eyes, haha it was so funny when she couldn't see out of her eye for three days""

I have nothing to talk about with them, even if I tried to force out something positive.. There is nothing.

And the most upsetting thing is, one of the biggest bullies in our class was the one that added me and he acts like nothing ever happened. He talks about fond memories while he mentions my name. It made me think.. Am I senile? What fondness could this person remember between us, when there was one?

They are all acting happy and giddy.. Excited to see each other and I'm between agreeing to go or simply declining.

They might say ""oh, we were kids, now we are all adults so it's all forgotten""
But for five years after graduation I had severe anxiety. I couldn't walk around in my neighborhood even in my early adulthood because I was afraid of bumping into someone from my school or worse yet, my class. There were certain words that's would trigger my severe anxiety out of nowhere.

So to be honest, although we are adults and some things maybe best forgotten and although I have defeated my anxiety and fear related to that class, I don't know if I really want to go, simply because I have nothing but bad memories with that class."

I still have a lot of recovery to go but I recently realised that I have recovered quite a bit.

In 2018 Twenty One Pilots released a song called Jumpsuit which included the lyrics ""you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air"", they also made a music video for a song called Levitate which included footage of the singer being grabbed by the neck and pulled backwards.

Anyway I found these really triggering and didn't like listening to them or watching the music video obviously. So some kind stranger on reddit edited jumpsuit and removed the parts about throats (obviously it's not quite as good as the original but I could listen to it without worrying and it was so kind of them! It means so much to me still). I can now listen to the normal version of the song perfectly fine.

I watched the levitate music video recently and at first I forgot about the one part and it left me taken aback for a while but then when I could mentally prepare myself for that bit I could handle it quite well.

I know they're quite small things but they're still big things in my recovery that I hadn't really thought about before."

This person commented saying the post annoyed them and then when somebody asked why, he started to slate me calling me a rich snob and a load of other things (publicly). I then private messaged him just saying you’re an idiot and it was like an explosion in response. He looked at my recent posts about me asking for help about my boyfriend being down and said “I hope your gay boyfriend rapes you” and “I’m gonna watch your posts every day until your boyfriend hangs himself” I replied saying he is a freak and that it’s such a horrible thing to say and he said “I’m going to rape a woman tonight now because of this” I blocked him because I was honestly scared of this person following what I’m up to and I wanted to just cut ties with him. I’ve been thinking about what he said every day since (this was a few days ago) because I’m honestly shocked and appalled that somebody could say something so horrible and I wish I knew who it was behind the screen.

I look at their account through this throwaway account just to see what they post and stuff and it frustrates me to see that they go on about their day like a normal person and people are talking back to this person like he’s a nice guy.

I wish I could just tell everyone who knows him what he said because he is a monster. This is half a rant and half asking for advice, can anything be done about this or should I just forget it ever happened and keep him blocked?
I’m also worried he may have made a throwaway account and is monitoring my other account through that."

619,many years ago,6,gs3tfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gs3tfr/many_years_ago/,1,1590690779.0,"I am currently 23 years old, but when I was in primary school I was bullied for years. I always hated that I was never really able to retaliate, because I was passive, shy, I simply did not know how to respond. I hated him so much, he even admitted to the whole class he was doing it on purpose, still nothing changed. I have a lot of bad memories from that time, but there is one particular event I am still very proud of and I just wanted to share, so here it is.

I live in the Netherlands and we celebrate sinterklaas on the fifth of November, where we give each other gifts and candy and stuff. for the last three years of primary school, this was from age 10-12, we made suprises for each other. This is something that is also commonly done by older children or adults during sinterklaas. You draw names, so each person makes one surprise for a specific person, which is like something creative based on what this person likes, and hide gifts in it. 

When I was 11, I drew his name, the bully. The teacher knew, but she also knew about the bullying. I do not think she would have blamed me if I had decided to mess up his surprise. Right there and then however I made a choice. I could have been just like him, done something mean to get back at him, scare him, hurt him, but I wanted to be better than him. I knew my actions would decide what kind of person I chose to be. I made him the most beautiful surprise I had ever made in my young life. It was a huge football. Everyone was impressed when it was displayed in the classroom together with the other surprises. They played around with it after the bully had found the gifts hidden inside it. After all the surprises were opened we had to guess who made ours. I will never forget the look of utter suprise on his face when he realised I had been the one who made it. He never did stop bullying me unfortunately. I had hoped he'd understand there were other options, he did not have to bully me and I would forgive him, because it was better for everyone. Despite that however, I was always able to tell myself that I was a better person than him, that I had been stronger than him and that I would never let other people's mistakes change me. It gave me strength for the rest of my life and although he gave me a lot of trouble in life that lasted for so many years, I also knew that the way I responded to him and everything he did made me into the person I am today, and I would not change a thing about it."
620,Coming to terms with past bullying,6,grpu68,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/grpu68/coming_to_terms_with_past_bullying/,5,1590634538.0,"For 5 years of secondary school, I mostly didn’t fit in. I was a bit naive, I thought everyone was my friend, when I only had about 3/4 close friends. It’s come to my attention recently that some people said horrible things behind my back, and most people just didn’t like me. I was a bit loud, a bit different, and not everyone’s cup of tea.

For the past three years since I’ve left school I’ve been in college and I have flourished socially. I have lots of friends and I get on very well with most people I know. I have always been myself, but it’s like I’m now a totally new person.

Basically, although I am happy now and in a much better place, I am still struggling to come to terms with how I was perceived in school and the fact that as a result i feel unwelcome where I grew up. I hate being in my home town and feel like no one likes me. I know it’s irrational - these people don’t think about me anymore, and I shouldn’t dwell; I left school three years ago. But I still feel upset about it. I was never mean to anyone and did not deserve to be treated the way I did. Does anyone have any advice? Thank you!

TLDR; I was bullied, left out and just treated like a bit of weirdo in school. Three years later I have lots of friends in college, but I’m struggling to come to terms with how others treated me in my teenage years"

Things like ""were they really bullying you"".

I've had this problem so much in middle school. I would feel sick or have stomach aches at school often so I went to the nurse as one would do. The nurse would roll her eyes at me then when I had it bad one day I dragged my feet because yes..that's what I do when I'm in pain. She told my parents that I was being rude to her, giving her dirty looks, and stomping in her office.  I was in pain, of course, the look on my face wouldn't read ""Hello! It's so nice to see you!"". 

One time when I was in pain the nurse legit didn't care and sent me back to class after giving me a mint and boy my about to be RN mother at the time went off on her. That nurse hated my mother oh my goodness. My mother told me to call her every time I went to the nurse's office and yeah that made the nurse hate me even more.

So this happened a few years ago. I was in the darkest moments of my life when my best friend stabbed me in the back.

Not many people know that I was bullied or what happened because I don't want to seem vulnerable. I guess thats how I deal with things.

So I was already struggling with school and girls at school (I went to an all girls catholic school, I'm not even catholic). The girls at that school are brutal. I had a couple of friends in my year but I either sat with my sister and her friends or I'd sit with my other friend who was in my sister's year. They were all a couple of years older then me.

My best friend told me that a rumor had started at my school that I was a lesbian because I didn't really talk as I tried to keep to myself in class as I didn't really have anyone else. I believed my best friend. Apparently the rumor started off with two girls who one of them told these twins who told a girl who's a couple of years younger then me and didn't go to my school. That girl told my best friend's younger sister who told my best friend who told me. My best friend didn't even go to my school.

My friendship with my best friend was already strained as we had started arguing about little things and then we'd make up and it start again. 

Like I said before, I was struggling with school, the work load and this one girl with a learning disability who thought we were friends. We weren't. The amount of times I wanted to rip my hair out because of her. I cried frustrated tears in the toilets during sport one time cause I was already mad at her about something but then she wouldn't leave me alone after I abandoned my spot at the front of the line of our class (we had class lines for sport, you kno half of the girls would go on a bus to somewhere but the other half would stay at school and do sport there). It was at the start of the year and my class was about to get on the bus but I hadn't brought my ticket in to go on the bus!

Remember people, it does get better at the last second.

I had to stay at school and do soccer. Probably a good thing though as I was probably about to punch that girl in the face and it was a good chance to go cry in peace. I really didn't feel like causing a scene on the bus.

It was times like this I needed my best friend but her phone was mostly on do not disturb for school. Eventually, my best friend told me the rumor.

I think by this stage I started to cut my wrists (don't worry it only lasted a week as my mum found out after I broke down at school saying that I cut my arm and that I was sick of everything). 

I stopped seeing my best friend but I started to get curious about the rumor. So I asked my best friend about it via wattpad and she yelled at me and I'm pretty sure she blocked me. I didn't realise that my best friend probably started the rumor until the start of the year or something. 

It hurts tremendously to think that I trusted that girl with everything but I should seen the red flags and stopped seeing that girl. I regret cutting, I regret thinking that it was my fault that 

I heard that my best friend moved down to a much dodgier place in town, I'm not sure if its true or not but if it is thats sort of karma.

Though I do wonder what would happen if we'd randomly crossed paths though. Would I yell at the girl or would I ignore her? Would I walk up to her or would she walk up to me? I don't know and I really don't want to find out. I have much better friends now. After my mum found out about my cutting, she homeschooled me then my actual best friend, who I met years ago but moved away and I stopped seeing her, discovered this school who has a program called Big Picture where you choose your own learning. The program starts from Yr 9 and up. The actual mainstream starts from Yr 10 and up. I haven't found a single nasty teacher at that school. My confidence has improved a lot too. I have friends as well, both outside and inside of school.

And like I said, only a couple of people know that I was bullied or even that the rumor was a thing.

What I'd take out of what happened is see the flags before it's too late because it'll come back to bite you hard.

What would you guys do in this situation?

Thanks for listening reddit :)"
625,My ADHD step daughter is a bully,6,ecez0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ecez0o/my_adhd_step_daughter_is_a_bully/,6,1576715905.0,"I'm hoping to get some advice from others about my situation.  Here's the background:  I am a widowed father of three boys.  And I have a live in girlfriend who has two boys and a girl.    The girl (we'll call her Belle) has pretty bad ADHD.  She is 10 years old, the same age as my youngest son.   Belle's father doesn't pay any attention to her, so she has daddy issues.   Belle receives constant counselling and psychotherapy, and she has been in and out of hospitals.   She is also on a ton of prescription medication.

My youngest kid (Joseph) has a mild form of autism.   He often struggles to communicate with me and his teachers, and to stand up for himself.    When questioned on something, he will often ""admit"" to doing something we know he didn't do.  He does that in hopes to end the interrogation or to befriend the questioner.

Belle loves to bully Joseph (also 10 years old).    She will pull his hair, throw things at him, and verbally taunt/bully him until he is in tears.   She finds him to be an easy target I think.  Most of the time this occurs when nobody else is around.   So when Joseph comes to me in tears telling me what happened, she denies the whole thing.    Belle's mother then starts questioning my son,  telling him to ""quit lying"", which upsets him even more.   Honestly, I didn't see what happened so I often never get the truth.    

I confront Belle's mother on this, and she becomes very defensive about her daughter's behavior.    She says she's doing everything she can for her daughter, but my kids are liars and they should be the ones being punished.    It gets even worse when I try to confront Belle directly.   She will bully me also, calling me an f'in a-hole and about every swear word in the book.  The other day she threw a new xbox controller at my groin, the controller broke.   I again confront Mom, and she tells me to back off her daughter and does nothing to discipline or set boundaries.

Advice please?   Is there someone I can get involved who might help?"

When I arrive, they tell me that the man next door is a less than desirable neighbor, but not to worry about it. As time progresses, this grown grumpy old man neighbor 55+, begins to show his colors, as he will verbally harass me out of the blue as I walk into the house, yelling all sorts of of cuss words and obscenities and generally mean bad vibed things to say to another person. He is drunk 100% of the time and stands out front in front of his grill which he keeps on the front lawn instead of the back ? I usually just ignore it I did contact the police one time when he was making gun threats. Anyways, as for the most recent incident In question. I pull my car up and park off the drive way but behind the last car in it, so I’m in the culdesac but out of the way enough that anyone would still be able to do a turn around. I am walking in talking on my phone and again he is verbally harassing me, which I ignore, but then as I enter the home and look out one of the street view windows, I see him approaching my car. Not sure if I locked the doors or not, I go outside and try to use my remote lock to no avail ( I think it needs a new battery) so anyways I start filming him cause I think he is either going to vandalize my car or worse yet get inside of it and do something ? So I go out and tell him I’m filming and he should step away from my vehicle. Which he doesn’t. As I start to walk down the driveway to approach my car and lock it manually ( i was not done in the house didn’t plan on leaving yet didn’t want him by the unlocked car. ) he then sprints around my car in between my car and me and comes right up to me and puts his body on my body and tells me to “do something about it” to which I reply get out of my way I am going to my car, as I attempt to get around him again he positions himself between me and my vehicle and tells me we are going to fight. My response was to go in and call the police because I really am not interested in physical confrontation. Of course he runs in his home as the police arrive, and me officer makes it seem to be a what can they really do type situation. And I don’t think he is wrong. So my question is, what do I Do in a situation where the bully actively goes out of his way to engage me? There have been many incidents and they seem to get more “violent” each time. Fighting is pointless and petty pranks are pointless, I wanted to see if the reddit hive mind maybe had any advice for me. Thanks for reading and please advise."

TRIGGER WARNING: SELF HARM, ABUSE, ANXIETY, SUICIDE, CYBER STALKING

This story starts for me when I was in high school. I was dating this guy (let's call him Alan) and our relationship was terrible. He was one of my first real ""boyfriends"" and so I didn't really know the signs of red flags at that point in time since I was a naive little high schooler. However, my parents and friends recognized that our relationship was bad, and were constantly mad and annoyed with me about him. My parents took away my phone so that I couldn't text him and my computer so that I couldn't email him, and he didn't seem to care that I was getting in trouble and my friends were isolating me, he just kept saying that they were jealous they didn't understand our love. Eventually, I had had enough, and I started to see the bad side of him. He soon became verbally and physically abusive, and I didn't ever tell anyone because I was scared. I broke up with him after being with him for about 4-5ish months, and that's when things started to get crazy. Shortly after I broke up with him, someone from school had told me that he was dating someone else right away. This made me a little upset, but eventually I didn't care. I looked on his instagram and saw that he had posted a picture of a girl that was named Sarah (not the real name). He tagged her in the post, and I clicked on her account because I was curious. She only had 2 pictures, one being the same that Alan had posted of her on his account, and another of a clearly different girl. Yet, she had tagged HERSELF in those pictures, they were both blonde girls and looked similar, but it almost seemed as if she was trying to say that they were both her. Anyways, Alan started telling EVERYONE at our high school about his new girlfriend named Sarah, and since our high school was very small, everyone knew about it. He told people that he had met her in the summer at the rec center when they were in the same massage class (I don't know, that's just what he said). He said that she was 18 (we were all 15 at the time) and that she had locked him in the bathroom and made him let her give him a blowjob. He also told people that he was just dating me so make Sarah jealous (which I knew wasn't true, he told me all the time how he only wanted me and wanted a life together) and he wanted Sarah to come back to him. 

Anyways, I went about my life getting over Alan until I started receiving follow requests on my instagram and snapchat from accounts that were all called ""sendnudes"" and then a bunch of numbers either after or before it. This happened on both my instagram and snapchat, which was really scary, but I just kept blocking the accounts. However, multiple times a day, they would request to follow me, and I would block them, and they would make a new account, over and over and over. I didn't want to tell my parents because I had just gotten them to trust me again after me and Alan's bad relationship ended. This went on for about a month until I finally just let them follow my account to see what they wanted (I know, I was a stupid high schooler).  Once I let them follow me, they started sending me pictures of my younger brother who had gone to my school that were taken while he was at school, as well as my mom, who was on staff at my high school during that time, while she was working. They also sent me pictures of my moms car and the outside of my school, saying that they were going to hurt me and find me if I didn't send them nudes. I didn't know what else to do so I just blocked the accounts over and over again. This was around the same time I began getting messages from Sarah, saying all these bad things about how Alan never liked me and basically cyberbullying me. I blocked her account and when I saw Alan in school I told him to tell Sarah to stop being terrible to me. He said that he had no idea she had done that. I just avoided him at school after that because I was upset with him. 

On a side note, I had a friend that went to my school who liked to make memes. She would look up random pictures on the internet to use like stockphotos and other clip art type images. She was trying to make a meme about ""dumb blondes"" and when she was searching for a picture to use for that, she came across a picture of Sarah, who was in a stock photo. When searching ""blonde teenage girls"" on the internet, both pictures that Sarah had posted on her instagram came up, and the websites connected to the pictures found that these girls had different names. So, the photos of ""sarah"" on her account weren't actually her they were just stockphotos. Weird right? It'll make sense later. 

After a while, some news went around my school that Alan's girlfriend Sarah was in the hospital (in a small school news travels fast). At this point in time me and Alan hadn't really talked all that much since we broke up because I was mad at him for being mean about his new girlfriend. However, I felt like I needed to reach out and see if he was okay, he had been crying at school and leaving class frequently or not going at all. I texted him asking if he was okay and if he needed to talk about what was going on. He replied right away saying that Sarah was in the hospital because she got shot and was most likely not gonna make it. Apparently robbers had broken into her house in the middle of the night and shot at her. I told him I was sorry to hear that and hoped that everything would be okay. And the follow requests from ""sendnudes"" on my social media had continued.

About a week later, Alan posted a picture of a blonde girl in a hospital bed, with Sarah's account tagged, and the caption reading ""Heaven received an angel today, rest in peace sarah."" Meaning that Sarah had passed away. Alan didn't come to school that next day, and the day after that he cried all day and kept leaving during class. That was around the same time I decided to tell my parents about the ""sendnudes"" guy and everything that had happened with Alan and Sarah. I didn't know what else to do, and I was starting to get more and more scared since they started to text me on my phone number too. I would block them and they would keep texting me over and over with a new number and send me pictures of my friends at school. They also said that ""If I told anyone they would hurt me and everyone I cared about."" After I told my parents, they told me I needed to talk to the school counselors about it. When I went to have a meeting with the school counselor and dean about it, they basically told me there wasn't anything that they could do unless I wanted to get the police involved, and even then if I didn't have any idea who it was there wasn't much the police could do since they kept making new numbers and accounts 50 times a day. They suggested that if it went on another month then to get police involved, and that police usually advise waiting a certain amount of time to involve them because in most cases the stalker will give up after about 6 months. 

And it did, but shortly after the meeting with the counselor, I started dating another guy at my school. We'll call him Nico. When I started dating Nico, he already knew about the whole ""sendnudes"" thing because we had been in the same friend group for a long time and I confided in him about that, and he agreed that if it kept happening for another month then I should talk to my parents about calling the police. A few weeks after me and Nico started being official, I got a text from ""sendnudes"" that said he was outside my house and would break in and hurt my cats if I didn't send him what he wanted. And if he found out I told anyone, he would find everyone I love and hurt them. He sent me a picture from outside of my house, saying that if I just gave him what he wanted then he would leave me alone forever. I was at school at the time and it was in the middle of the day, and I absolutely panicked, I ran out of class. I went into the bathroom and sent him a picture of myself (a nude). Being young and naive and scared, I didn't realize the consequences of sending a nude to someone, especially since I was underage. After that I went down to my mom's office and told her I was feeling sick and needed to go home, so she called my dad and he picked me up from school. When I got home, I cried in bed the rest of the day and cuddled my cats, relieved that they were safe and that my family and friends were safe. 

After I sent the picture, I was relieved to not have 50 follow requests and texts everyday from this ""sendnudes"" person. I didn't think that anyone would find out, but I was wrong. Two weeks after I sent the picture, someone had sent that nude in a mass text to every student in my grade, as well as emails to the counselors and dean. With my full name in the subject box. I was immediately called in to the admin office. However, the dean and counselors didn't take my side. I was stupid and told them that it wasn't me, because I was afraid that if I told them, then the ""sendnudes"" person would find me and hurt me. They interrogated me for hours, and asked me about anyone who could've sent it relating to me. Everyone that I mentioned was brought into the office and asked questions, it was a full on investigation. Once they called Alan, he kept saying over and over that he had nothing to do with it. After that, the admin had no choice but to call the police. 

They interrogated me for hours, but I was so scared to tell them the truth, and I should've but I was so scared. The police officer told me that he had a feeling that it was Alan, so they called him in, and he admitted to everything. He was the ""send nudes"" person, and was trying to use those nudes to get back at me for breaking up with him. Also, it turned out that Sarah was in fact a fake person, and he made her up and her fake instagram account to make me jealous, which makes sense why ""her"" photos were online, because they weren't even a real person. When he made her ""die,"" he was trying to use that to make me feel bad for him and eventually get back together with him. He had his friend drive him to my house and take pictures of the outside, and since he went to my school he was able to take pictures of my friends and brother and mom. 

The police ended up searching both our phones, and they found that he had about 50 pictures of me that he had taken during class, and they were mostly pictures of my butt that he had taken when I wasn't looking. They found out that he had screenshotted the nude of me before it got around the school, which means that he was the first one to have it. And Alan straight up told them that I sent it to them. They also found his 200+ instagram accounts, snapchat accounts, and texting app accounts that he had been using to send me the messages. 

Because this was a case of child pornography and I was the one who sent the picture, I ended up getting suspended for two weeks, and missed all my finals. Alan got suspended for 2 days because of the bullying. My dean said that the two weeks was a less severe punishment, as I was very close to being expelled. I got grounded for the whole summer by my parents and had to sign a legal document saying that I wasn't allowed on social media until the next school year started. This eventually led to my mom quitting her job at my school because I ruined her reputation and it was too much for her to handle since her bosses treated her differently because of it. I lost a lot of my friends and don't really use social media that much anymore. That summer I never felt so alone, I ended up hating myself and felt unimaginable guilt. I turned to self harm and just wanted to die because of how bad I felt. I attempted suicide twice, and I never told my parents anything. My dean, principal, and all my counselors saw me naked, and everyone at school thought I was a slut. I still sometimes deal with the anxiety and embarrassment that had followed. 

One thing I will say is that eventually things do get better. I want everyone reading this who has ever been a victim of bullying, cyberstalking, abusive relationships, or revenge porn to understand that everything will be okay. There are people that can help you that you can trust, and there are ways to make things better. There is more to life than high school, and you can always start over and be the person that you want to be. There is someone out there that will love you no matter what crap you've gone through, and everything will be okay."

On the first day the other kids picked on me for ruining the class. I was the 20th kid in the class it was room 19. That’s why they were a$$holes. This end on the last day of that year as a vary small kid I thought I was done with school for life but I came back after summer. No body said anything about me “ruining the class” but they did say thing to me like, go away the school hates you your not smart enough to be here we are the cool kids. They did not let me play with the toys witch as a kid making this now “I’m 11 I still like toys but not like when I was 4 I hated tv back then I just played with my toys so that was the worst thing ever to me back then. Then grade 1 came along they hated me because I was to short to be in grade 1 I was the shortest in my class and I still am in my family and my 6th grade class but damn grade 1 kids your all pricks. So I just hide from them at outside time and gym “we did gym outside wether it was winter of fall or below -30” witch would get me in trouble with the teachers. It was the same thing up until grade 2 In April. I left that school I was so, so happy. Then I was crushed. That new school was so much worst the teachers did nothing about them I would get grabed by the neck and punched and they would just make them say sorry wtf is that going to do. So I slowly fell into depression I wanted to just end my own life but my love for my family kept me going. So I just stayed home from school with got CPS at my door luckily I was not taken away. But I never told them the bully’s said that the school said they want them to bully me as a small kid I believed them I had and still have depression and anxiety. I thought about getting a knife and just killing myself. Then I snapped and yelled at them witch got me sent to the principals office. Hated my life I was physical and mentally abused I was so sad all the time then in grade 5 I left the school and. Went to a new school in grade 6 now I have many friends and foes bully are always in schools but I was so bad at all but rumors spread like a fire they said that me and my best friend who we will call ken for meckenzie that’s what me and my friends call her anyway they said we were in love and kissed each other after school and wanted to get married when we were older but the school got vary mad at the kids who said and then for the first time in my life the teachers helped me with my bullying problem and me and ken are still friends and so are me and the other kids “not the kids who spread the rumors” I am finally in a good school I just hope my next school is ok to I am graduation this year going into grade 7 - 12 hopefully high school will be ok will the bully’s from my last school be their

I'm not a confrontational person but at the same time I have gotten into plenty of fights over it and afterwards that specific bully would stop but another would arise like magic🤦🏾‍♂️. I got to a point that I've even contemplated killing one of my bullies but he moved away before I really got to plotting. And one thing I heard was ""you never expect to get beat up by a bitch because they're a bitch"" and where I'm from not being emotional and confrontational is what gets you called a bitch most times (the hood). So when I did fight ppl would be surprised that I knew how but that only made them also bully the ppl who bullied me along with me. But at this point how do I escape being bullied? I'm a senior and it's one of my worst years for bullying and that just fucking sad man because why are we 17 and 18 and making other ppls lives a living hell in this super liberal environment? But at the same time all of this shit taught me that no one gives a shit abt your story in the real world and little to no one feels sorry for you and that's a fact.

Today one of them thought it's funny to pinch my cheeks. I just had to push his hand away. I just had to and it was even instinctive. It was extremely uncomfortable. I hope this action doesn't make me the bad guy.

Anyway, I'm finding it extremely difficult to confront them. I've been documenting the bullying incidents lately, but so far I only have three incidents documented (one of them minor and only a text message by one of them calling me ""child"" to which I did not respond, I also have a screenshot of it). I just can't take their stupid bullying anymore and I now even fear coming to work (been working from home A LOT because of them).

Would those three incidents be enough evidence? Should I go to my boss now, or document a few more incidents first? I want their bullying to stop already but I feel unable to make it stop on my own. I really don't know what to do."

Some other people I know have recently decided to disassociate from me under their influence. These people either completely ignore me, act weirdly around me or make snide remarks about me that I don't understand the context of. 

The friend has a sort of superiority complex, and it seems the motive for them doing this in the first place is to punish me for hanging out with other people. Right now they seem pretty pleased with themselves and act overly nice to me.

I've never stood up for myself in the past and want to learn how to. I don't want to give the impression of admittance or guilt and give room for the gossip to spread. I'm unsure if I should mention my situation to some newer friends I've made and make myself that vulnerable.

What methods should I use to stand up for myself?"

When I was in the 6th grade a new kid came to our school and we treated him very well but he didn’t be nice  back. He would call every girl a bitch after anything they said he would start fights with kids over nothing. And then that’s where I come in. In the 7th grade he somehow made some friends that did the exact same thing and I’m a very heavy boy and very overweight so he would call me fat ask me when the baby is due things like that and then one day...

Cast:

B=Bully
B2=Bully 2
Me=me
P=principle 
MD=My Da
RL=random lady

So one day B and B2 swindled me into buying them bubble tea and they would pay me back. So I did and the next day B2 payed me back but B didn’t also it cost 5$ and B had a 5$ bill in his hand but claimed it was for someone else so I told him the next day to bring it and this when on until the following week until they ran away with the money and then I started crying because I just wanted to go home and then this happens

Me:PLEASE JUST GIVE IT TO ME I JIST WANT TO GO HOME

B&amp;B2: COME AND GET IT

Random lady stops us

RL: why are you crying?

Me:because they won’t give me my money (still crying)

RL: give him his money

And then he did som then I started walking home (I lived very close) 5 mins pass then

B: dude I need the money (gave it to me in coins)

Me: no

B: I need it for the bus

Me: that sucks

B2: If you don’t give it to him you’re a disgrace to your family 

B2: GIVE IT TO HIM 

Me: “ starts running” 

B&amp;B2 faking tying in there shoes 

Me: LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE

And then I start throwing rocks at them so that they leave alone as a defense mechanic and I get to a crosswalk and there’s another kid there and they start trying to convince him to go tell the principal that they are the victim and they do but he dosent go with them

I go home still crying 

MD: What happend?

Me: I tell him what happened 

MD: that is so bad I’m going to go find them

20 mins later 

MD: I didn’t find them but I’m going to tell the principal also don’t go to school tomorrow 

2 Days later at principals office with the bully’s after telling her what happend:

P: so (me) you shouldn’t have thrown the rocks and talked to a stranger 

Me: but what about them

P:  it dosent matter they are the victim 

My dad had to convince the principal that I was the victim

So that’s my story nothing happend to anyone so thanks for reading

EDIT: I’m in the 8th grade now

EDIT 2: all of this happened after school and no one was there except for the kid at the crosswalk and the random lady"

Why can't these little kids these days do the same?  

Don't tell your parents shit & never tell the teacher shit.  Just punch your bully in the face & he/she will leave you alone.

Now he was super duper mad and he took it so seriously to he said to big tall and assmeat2 that I was being super mean and we should not be friends any more. The three of them decided that they where gonna make my life hard and they for one year. So the three of them decided that they should make rumors to the class  about me. One of the rumors was that I peed myself in pe and everyone took it so seriously if and if I was an animal. The next one was that I liked the smell of shit and that people should shit on me.

He was taller and bigger but I had a rage like no other and I said push me again and then he tried and then I lost control, years of bullying and suppressing released.  I had no ability to stop. I kept punching him and grabbed his tie since we went to a prep school and kept punching him and then he was knocked out on the ground then I put his head and jaw over the curb and curbed all his teeth in. It wasn’t until after I saw what I did and all the blood. I was afraid of jail and what would happen to me. So I kinda ran away put the kid was apparently to embarrassed to press charges and I got suspended for 10 days and after I came back not a single soul at school said another thing to me and they all feared me.

I feel it is impossible to stop bullying. Why? Well because think about it this way. Why does someone choose to bully someone else? It can be many reasons, life at home is not good such as bad parents abusive alcoholic or just not being there and many other factors or just want to be “cool” so what do we do we punish the child and tell their parents then what happens they get in trouble with their parents and get even more upset that they were told on and now they pick on the child even more and it just gets worse the bully now gets in more trouble (suspended or expelled) so the parents discipline him more maybe they even hit him so he gets more anger built up and he targets more and other students and where does this lead us? To the child getting bullied he feels that no one is looking out for him or helping him so he just holds it all in everyday for as long as he can then guess what he just can’t hold it in anymore so 1 of 2 things happen they kill themself or they become a school shooter and then they blame everything and everyone but the bully. The bully never learns what he does is wrong and just moves on to pick on someone else and it starts all over. So in my opinion I can’t stop bullying because you can’t stop the source parents will never be able to teach their child not to pick on others. Everyone picks on someone at some point in their life. That’s all I got to say. ( yes girls get bullied too and no they don’t shoot it schools most girls that get bullied end their own life which is just sad) tell me what you think we can do or how you think we can stop bullying and be realistic."

Last thursday, he bullied me and other people (mostly me) and he made comments about my hair because it's short (I am a girl with a male haircut). He made comments like ""You look like a boy"" (I replied with ""And you look like a girl"") , and ""If I cried a lot"". He said it with this disgusting grin of his. (And it wasn't the only time he made fun of me. Last year he made fun of my name a lot.) Because he said many disgusting things about my hair, I asked him seriously if he was homophobic (because I am homosexual and I normally don't hate people that are homophobic because it's their own opinion but I hate people that seriously make fun of homosexuals). He and his group (this was during English class) made fun about the question and he made fun about he being homophobic. After a few minutes he said :""Do you cry a lot?"" with his distgusting grin. That's when my mind snapped. I took my craft knife (I use it for cutting paper because I don't like scissors), stood up and went to his seat. I was holding the crafting knife against the back of his shoulder. And screamed at him how shitty that what he did was. The other ones from his group were shocked because I was normally quiet and sometimes a little bit loud (talking and joking around with my friends). He still had his disgusting grin on his face and was even laughing. After a few seconds I went back to my seat. I cried.
Yesterday, we had to talk to our teacher about what happened. And today we had to talk to another teacher that is trying to ""help us"". The bully lied at almost every point. He said that O started it with saying that he looks like a girl (I never even tried talking to him because I loathe him), that we were totally mean to him, that I held the knife (it's a crafting knife and it isn't even more dangerous than scissors because scissors are a lot bigger than crafting knife) against his arm and that his friends told him that I even held it against his neck. I and a friend of mine who was also made fun of by him (she is homosexual too) told the teacher the truth. But the teacher talked like I am going to get WAY MORE trouble than him. The teacher also said that I have to apologise to him. I just can't because he never apologised to anyone he bullied or even felt sorry for he has done. He is even spreading lies about me (exactly what he told the teachers) and says not crafting knife but only knife (when people think of knifes, they think about the big knifes that are used for cooking) and he pretends to be completely innocent. Have I done the right thing and what consequenses will I maby face? (side note: I'm from Germany) I thank everyone in advance that tries to help me."

654,"I'm gonna end my friendship with my ""friend""",5,cwk5hn,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cwk5hn/im_gonna_end_my_friendship_with_my_friend/,7,1567024290.0,"This is an update from my previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bjepli/help_me_deal_with_this_bully/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app



So here we go again. This so called ""friend"" of mine was such a jerk to me everytime we hang with our other friends. This summer, we watched Spiderman: Far From Home with our other friends. When we were walking after we go out of the theater from the post credits, he randomly hit my head with his hand. I told him to stop but he doesn't take it seriously. Then after the walk to the mall's bus stop, we boarded a bus. Later, while in the middle of the journey, he told one friend of ours to hit my head. Then, of course my friend hit me like my other friend told him to. After what happened, only two of our friends were left on the bus. One is my close friend and other is my ""friend"". And sometime later, we are in queue for a medical test in a university. I have a bike parked somewhere in the distance. My friend and my ""friend"" went to check my bike out. Then they returned to me. My ""friend"" claimed that my bike's tire was flat. So I foolishly believed him and me and my ""friend"" went to check on my bike. However, upon getting to my ride, I was actually fine. It's tire isn't flat! Then so my ""friend"" ran away from me, thus beginning a chase. However I regret chasing him because there are alot of people in the area and I assume he is trying to embarass me (which he does to me all the time whenever he's around me). Sometime later, in a GC (group chat on Messenger) he suddenly insulted me with very insultive jokes. My classmate posted on her My Day a video, which included myself in it and we are having fun in that video. However, my ""friend"" screenshot a ridiculous frame of the video which includes me. And he made fun of me. He called me ""pineapple"" just because of my haircut. Also I forgot to mention that I'm already wearing glasses and he also ridicules me for that too. And BTW, he noticed that I'm good at socializing with other students in our new school. But he keeps on saying that I'm a ""wannabe-famous person"", says the stupid ""friend"" of mine who is insecure and delusional. I'm really angry right now while typing this. It's like he keeps judging whatever I wear, my haircut, anything. One time I called him out on our GC of friends but he didn't even take it seriously. Also he keeps on using ""just joking"" as an excuse to his so-called ""jokes"". He often calls me ""AIDS, Mercuringo"" (my last name has ""ingo"" in it, so I'm not telling my real surname) and many other insults that he mixes with Freddie Mercury's name (he often insults me just because I'm a Queen fan, not to mention that he indirectly insults the singer too). Lastly, I called his big brother but his big brother said that we are grown ups already and told me to talk to him (my ""friend"") whenever he (""friend"") insults me. (I called my ""friend"" out alot of times before and all he said that I was overreacting but he doesn't know that it's verbal abuse). Finally, whenever I make a mistake, he often makes fun of me for it, instead of simply correcting me. Ow before you say that I can't take jokes, I can take a joke. But compared to jokes that are meant to be humurous, the jokes of my ""friend"" are meant to offend, criticize, damage my image, and he uses those ""jokes"" to gain power. Please help me out on this. One more thing. Back in 8th grade (I'm 11th grade currently), he used to be a good, playful person. But in the 10th grade, he seem to got worse and I got confused why he's acting nothing like my friend used to be. So please, just help me out on this. I tolerated his ""jokes"" tons of times now and I still tried to be friendly and quiet as possible to him (also I NEVER insulted him one time) but nothing seems to work. Comment something helpful. Peace."

There was a girl was another school who was in my year she was really popular everyone liked her. She messed with me physically and mentally it’s been 4 years and I haven’t stopped questioning myself as to whether it actually happened, if I said something to her or if I was jealous. It has been eating me alive since it happened I got pulled out of school to homeschool my social anxiety has skyrocketed I just can’t seem to let go of it and it’s really starting to hit me now. My doctor told me it’s because she seen me as a threat but I don’t know why I’m unattractive, not smart and an outcast. Has anyone else ever felt like this?"

I had a learning disability, a weirdly spelled name, and was a fat kid, so I was pretty much a bully buffet. It was the same shit nearly every recess; laughing, name calling, goading me into chasing them. Because I was a big boy, not too many kids tried to beat me up, and the ones that did were either bigger than or as big as me. 

The school where it first started was in the same area I lived, which had a lot of drug and gang activity. It closed last year. I went to several different schools in my area growing up due to different circumstances, but it never changed.

But what hurt worse than kids who picked on me from the start were kids who BEFRIENDED me first only to join the masses later on. It happened with every single friend I made as a child. Because of that, I've never been able to keep long term friends. The whole are I grew up in was basically one big clique and I was their whipping boy. I left my hometown shortly after graduating high school to go to college, haven't moved back since and never will because I despise it and everyone in it for what they did to me.

Like I said, I DESPISE children. They're nothing but vicious little thugs. Every time I see someone flaunting baby pictures or pictures of their kids on Facebook I just wanna puke. Everyone likes to say kids are adorable, but to me, they're just demons in disguise. Whenever people mope about a school shooting, I just shrug it off - those shooters probably did the world a favour. God knows I wish I had the balls to shoot up MY school (or schools, I should say).   

Fuck children."

I use humor as a protection mechanism. I am very strong and have that “nothing brings me down” image. So my husband is often frustrated that l “bully our poor friend with my jokes and comments”. I ask him doesn’t he see that they are not fair to me. But he says that’s all in my head and I think that the whole world is against me and I have to fight everything.

I know what it is like to be rejected. I was bullied twice. I was bullied by these three boys in fifth grade. They would constantly call me names. I reported it and it got even worse. I kept getting kicked in the shin constantly. Then my friend texted my parents and they made me report it. Then in sixth grade, I was bullied again by this one boy, but I knew how to ignore it and stand up for myself. I  reported it to the teacher and had it stopped. But I still experience the after-affects. I am constantly afraid of being bullied at school. I am afraid that someone may turn out to be a bully, so that's why I don't talk to people much. I am afraid that someone, somewhere has targeted me.  I always try not to appear vulnerable so that people don't target me. Even when the bullying's over, it seems like it's never really over."
659,Bullying on Smule singing app and elsewhere. Just so sick of feeling like I’m not a person or likeable by anyone.,5,colmv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/colmv6/bullying_on_smule_singing_app_and_elsewhere_just/,1,1565490227.0,"So I sing a lot on the popular Smule app for karaoke on my iPhone. I have probably about 1000 followers and I’ve met a lot of really close friends on there and it’s been one of the best experiences of my life over the last two years that’s got me through a lot of shit.

You know it makes me really upset that this one person I know on Smule I accidentally called her Kim instead of Karen on a live jam in front of 20 people MONTHS ago and she’s like this Irish annoying fucking bitch whatever Miss popular 15000 followers. 

And she has this picture up on her cover photo all drunk with her rocking the cradle bf for her Smule profile and she’s wearing some stupid hat that has stuff written all over it in the very middle it says IM NOT KIM in huge letters With an  arrow pointing down. 

And you know what that whole group of people I was becoming relatively close with because I have a good voice now I’m like a laughing stock to the whole community and “ everyone will ask what does I’m not Kim mean?” because of one stupid comment I made when I thought I got her name wrong accidentally. and now the whole Internet is going to be spreading like wildfire because of the picture possibly and they’ll hear the story about me and maybe learn my user name and I don’t know. Sometimes people even come into live jams and say fag or your voice is terrible or whatever and they get blocked immediately and banned and reported. It happens to a lot more people than just me and it’s just not a thing that that needs to happen there or it ever needs to happen anywhere.

and she made me feel like absolute shit just like in college or high school when people suck and all made fun of me in a group and it sucked balls and I feel like bullies are still everywhere and it really hurt my feelings. 

I have borderline personality disorder and PTSD or whatever fuck is going wrong with me. I’m going through a very nasty divorce where my kids of been taken for me several times because of my narcissistic ex-wife and her control over me and bullying to that extent for 8 years.

I am much happier now and completely in love with another woman and moving on with my life. My now fiancé and I who reunited with after 14 years after both getting divorced now at the same time ironically. We dated when we were younger and she’s my true soulmate who I should’ve always been with. 

Also i’ve had so much great support From my kids and my family through all the shit I’ve been through and they are realizing more that I have mental health issues that I’ve been through a lot of shit over the last 20 years to my life dealing with bullies and people being so mean and shitty whether kids at school or girlfriends or the kind of people that radiate towards me that just want to pick me apart and make me feel like I’m a piece of shit and I should just die.

I barely have any friends in a lot due to borderline personality disorder I have a habit of pushing away people before they can hurt me so of course naturally I blocked that whole group of people on Smule because I don’t want to deal with anymore of the shit even though they’re probably honestly not that bad in hindsight. I’ve done the same thing for years on Facebook we’re all delete like 100 friends and then add them back and then delete them again and it’s up cycle I don’t know it’s fucking crazy. 

Even people I’ve known for years sometimes I can still be paranoid about their true intentions of hurting me, especially after someone like my ex-wife I was with for eight years in a marriage just completely turned into a different person and has been one of the biggest if not the biggest bully of my life. 

I fall on the emotional spectrum of an empath and a HSP and I read an article about how narcissists and empaths can interact and how we can completely destroy a person like me like what she’s doing to me right now through this divorce (you don’t even want to know what’s going on right now in this divorce that’s a different post in a different subreddit. She is such a bully and she is so messed up. )

Ok... lol 🤦‍♂️.... Here’s a quick highlight. Not my kid but she hid a pregnancy from me for nine months. Also my dog died three months ago and I found out a week ago through my KIDS who are six and eight. Now we are in the final stages of divorce and she’s withholding my kids for me every other weekend so I haven’t seen them in a month. 


I’ve been in therapy often on for years and right now it’s going very well and I’m taking the lamotrigine for any issues that are going on in my brain. With great success and comfort for the first time in a very long time if not ever. That may help me focus and feel happier on a day-to-day basis but it can’t rid bullies of the world unfortunately. 😟

Sorry if I’m rambling I’m just a little high too and talking into Siri instead of typing and went back to fix typos if any lol."

We were on a school tour and long story short I got kicked in the face by a football it was really sore and the ball came in fast. few weeks later in school that guy hit me with in the back of the head with a pencil case. He has also done a few more things but the worst is the looks I get from him they're quite intimidating tbh. I act like they're nothing to me but it's so hard at times. But that's enough of him.

There are other times when I get called names like one guy said I looked like an alien. I know it was supposed to be a joke  but it hurt because other people laughed. I don't get psychically assaulted really so I can't report it. It just comes down to people being cunts but *It's the small things that build up to larger mental pain in my head and that is what the worst about it is.* 

I guess there is nothing I can do just suck it up and hurt myself to help me deal with it. I tried asking my mother to switch school but she said its two more years so I have to just deal with it."

**FUCK YOU.**

     You had a negative impact on my life. You screwed with me, messed with me, harmed me, bullied me, were rude, mean, and unkind. What did I ever do to you besides being nice? I don't understand why you bullied me. You had no *good* reason to. Maybe you were jealous, or maybe that's what you experienced at home, or maybe you were so consumed with yourself and how to make yourself seem better that you picked on the vulnerable, the ugly, the nice, and easy targets. Perhaps you were just purely mean, and I believe that some of you still are to this day.

     You picked on me at a young age. I was smart. You maybe felt threatened or combative. I was a teacher's pet, and you didn't like that. What the fuck is wrong with being nice to an adult? Maybe you didn't have adults in your life that were compassionate back to you, and if you didn't, I am so sorry. That sucks and isn't right. But neither were your comments or bullying.

      In fifth grade, you turned the lights out on me in the bathroom. You were insensitive if I liked someone. You didn't invite me over or spend time with me outside of school. By sixth grade, you were doing the same things, but only more. You told me that I couldn't be friends with you, that I wasn't good enough to be your friend or in your friend group, and that I could be friends with your dead pets. That was 100% not okay. How would you feel if someone said that to you? You always told me to take a joke, but I don't think you were joking.

     In middle school, I was too ugly. I didn't have nice teeth, and you let me know that. I developed a little quicker than some and got teased for that. Who looks at someone else's bra to find out the size and then tells other people? I got called fat, that I couldn't see my toes, when in reality, I was pretty thin and very healthy. Thanks for screwing me up.

     To those of you who never directly said anything harmful to me, screw you, too. You stood by idly while your ""friends"" were mean to me. You could have stood up, you could have stopped this, or at least tried, but you didn't. You were loyal to your friends, but never chose to side with the underdog or practice citizenship, respect, responsibility, or even act out your faith, if you really had one, which is so sad to me. You could have been a light and shined brighter than acts of bullying, but did you? No.

     On the bus, you were mean. In the locker room, on the court, in the dugout, the hallway, and pretty much everywhere you could be. You were unkind, forgot about me, put me in harm, and didn't help me get out. Even some of the adults didn't seem to care about your actions. You hit be with a lacrosse stick, you barked at me for getting water. What the fuck? You aren't and weren't the boss of me, so what made you think that you were? You were entitled, controlling, domineering, and honestly, a lot of you were just bitches most of the time.

     You didn't want me to eat lunch with you, or you didn't want to eat lunch with me. I wasn't invited to any of your birthday parties, I never was asked to spend time with you outside of school, you got me into trouble sometimes for WANTING to be with you. You bullied me to make me feel bad, but in all reality, I should have never given you that power. Unfortunately, as a child, I didn't know how to stop that. In fact, this plagues me to this day. I don't understand how or why, but clearly, this is still a problem that I experience. Thankfully, I don't think about you all very often, but when I do, there is anger, but mostly sadness. Sadness for the little girl who did NOTHING wrong, yet, was still teased all of the time. The girl who was kind, great at school, fun, and decent at sports got teased for anything and everything. It was lonely. There is resentment, for sure. I know that sometimes I think of you and get mad, and sometimes I think of you and am just so glad and so relieved that I don't have to see you or spend time with you anymore. 13 years of the same people got fucking old very fast.

     I guess what I am trying to say is goodbye to that chapter of my life. I don't want to think about these things or be plagued by the memories any more. If that means not returning to my childhood home or totally removing my social presence, I may have to do that. You all were evil, like monsters to me. I feel confused and warped by your presence in my life. You taught me to shut up and repress. You also made fun of me for being mad at you. What the heck? At the same time, I want to embrace it as a part of me.

     I realize that this part of my life is part of my story that I can not exclude, but I want you to know that as an adult, you have no power over me any longer, and I truly hope that you have changed your ways. Being inconsiderate doesn't get you far in life. Neither does cheating, stealing, spreading lies, rumors, being hurtful, or abusive. I hope that you are better now, but at the same time, I don't think I could ever be friends with you. You hurt me too much, too often, and too hard. The one good thing that came out of all of this is that I appreciate my TRUE friends, the ones who actually love and care for me, so much more than I think I would have if you were kinder to me growing up. I am allowed to feel this way about you, but I think most of the time, I brush it off and play it like a joke. Maybe I didn't have the tools, resources, and supports that I needed to overcome your crap and not take it personally, but child-me had no way of acquiring those skills. They say people do the best that they can, and now that I have those skills, I am going to do better. I just haven't figured out exactly how yet. I know that I will do the following, though: feel my feelings, name my feelings, seek out professional and personal help, meditate, pray, talk about this a little bit more with trusted individuals, be grateful, continue to stand up, journal, allow myself to be upset or whatever else I may feel, and encourage myself to lean into the love that I have already surrounding me.

     I don't want to harbor resentment, and thankfully, I don't think about you often. You were rude and mean. I'd love if there was justice, but I don't think there will be. You've made me recognize how prevalent bullying and hurtful comments are, which makes me stand up for and side with those who are being bullied, but I don't think you will ever change. I don't think you realize how hurtful you were or are, but even if you did, would you alter your actions? Probably not. A lifetime of habits is a lot to change, but my hope is that if you recognize the pain that you cost, you would be sorry."

One day when i had turned my back to walk out the shout he made a huge insult about me to the boss and his wife, something really embarrassing and nasty comment obviously knowing I could hear him.

Ive never even spoke with him or done anything to offend him, how can one comprehend this kind of behaviour? Is it even explainable, hes not a moron or a teenager, an educated man. I dont get it?

I had another job and as a college student working around some lower education guys out of prison etc they say nasty stuff all the time but well i guess you just ''accept'' that as that is what ''they'' are most often like right?  Not that it excuses them but at least you can comprehend it to some degree i guess.

663,I'm scared of going back to school...,7,cfb7ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cfb7ft/im_scared_of_going_back_to_school/,6,1563589598.0,"Trigger Warning: Bullying, Depression

&#x200B;

First semester:

I've been bullied by a classmate for almost a year at this point. When I started (it was a new class and new school) last fall I thought this classmate to be one of my closest friends. I was so delighted to spend 3 years in the same class as one of my best friends. But as everything progressed, she ended up treating me like I was nothing. Long story short, she acted really off in the beginning and told me to spend time with other people, but when I started to actually spend time with others she started treating me really badly. She would come with really aggressive remarks and comments about my appearance, personality, humour, everything. I've been struggling with mental health issues for almost my entire life but at this point (fall/winter of 2018) I fell into the deepest depressive episode of my life. Her remarks made my confidence even worse. I hated myself, my body, my personality, because in my mind, one of my best friends thought all this was wrong with me. So it had to be that way.

&#x200B;

Second semester:

When I realised she treated me like that (this was something she did on a daily basis) because of jealousy and not feeling enough, I tried talking to her. She hadn't even looked at me for months, she always looked past me and never even said hi. Mind you, she knew about my really terrible depression but still decided to never even say hi, even though all her friends did. When we talked she told me she ""missed our friendship, at times"" and that ""I have so many other friends so she surely doesn't matter to me at all"". I would feel sympathy towards her, if I hadn't spent the whole first semester trying to talk to her, help her with her problems and give her everything I had. But it wasn't enough for her. I realised her behaviour was really toxic so I decided to block her. Of course she made a small fuzz about it so her friend group stopped talking to me completely. They didn't even look at me. I decided to talk to the counsellor, so we discussed everything us three. We made an agreement that me and the classmate always say hi to each other at least. Obviously, it didn't work out. When the school year ended she still wouldn't look at me and if I ever tried being nice to her she would always act really aggressive and as though she was somehow a victim.

&#x200B;

Feelings:

I almost never showed up to school the second semester because I was so afraid of how I would be treated. Every time I entered our classroom I felt so unwelcome and disliked by everyone. I have a few close friends from the class. But I ended up having to redo the year, so I'm redoing it after my summer break. I just don't know how I'm supposed to handle having lessons with the grade above (since I'm studying theatre, all the classes have lessons together from time to time), I don't know how I'm supposed to handle seeing everyone who've hurt and bullied me for another 2 years until they quit. Almost every single day. I had to go home from my town's Pride Parade this summer because it made me so sad just to see them.

&#x200B;

666,Teacher was a coward,6,cbyeup,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/cbyeup/teacher_was_a_coward/,6,1562894563.0,"*extra note: I have a learning disability, and when I learn something new, I take my time. Not only do I get much faster, but I learn to be fast and accurate, without cutting corners that would throw a patient's life in danger. I'm also not afraid to ask for feedback, and I've nevet let a defective product go without fixing or redoing the entire thing. I was IRONICALLY kicked out because they complained I was Slow. But they Joked with my classmates pricking their fingers and spreading their Blood into the patient's IV medication. I've never done this on real medication, because I care about the people I serve. Luckily, because I had such a good reputation for honesty and hardwork, a Supervisor at my student site had called the school that I needed to transfer to, and vouched for me, calling the other school out on their B.S. (He was also almost screwed over many years ago by the same school due to a car accident and a resulting severe medical injury, but he was a paralegal, and knew how to defend his rights.)*

I have a lot of social anxiety. But ironically I dont fear people that are bullies. Naturally, I get into conflicts with these nasty people all the time, because I look like an easy target, and when I fight back, people become afraid of me because I'm merciless and I do everything legally. I once had a great relationship with this teacher because I was doing very well in her class. However this girl kept picking on me throughout the year, and would sneakily say incredibly rude things to me just before acting like the class clown. This was her way of gaining self confidence, and establishing dominance over the classroom
So being the headstrong hot head I am, I confronted her while she was loudly cracking jokes at me in the middle of my teacher's lecture. My teacher pulls me aside, and I tell her how I've felt scared and upset because of that bully. But instead of trying to mediate, she expressed that she was afraid of losing control in the classroom. And told me: ""Who are you to place that higher standard on her?""
I was sent to the office, feeling Hurt and Betrayed. The vice principle tried to threaten to kick me out, and I said: ""IM SORRY IM WEIRD!""
I had informed my teacher many times prior about her actions. She always did nothing, and this bully kept getting worse. 
Now, the teacher openly started siding with the girl, confiding with her that she was going to impede my graduation, and my teacher then started making cruel jokes in class, and even labelling name calling me. 
I thought it would stop, I gave her 2 weeks, and I did nothing, and kept my head down and worked quietly. They did not stop: The bully kept telling everyone that: ""She was being nice to me so She wouldn't Get Shot."" 
The bystanders knew she was full of shit, but they did nothing. 
At the time, I saw our teacher as this perfect Immortal being that could do wrong, I did not see that she was a coward, I didnt realize she Needed the Bully to Feel in control. To me, I thought I was the bad guy, and I tried to do everything to mend our relationship to no avail. 
My grades and attendance started slipping because of the intensified bullying, my classmates started using the labels from my teacher. I had even brought back my 504 plan from high school. (But i found out later, when the school was trying to kick me out, that the guidance counselor hid the plan, and attempted to lie and tell everyone I had only given it to her that day). 
One day, the bully and I were alone in a room, and she patted me on the shoulder like a dog. I had enough. 

I sent my teacher a message and told her that I was terrified of going to class because the Bully had the Power to Control the entire classroom with Fear, and told them about the Dog Patting incident. 

The school did a lazy ""investigation."" Which was really just asking the bully if she did anything wrong to me. Of course she said no. 

So my teacher continued picking on me, and I kept trying to apologize to her, and the school administration kicked me out. Good grades, No Misconduct, nor documentation of any incident, just pure laziness on the school's part.

I still have feeling for the teacher. Not as much. I felt I had to tell this story because its exhausting and burdensome.

That's all I want to say. It's been a long battle, and in the end, I passed the only test that matters, and got into another program. I've learned my lesson: I will never accept unfair Blame, nor allow people to Shame me for Doing the Right thing."

Now 30 years later Clyde is in rehab, and I'm launching a new startup which happens to give services and create environments where there is much less bullying early on.

Clyde wasn't the only bully. Farther away from school in the richer neighborhoods where I lived I used to skateboard by myself. Most kids at that time skated and most were bullies, they wouldn't beat you up but they'd be as big of a jerk as possible. 

My words of advice for kids going through a hellish situation where they live is that there is hope, someday you could move somewhere there is less bullying. Can you imagine being able to transform your school and community so there was far less of that crap and people didn't cheer it on they'd refute it and resist it.

The teacher refuses to do anything about it because she and the student are friends, and the student keeps using the excuse that they’re the same race to avoid getting in trouble. She literally said “are you really gonna turn in one of your own for one of those ***?” The thing is, I’m not mad at her at all, and all of the shit I’m going through I probably deserve.

675,My experience with cyberbullying,7,bvsn48,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bvsn48/my_experience_with_cyberbullying/,0,1559470737.0,"To set the scene, I was young and had no friends (not the best kid, always kinda sensitive and cried alot, i dunno why, but comes into play later). I'm female but was scared of people being weird about my gender so I never really specified and on the server I played on they always just assumed, which was fine. I played on the server often and found a friend. Let's call this person B, of course for bully.

My main bad memories before the event were me making a build and he claimed it as his own, a bit of a douche move but young me thought nothing of it. He was actually ok at first, played, wasn't a bully. That's about where it ends. Once we found a good method of communication when not on minecraft, we began using that. It was convenient, but also around this time, he developed this persona to annoy me I guess. Me being sensitive, actually sorta started getting annoyed. I guess from then on he noticed I was the perfect victim.

Enter BP (bully's persona). He would act like a spoiled brat, make fun of everything I mention, including the fact I went to eat tomato soup for some reason (good tomato soup by the way), make a bunch of racist jokes (I didn't care about any of them, not even if they were directed at me in some way) and generally act like a douche. I didn't catch on that it was a persona cause I was dumb. This happened quite frequently. The main story, it's very messed up.

So I was on a server with this guy. We were havin a decent time, until a BP ""appears"". Starts their whole spiel. Except this time they call for their nonexistent mom. Let's call ""her"" BPM. BPM typed some stuff about how I was cyberbullying her ""son"" etc. I tried to explain to this ""woman"" and failed to (obviously) that ""her"" ""son"" was actually the first to throw stuff at me. None of it was being had, and they threatened to call their uncle who was in the FBI to come to my country and arrest me for cyberbullying. Now I look it seems ridiculous, but when in the moment, naive, and you don't know a lot on this kinda stuff, I began to frantically panic. Begging not to. All of that. Then suddenly B comes back and apparently gives his cousin money to resolve this situation. B says I owed him a lot. At this point I had gained enough composure to successfully sleep. But that's not all folks! The next day I just feel really uneasy, and by the time I go to school I was trembling, nervously. For the first 2 hours of school I'm in this panicked state of constant questions flooding my head. By the time we got on break, I was gaining composure, luckily. When I got home, I told people this, and there was this one guy who kinda laughed at the situation and told me the FBI has no authority in other countries. Thank you, guy, for that. If you read this, I still deeply appreciate you. That really comforted me and saved me from more nervousness.

This is not the only story, but the most memorable and the one that had side-effects beyond being upset. Thought I'd tell it because I guess it was about time I told someone. I'm feel like I'm about to get out of B's grasp soon enough since with my now slightly more developed brain I have noticed that he is kinda a jerk. I can't say this for everyone though, so stay safe out there everyone. Don't meet a B.

So now, I still unfortunately have to hang out with B, so he doesn't bully others, as he did for that time where I blocked him for 3 months. It's kinda worse, since due to me not taping my webcam they know I'm female now. Now they throw in sexist jokes, as well as the usual ""I hate you"" with a twist and the occasional death threat/family death threat. And that's about it I guess. Thanks for reading my story. I appreciate it.

He has a friend that calls him his “best friend” since kindergarten. The boy is super tall. In fact he gets mistaken for 7th graders. I am also really good friends with his dad. Since Kindergarten my son (who’s short and small for his age) has been complaining about this boy being very overbearing and somewhat of a bully.  During summer camp it got so bad my son was crying , wondering if he could get out of camp. The teacher at summer camp felt the same and specifically told me about his mood shifts when his friend arrived.  My son told me he is happiest when the boy was not around. Fast fwd 3 years later and my son is still complaining about the same issue. I asked why he is still hanging around him and he says sometimes he can be nice and jokes around. He’s funny but if he were to have a choice, he would rather not be friends with him at all. He’s scared of him. I asked him to switch friends and he says the boy stops him from playing with other friends or tells  other kids to treat him bad. So now he feels stuck with being with the same “gang “ of friends and the ring leader is his “best friend”. Apparently all the boys are afraid to cross him so they just do what he asks. One thing that my son refuses to do, are things that will get him in trouble. His bully friend often tries to get him into hot water by asking him to do stuff that would get him sent to the principals office but he does a good job of refusing. The funny thing in all this? The boy is actually ultra sensitive and can’t take other kids making fun of him despite his height. He often cries when some one calls him names and occasionally one of the taller kids in the group has karate chopped his throat which put him in tears(mind u he does not hesitate to tell the teacher when he gets  hurt, but blocks my sons path when my son tries to tell the teacher on him). His dad often tries to schedule a play date because he feels my son is a great influence but my son privately tells me he does not want any play dates with him because he is “rough” and beats up on him when no one is looking.  Mind u, my son has never come home hurt with a black eye or anything. One time he had a scratched nose because the kid dragged him through the wooden mulch. According to the other two friends my son hangs out with, hey have also told my son not do anything that would get him in trouble. They say he is just a bully. However most of the time they are not able to stand up to this kid and end up going along with him. I’m going to talk to the principal and let her know but for the last few years I have requested the principal to not allow the two boys to be in the same classroom as it is only adding more stress for my son.  I have asked my son to fight back but if he throws a punch I am sure he would complain to his dad and I will get a call .  I had a brief discussion with his dad on a previous incident and he found it hard to believe his son would do such a thing. That he considers my son his best friend and that kids have their own version of the truth. Go figure. At the end of the day, I want my boy to be independent and fight back and defend himself but I also have to protect his best interest. Looking for some advise."
680,There is this new type of pseudo-bullying that looks like acceptance.,6,bpmzq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bpmzq5/there_is_this_new_type_of_pseudobullying_that/,2,1558097752.0,"I used to be a victim of this kind of bullying. It could have been because I used to cry until I was 13 which made me look socially unacceptable. Others said it was because I acted weird (which even today I can't figure out why), but it could be because in freshman year of high school i tried to not talk to much in order to not seem annoying( i thought this because depression).

&#x200B;

Usually what happens in this type of bullying is that a kid who is unpopular or seems out of the ordinary or has some sort of disability becomes friends with popular kids. These popular kids may seem nice to him/her at first, but later they will gradually start using them as butts of all jokes, not inviting them to parties, snickering behind their backs. They will also clap whenever they do something mediocre.  To adults, the kids will pose as if they doing a good deed. Eventually these popular kids will solidify these kids as the butt of jokes. There is then only three ways the relationship can go, either the kid's mind goes into a mad frenzy as to whether the popular kids are their friends or not, does not question this at all(can't pick up on it), or just leaves the group.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm just trying to make people aware of this, as i've only heard about it recently online and before I thought I was just being crazy.

&#x200B;

To Parents, Educators and school officials:

When you see popular kids or other kids that seem pretty socially accepted introducing someone that would usually seem weird and something seems off in their interactions, don't just act passively. This might be happening."

He simply ignores everything. Since I have conscience, I forgave him. However that didn't fixed anything. Ok, back to the present.

Also yesterday, before watching Avengers: Endgame, we finally met with our online friend in personal, but odd enough, instead of the typical introduction of names, he made me look bad infront of our online friend, which annoyed me.

So this happened in 4th through 5th grade. My physical appearance wasn't bad ,but at the same time not good either. I met this kid (who we will call Tom) at the end of 4th grade.

At first he was nice , but each day he got worse. He made fun of my weight ,and intellect. It got to the point were I wouldn't eat ,and would try my hardest in every subject. Soon other of my "" friends"" starded joining in.

He started making fat jokes which he called them
(My name) jokes. He even went as far as to make fun of my disabled sister! I was to depressed to tell anyone ,even my parents. What made worst is that I was a transfer student from another school. So I knew no one ,and I trusted non of the teachers.

Now at the end of the year the grade level went on a field trip ,and we went to Dave and Busters. One thing to know about Tom was that he was a realy popular kid , and we had to be on groups. He wanted to get another ,but he was stuck with me. This is what he said.

Tom: "" your lucky to be in this group! "".

This realy hit deep. Not only was I not wanted ,but was forced to be their like I was a little brother.

At the end of the school year we were all sad because this was the last year before middle school (junior high). Everybody was sad except me. You know why these people were not real friends.

Don't worry my friend dated his crush who rejected him. All is well in the world."

I personally only have one friend that I can talk to about anything, and never made any friends in highschool. I've almost always felt insecure about something throughout my life, and I feel after starting my first year of college and making new friends, that I have been growing out of it.  I think the biggest problem I've had when making new friends is I'm always reserved when I first meet them, and as I grow more comfortable with them I become too abrasive. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've spent countless nights in bed trying to sleep but instead thinking of ways to better myself or fix any problems I've had.  I've started working out to look better for a girl, only to be too shy to talk to her when I had reached my goal. I've never been suicidal, but I have thought about what it would be like if I just died. I've thought maybe I'm just different.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I've been to school retreats where people get personal, I've seen the videos where people are honest about being unattractive and how they feel about being an outcast.

Maybe I can help you, and anyone else listening, the same way I've been helped before.

690,Mess with my friend? Let's fight.,6,b7w09b,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b7w09b/mess_with_my_friend_lets_fight/,1,1554113596.0,"Just saying I tried talking to my school counselor about these boys before this but they never believed me for whatever reason and after that, it actually made the situation worse. 

When I was younger there was this group of 5 or 6 boys who called themselves a gang. They loved messing with me. Their favorite nickname for me being 'Big Bertha' as I was a chubbier kid. I absolutely hated it. I became isolated and withdrawn and went from having lots of friends to only having 2. I was pretty scared of them so I never stood up for myself. I also hated going outside of my house as they hung out in my neighborhood. 

Somehow my best friend at the time convinced me to go sledding with her on a popular hill. We walked about 5 minutes to the hill and for an hour had a lot of fun. By the time we went to leave there was no one left around as it was going to get dark soon. Then we herd them. They yelled mean nicknames at me and did their normal thing. I was upset as they just ruined a fun day. Then the oldest one, 2 years older than us, started making fun of my friend. He slowly came closer to us. I snapped, I was fine with them making fun of me but not my friend. 

As soon as he came close enough I punched him as hard as I could in the jaw. He fought back, of course and I wish I could say I beat him up real good but I didn't. Since he was 12 and I was 10 he outpowered me as he was a lot bigger and got some good hits in but so did I. I ended up running off but I got the point across. The next day at school the same 'gang' of boys praised me for going up against a 7th grader. I guess the fighting method of getting rid of bullies really works as they never called me or my friend's names again.

It was kinda an overreaction to fight them but it had been happening for so long I had so much built up rage and hatred towards them. I was really protective of my friends and after that would stand up for other people I saw being bullied, I still do any chance I get. "
691,Years after bullying I'm still angry,7,b3j4tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b3j4tj/years_after_bullying_im_still_angry/,7,1553153311.0,"I was bullied a lot in middle school and I had a lot of different bullies, most of which bullied me on a consistent basis. But there was this one guy, let's call Harris, who was extremely popular and attractive. One day, Harris came up to me in gym class and said he liked me in front of everyone. I blushed and didn't say a word yet, because he hit me with the punchline right after. He said, ""April Fool's."" (It was April 1st) And then my heart sank and I heard a roar of laughter and snippets like, ""aw look she's blushing!"" ""How could she ever think he would like *her*"" 
Obviously the whole thing wrecked me. Honestly more than any of the other bullying and I've gotten over all the others, but I haven't been able to get over this one and I'm 19 now. I feel so much anger towards Harris and I think about revenge or confronting him, but I think both of those are not healthy at all. 
How do I get over this incident and this overwhelming anger?"
692,“Stop whistling!!”,7,b20ooa,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/b20ooa/stop_whistling/,0,1552819825.0,"Ok, so a little context before I start. 
I have this mental health disorder called Conversion Disorder. If you’ve ever heard of Tourettes then it’s basically the same thing it’s just not as extreme. 

Anyways, since I’m still in school I get stared at and laughed at. But this one time made me so sad/angry I actually almost started crying. So there is this kid (let’s call him JF for jerk face).
(This was when I had A TON of verbal tics) so one of my tics was whistling and clicking my tongue. And in this particular class of mine, I was the most stressed, and I really don’t know why. But anyways, I had the most tics in this class. So JF is sitting 2 seats in front of me and gets VERY annoyed VERY fast. So I was really ticcy that one day, and the class didn’t help much at all. So as you probably guessed, JF got ANNOYED and this is how it all went down:
JF-SHUT UP AND STOP WHISTLING!! (Yes he ACTUALLY said for me to SHUT UP)
ME-*completely frozen in shock*
TEACHER- (insert F-My friend) hey F, can you come over here please?


Now, I didn’t hear what the teacher told F, but this is what she told me
ME- (on the verge of yelling at the top of my lungs) soooo.....what did the teacher tell you 
F-she asked me who told ME to shut up and to stop whistling 


Now this made me ANGRY. The teacher did NOTHING to help me or even discipline JF. Also, during all of this the other people around me were yelling at JF saying that I couldn’t control it. AND I KID YOU NOT JF DID NOTHING TO EVEN SLIGHTLY APOLOGIZE TO ME.


Sadly, that’s how this story ended. I couldn’t do anything to stop it, and even after that, teachers STILL did nothing to either decrease my stress levels or even discipline anyone who laugh at me during the school day.

I’m now ok, the conversion disorder has faded away and I only have head movements, simple shoulder movements, and waving my hands. They now ONLY happen when I’m stressed, nervous, scared, or when I’m in big crowds for a long time.


And yes, JF is still in my class (he also got his NOSE BLOOD ON MY BACKPACK)

(I’m also in middle school, so people are JUDGY at my school. That really doesn’t help AT ALL)"

 He then proceeded to tell me how I was wrong and he was right. He publicly humiliated me in his class.

695,The time my teacher bullied me.,6,azq4ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/azq4ih/the_time_my_teacher_bullied_me/,1,1552315306.0,"

Back in 7th grade, around 2011, I was in the process of discovering who I was you know? I acted out a little bit but eventually I came to realize I was trying way too hard to gain attention from some females in my science class by being ignorant and interrupting the class. Smh. 


Anyways, I decided to get my shit together, stop neglecting my academics and become responsible and bring my books and shit to class. In between classes, we had about 2-3 mins to get to our next class. Mind you my school was a 1/4mile long hallway with my next class being at the end of that hallway. 
So I used to drop my book in front of my locker without opening it and start towards the gym, 
After that class I noticed my science book was gone. I couldn’t find it. I checked the L&F. Nothing. I said fuck it I’ll have to explain that I lost my book, and share my table partners. 


Fast forward a few months of using my table partners and getting my shit together, we had a new seating chart. I hated seating charts because for some fucking reason, i would be assigned to be in the back. I wore no type of glasses because I always broke them and I had not started wearing contacts yet, so I was visually impaired as fuck. So OF COURSE, my teacher saved me for last. So,Boom, she places me in the back but with no table partner.  I’m utterly confused I was isolated from everyone and there was an row of empty tables in front of me. She saved the back for me. Don’t know why but it did not dawn on me yet. She handed out the assignment for the class except me. She had “forgotten one”. I receive my paper and proceed to move up a table to use the closet tables book and she stops me and tells me to go back to my seat. I tried to argue with her but she interrupted me and repeated herself again. I sat down and I was just so confused like what the fuck is going on. 

After 10mins of me sitting there with my head in my hands, she approaches me and talks to me in a sarcastic sympathetic voice with a forced frown on her face saying “aw, looks like you don’t have a table partner to complete your work, huh? Looks like you’ll have to just fail the class?” She smiles and she walks away. 


I will never fucking forget that. This shit tore me apart. I wouldn’t lie about this shit to anyone or for upvotes, likes, retweets, etc. my whole life I thought we were supposed to look up to there people we call teachers. But instead they looked down on me and fucking taunted me when I was down. I might be over exaggerating in some people’s eyes, but this shit hurt me. I was chubby back then and People made fat jokes and I made them right back. I didn’t care. I wasn’t bullied by my peers but I was picked on by this fucking bitch for the whole year. She never moved me and I did end up failing.  If you read through this whole thing, you’re a kind soul, thanks. 😂"
696,Rumor,7,avh6r4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/avh6r4/rumor/,2,1551323830.0,"So a bit ago in one of my classes a girl that sat behind me
(We we're friendly and she was my best friends friend so I didn't expect it from her) but she spread a rumor that I gave the guy that sat next to me a handjob IN class. (Which is fucking ridiculous but I guess it's believable in my school) I wasn't aware that people we're making fun of me and shit because I was innocently doing school work. The next day was pretty much one of the worst days of my life. I had hundreds of eyes on me when I walked around campus. People we're talking in their friend groups and pointing at me and people I knew avoided me. Then when I went into that class my teacher screamed my name then made me sit outside in the rain for 30 minutes. Then she told me about the rumor and I broke down crying. She was just like aw kids are cruel and sent me to the principals office. Then I had to talk to a bunch of school staff and none of them believed me. Why would they anyway? Since they had no proof I couldn't get suspended or anything so eventually I got sent back to class. Where I had to sit next to the guy and had to deal with the humiliation and eyes on me. People would make handjob gestures at me and nobody wanted to sit next to me  in classes. Then to make my life better my best friend who I thought I could trust ended up stabbing me in  the back and started making fun of me with other people in  class as if I couldn't hear her.  So now I now spend my lunches alone in an isolated part of my school. I just feel so injusticed because the guy didn't have to deal with ANYTHING. No office visits, no bulling, nothing. And I hate that so much. Not that I want him to get in trouble it's just really unfair. And I don't want to make it a gender thing but I feel like it's because I'm the girl in the situation.. I made Instagram posts calling her out on her likes but it made the situation a lot worse. "

You wouldn't think that if you spoke to me. I talk considerably well. I also have a lot of Caucasian friends. Even my current partner is white. People in my community, my school, even my own family bully me for it. I never felt comfortable in my skin because people always would pick on me calling me a ""wanna-be whit b\*tch"" and that made me upset. it still makes me upset to be honest. to make matters worse I feel so scared to the point where I don't want my family to meet my boyfriend because they are blatantly racist and rude at times. I try to laugh off the joke but it hurts me deeply.

&#x200B;

when I was little I was in foster care raised by people who talked a certain way. their way of talking rubbed off on me. I can't help it. Then when I was little I was racially confused because of my white foster parents and I being black. It hurts so bad and I want it all to stop but it doesn't. At school girls constantly want to fight me because they way I talk I guess makes them think that i think i'm better.  I got Jumped by my peers because they hated they way I talked/act and i'm shunned by my own family for the way I talk/act. At times its hard to deal with. I can't just change myself. trust me I have tried. Can someone help me?"

I knew that for a few years, but I didn't have the guts to confront her cause she could very easily influence everyone's opinion of me and I'd end up being the bad guy of this situation. Now that I'm out of highschool and my social circle is practically non existent I'm thinking of confronting her, but I'm scared she may influence the opinion of other people that I could potentially have to interact with in the future, since she is really fucking popular.

I go to a private school with only 15 boys in my grade. They are all asses and pick on me. I hate it.  The one girl I was gonna ask got some guy from Portugal to go with her. The other girl I was gonna ask is out of school but the boys in my grade hate her and she also lied to get out of my sister's wedding, said she was out of town but saw pics of her with her sister at their home  on instagram(her sister's in my grade). I don't know what to do even if I go alone I'll still get picked on and bullied. Im just not going to go. 

Pls tell me what you think. I feel better that I finally told someone this.

Update: so this one guy in my grades gf's best friend wants to go and he told me I should ask her but as you know i dont even want 2 go. The guy asked that girl even though i told him not to. (I haven't told anyone about not going because that would open a floodgate of insults and bulling) The guy told me after school today that that girl said yes.(i hope he lied to me as a joke) I'm really upset now. From what i know of that girl she posts things that belong in r/im14andthisisdeep and that she is really liked by people of the lower grades in my school which means the girls in the school will bully me behind my back if I say no.

A lot of things happened but now it’s just so ridiculous I am lost, dunno if I should cry or laugh or what. I have to share this with someone.

So I do photography, and other students and teachers think my photographs and the book presentation is good, and also that I meet the necessary criteria to have a good grade, but my photography teacher is the only one who doesn’t, and when I ask her why she never gives me an answer, avoiding it. She claims that my project is bad because I don’t take her advice, when, I’m fact, I do. Rewriting critiques, taking more pictures, changing my themes just to suit her whims, but in the end she isn’t satisfied. Before the Christmas break she checked our books according to some marking table we have, she gave me 4/25 for my development and that my over all idea was lame (I wonder why she didn’t say a thing earlier, when I would actually have enough time to fix everything). So since it’s that bad I had to change the topic completely over Christmas and I have almost 300 new pictures that I managed to take just for this new project. I brought the new book in and what I get is her looking at it like she was looking at a cockroach, really, she didn’t say a thing at first and just claimed she never gave me that and she wants me to go back to my old project.
Now, I did not do anything over Christmas for that project because, well, it was abandoned, and I have less than two weeks until the project deadline. I know it’s going to be impossible to finish it because next week we have mock exams and I have to focus on that, but she just says that I have to go back to the old one. 
Why? Because she said so. 
I told her I simply won’t manage and she took that as an insult. Me having an attitude and being rude to a teacher, and so soon I’m supposed to have a chat with our head teacher who genuinely thinks that it’s never, NEVER, the fault of a teacher and it’s always the student’s fault.

So here I am, almost midnight, writing on Reddit because I just don’t know what to do. Oh and also a note, our Photography projects are NOT market by the teacher, we have an examiner come in for a few days and mark them without even interacting with the teacher, so it’s not really about making it as she wants because she’s not the one marking...

I did have homophobic feelings, but I never would be mean to others to cover it up. It was more of me agreeing that homosexuality was weird or against God. Thankfully, that did not last long, but I am sad that it still exists. Being much older now and seeing the evolution of acceptance in the world, I did not expect the same thing to be happening almost 20 years later, especially so obnoxiously in public. 

I was never good with bullies and was often seen as weak or soft, along with not being able to respond in a way that would show that I could stand up for myself. I hope this is the right sub for this, and am just looking for opinions and critique of how I handled the situation tonight. Did I do the right things? What could I do better or do next time?

Here is what happened:

I was at the mall with my girlfriend today, and I decided to go into the arcade to play some 90s pinball machines for nostalgia and fun. Two kids came in who might have been 9-11, and he asked me if a broken down machine was working. A few minutes later, a pack of 6 or 7 kids from ages 12-15 came in, and they started to lounge and take over three games in the corner. I heard one of the younger kids start calling the younger one a lesbian, gay, and other things. The bully started to say things like, “I am not gay. I am straight as fuck!“, along with trying to start a fight with others. I stopped, looked around, and glared at the bully. Then my girlfriend said out loud that if you have to say you have to confirm you are straight, it might not be the case.  After that, I went over to the bullied kid, asked him if he was being teased, and then told him that they are just mean and assholes (I know that was not the best term, but I was shaking in anger.) After that, I got $5 in quarters, gave him some, and told him to have fun. I thought they would lay off of him if they thought that he was with me, and it would also make him feel better.

The weird part is is that there was clearly an older brother in the group, and he moved across the room and looked embarrassed with an awkward smile. I know a bit how bullies work for the most part, and there is a part of me that feels bad for him for needing to show dominance to strangers and find weakness in others to cover up his own insecurities. I just have no idea what to say or do sometimes, especially something I have not experienced in so long.  I really do not want to be that adult who scorns kids who are lost, ultimately making them feel worse about themselves. 

Also, this arcade had no staff, and I would have definitely  went that route if there was a worker.

705,"From this post, why does it sound I’ve been bullied to the degree I have?",5,aaf428,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/aaf428/from_this_post_why_does_it_sound_ive_been_bullied/,2,1546065028.0,"So, let me start by saying that I do not necessarily intend to sound like the victim in my post. But, I’m rather skeptical as to why I’ve experienced this amount of dislike in my life. 

I’m 24. Used to be a heavy child. I’m still considered overweight to the BMI chart, but I’m 80 lbs lighter and most of my weight is in my legs. I was bullied worst as a middle schooler by girls ALL the boys like and they were pretty! I finally stood up for myself and that made things worse. Flash forward to high school, I had a significant amount of relatively slim white female “friends” that used to make sideways comments and did not have my best interest at heart.

The most recent experience I had was when I worked at a car dealership 2 years ago as an admin assistant and the cashier threatened and did petty shit to me to make the work place difficult to cope with. Not to mention, her small female posse used to gossip about me, including some of the male mechanics. I was chunkier at the time, that’s the only reason I’d think something was off in how I was viewed. 

But even at my smallest weight, I was mistreated by women at the previous job I had in retail. So I don’t know if it is primarily based on my appearance. I’ve been told I come across as unapproachable, shy,stuck-up, unfriendly etc. Ive become relatively anxious towards people in my life. That’s why I’m so reserved. I don’t know if I’m misunderstood or if there is something wrong with my personality unknowingly. Not to mention, I have drama with my aunt, grandmother, female cousin and I don’t talk to my father at the moment because of his bipolar behavior.  

I can understand why my grandmother would think I’m disrespectful and my fathers issue  is understood. But my aunt HATES my mother and I. The terrible things she said to me
and has gossiped behind my back. Men are rude too at times, the ones that don’t get the preferred response from me. Am I just unlucky or is there something I’m missing?"

The kids were picking on me because I was taller than all of my classmates I went through puberty earlier than all of them. Especially 2 girls who used to be best friends. They both bullied me almost everyday at school.  One of them was jealous of me the most because she would always say to me “Omg you’re so lucky that you’re tall!” but I didn’t like it (I know it’s a compliment but it made me feel very uncomfortable.) I was about 5 feet tall when I was 10 now I am 5’6 and all the boys from my 5th grade class are all taller than me now.  One of the girls said to me “I would tie your braids up on a tree.” she also didn’t like my braids and the other girl who bullied me was such a narcissist! she doesn’t really care about anyone but herself. Me and the other kids in my 5th grade class would always get into arguments about everything. PE was the worst subject in school they would always criticize me if I did something wrong and especially one of the girls who horribly bullied me. I am currently living in Florida now and I’ve been living here for 9 years and I feel so grateful I don’t live in that s***hole city anymore.

To this day, the 5th grade bullying constantly haunts me. Everyone thinks I’m psychotic because I obsess about it too much and I don’t know what to do.

The girls who bullied me back in 5th grade have been fined for their behavior. My mom found this lawsuit called Cooper and Zeaker last month and sued them.

The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Bullying can happen to almost everyone to the mean girls in school to the traditional bully wanting lunch money. “Physical bullying declines with age, while verbal, social, and cyber bullying tend to increase between the ages of 11 and 15. Bullying tends to be a peak in the 9th grade with the school transition”(U.S. Department of Health And Human Services).  There are two different types of aspects that are seen it bullying victims. There are physical and emotional aspects of bullying are often seen. Bullying can and will be stopped by the students being bullied. Bullying causes emotional and physical distress that lasts a lifetime. One thing to draw attention to is the awareness of bullying in school and the characteristics that surround bullying.

Imagine yourself in a room of darkness, alone and sad, having fears about life. Imagine being alone in a room full of people not finding a friend feeling like there is no one left in the world who understands you. Imagine being an outsider and being tortured to the point of suicide. Imagine the sad, emotional depression that is inside one’s heart in all aspects of their life. The feeling of being alone and the fear that no one can help is demoralizing and degrading. This sense of depression is all too real for some and for others a reality that cannot be taken away. This depression is caused by bullying in middle school students or high school students and is most prominent in students who stand out and have difficulties making friends. Too many times people face bullies and can’t stand up for themselves. According to Ross Rocha, Physical Education teacher at Bishop LeBlond high school and a bachelor of sports psychology, stated, “men typically are seen as the physical abusers that pick on the physical attributes of other students that seem weak. The abusers or bullies try to fit in with their peers by picking on students that are seen as inferior or different to appease a superior member in a group.” The group mentality in men is very common and can be seen at all ages. These characteristics of grouping up and finding things in common relate to the very nature of human nature. At times as you see here can backfire and can lead to bullying if not stopped. 

Since the 2016 Election, more and more people have been bullied. Chris Sommerfeldt writer for NY Daily News wrote that “the Human Rights Campaign interviewed more than 50,000 Americans between the ages of 13 and 18 and found that 70% of respondents have witnessed bullying, hate speech, or harassment since the onset of the campaign season, with racial prejudice being the most common motive.” There has been a spike in bullying from 2016, this might be students putting pressure upon one another for dominance or having some type of prejudice against one another. Bullying can be prevented, through the action of parents and students alike bullying can stop. As Kimberly Huss, Vice Principal at Bishop Leblond and Head Volleyball Coach, stated, “ as soon as bullying is seen as serious someone like a teacher or faculty member need to step in and prevent more incidents of bullying.”  Check in with kids often. Listen to them. Know their friends, ask about school, and understand their concerns. The life of a bully is at times difficult and at times unfortunate. Julia Marie Cooper, writer of Bullying: A performance piece addressing emotional and verbal abuse between children said that “hyperactivity and impulsiveness are more likely to become bullies. This includes problems holding still and doing things without thinking.” 

Rebecca Fraser-Thill writer of Characteristics of the Typical Victim of Bullying, states that “children who act submissively and anxiously are more likely to be bullied than children who do not have those tendencies. In fact, some researchers believe that a child's lack of assertiveness and security may serve as a cue to bullies that the child is a ‘perfect victim.’” The personality of a student directly influences the way a bully interacts with that student. From the physical characteristics of being bruised and having broken bone to the emotional characteristics of being lonely. Bullying is a problem in schools and most prominent in high school. A high school is a place where students are trying to find themselves and for the most part, this is great. For some high school students, this is dangerous and scary because these students are often small, weak, awkward, or are seen as too smart. Haryana Hisar, an Independent Researcher of Psychology at the Indian Association of Health, wrote “ girls tend to organize their bullying in a more social manner, around rumor spreading and manipulation of friendships, while boys exhibit more physically aggressive activities (verbal abuse, physical attacks,&threats.)” Many of the bullying seen is physical and the outward appearance is prominently shown but one of the most dangerous signs of bullying is the emotional stress put on students.

The fear of bullies is too emotional for some and others too much real. According to Jill Weber, Ph.D. and writer for Healthy Living Magazine, states, “boys and girls bully, but research shows girls are much more likely than boys to use indirect or relational aggression.” Women are more likely to punish one’s reputation by spreading gossip and turning on friends to get a attention or becoming more popular. This same thing can be seen in men but less to a certain degree. The male perspective is to be violent and abrasive to get attention and to gain friends. Many times bullies are trying to fit in and have a place in a group. According to Justin Grove, a Theology teacher at Bishop LeBlond highschool and graduate from Oxford, stated: “bullies tend to find ways to bring people down in a social status to make themselves feel better and to get high in their own group.” Which two cause the most damage? The physical damage is temporary but can leave scars in one’s skin and in one’s mind. The emotional and phycological damage changes one’s personality and as a result are not as outgoing. Many times people forget about the weaker or ‘weird’ students and in turn don’t care if they get bullied or abused. The cycle of the bully and being bullied is continuous until the cycle can be stopped by an outsider, a hero.

Students that are bullied are outcasts from the very second they step into the classroom. At times these students are nerds or geeks that don’t fit in with the jocks and popular groups. They tend to be secluded, talking to students that have a similar nature and that participate in similar activities from glee club to theater to band. The bullied tend to have more abuse psychologically or emotionally than physically. Research by the Secret Service and the U.S. Department of Education involving 37 school shootings, including Columbine, finds that “about two-thirds of student shooters felt bullied, harassed, threatened or injured by others.” Most school bullying cases do not lead to school shootings, but bullying is a serious and more common problem than previously recognized that can leave emotional wounds long after the physical wounds have healed. Being bullied results in depression and loneliness that takes its toll on a person. This can lead to suicide and worse school shooting just because a student decided to abuse their power and social status.

Schools have high bullying rates due to the number of different personalities and different interests. The bullying outbreak has been in human society from the time competition has been schools, but bullying has become more prevalent in the modern age. The wanting of success in school develops competition, which in turn create jealousy and disappointment. The loss in the connection between social groups like, the isolate and friendless kid, and the popular kid, create conflicts and produces spaces that exclude certain ideology and personality. ""From a very young age, children are inadvertently conditioned to believe this ideology as a way to get ahead especially once the child enters elementary school,"" said Patricia Bolton Allanson, College of General Studies teacher at Liberty University. 

Why do bullies act the way they do? Bullies are often misunderstood and not treated properly, causing them to lash out on others. Bullies tend to have a lower IQ, lack empathy, are impulsive, aggressive, antisocial, and cannot understand how their actions hurt others. Why then do bullies pick on others, can’t bullies have friends that help and keep them successful?  Well, bullies tend to pick on their prey very selectively. Their victims tend to be students that have an antisocial behavior or a behavior that would normally exclude them from activities, this can be from not playing a sport to not playing video games. Bullies tend to be the ones trying to fit in and those students that have trouble communicating with others. Another reason for the way bullies acts the way they do is that there might be a disturbance in their home life from abuse to an inadequate amount of food leaving these bullies hungry. This, in turn, makes bullies strike out in anger for food taking student’s lunch money or picking on students for doing well in school. 

School is supposed to be a place of learning and a place of security. When students refuse to go to school just because they are afraid of being beaten up or verbally abused the school is no longer safe. I learned throughout this endeavor that being a bully is natural but a set of circumstances that influence the bully. In turn, the bullied is the punishing bag for all the abuse or misfortune that the bully has. A bully needs to put people down to make himself taller. Find help if anyone has symptoms of being a bully or being bullied. Please tell someone because without an outsider’s help the cycle of being bullied will never stop.

Let´s go with standard bullying definition as a specific type of goal-directed aggression, encompasses both direct physical and verbal behaviors (e.g., hitting, name calling), as well as more indirect manifestations such as group exclusion. There is overwhelmingly huge body of literature proving bullying prevention in school represent a very important subject. Giving reasons for emerge of phenomena, I personally lean toward the explanation of attempt to gain a powerful position in the peer group (check this out for some evidence Olthof et al. 2011). Being bully, you can be almost sure you stacking up into your ""later-life treasure box"" factor for criminal offending (Ttofi et al. 2011), key risk marker for anti-social behaviour (Bender & Losel, 2011), greater chances for depressive and anxiety disorders (Sourander et al. 2007) etc.

How it is for victims? Well, **it sucks a big time** to be bullied and everybody who experienced that can confirm. But these experiences can be also beneficiary in a long term. Really?

Yeah, it´s possible, eg.  experience of bullying develops your cognitive ability for forgiveness (Egan & Todorov, 2009). Among other important personal characteristics which may be developed by tough social background, you can look at the question from the other side. How would your life look if you would be raised in over-protecting social structure where you never have to copy with any social problems whatsoever? You surely know some people who did which enables to do to comparison.

My question is: *Do you think being a bully victim made you stronger (/better) person? How?*"

This girl who used to be my friend and used to be really nice. She left for about two years which broke my heart. We used to be best friends. Anyway, when she came back she'd changed. She was horrible with a horrible attitude and was a compulsive liar. After about a year and a half, she left, but not before ruing my life. She tore apart my friendships and every time we had a fight, she'd make me feel extremely guilty. After she left, I felt some relief, but still had fights with this one girl who used to be my best friend until that manipulator came along and told her lies about me. Yesterday, I found out that she's going around to all my friends and telling them all not to hang out with me because I'm manipulative and a liar and a slut. I'm literally crying while writing this because it's happened before with that other girl and now, when I thought people were starting to like me and when I was starting to make friends again, it's all gone and I'm alone again. It's terrible and I don't know what to do! To top it all up, there's this one girl in my class who keeps saying that I sit alone because it's my choice and I victimize myself... why anyone would do that is beyond me, but she thinks that my life's not all that bad.

In high school, I took AP psychology. I never really excelled in that class, partially due to not preparing. The teacher likes to do this exercise where a student would go to the front of the class and answer a question. If you got it wrong, you got a point off (you would have 10 points for the week and could gain or lose through various ways. These points then are turned into a grade). After your turn, you pick another student. 

Well, I got picked a couple turns in. Naturally, I didn’t know the answer. -1 point. I choose another student. They answer, then pick me. I don’t know the answer so -1 point. This kept repeating. Every other person called on me. They knew that I didn’t know the answers and would lose points, but they still called on me. The teacher did absolutely nothing. 

At the end, I don’t know how many points I lost because all I could think about was how my classmates singled me out, caused me to lose a letter grade and the teacher stood by and let it happen. 

I was humiliated and embarrassed. "
716,workplace bully,7,9q173a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9q173a/workplace_bully/,3,1540128744.0,"I work in a restaurant as a greeter. I understand that that puts me somewhat on the bottom of the totem pole because my job is relatively easy compared to the servers', but I've been there for a year and I do a good job balancing seating and guest demand.

One of the servers has a bad attitude. Every day he comes up to check on reservations by asking, ""Anything going to make me hate my life?"" If he gets a big party or a demanding party, he'll come up to me, give me the stink eye and angrily ask me why I sat them in his section. It's nothing personal. Sometimes it's just the best option for the flow of the restaurant. And there's no way I can know guests' personalities when they walk in. He'll give me the stink eye for the rest of the night any time I walk past him.

He'll come up an complain about how horrible his guests are and how he hopes they go to hell and that he gets to be the one to torture them. I understand sometimes guests are obnoxious, but again, it's not my fault.

Today he came in for his shift and told me and some other servers, ""You all are lucky I need this job because I thought about not coming in today."" Which, again I understand not wanting to come into work, but it's not our fault, nor our luck that you showed up to work.

Tonight's dinner shift was busier than expected, and I was having to scramble to get a table for a 5-top. I started to get a table ready for them in his section, and he stopped the other greeter and said, ""If you give me a 5-top I will come up there and have words for you and they won't be nice."" 

I don't know. I understand everyone was stressed out because the kitchen was behind, but he was the only one with a table available at that time. I wasn't doing anything I hadn't done before and that my boss would have said no to.

I also understand that the restaurant business tends to be a little rough and getting cussed out is kind of expected... but I guess in a way it'd be more understandable if it was coming from a superior and not just a co-worker. I think I'm just an easy target.

Anyway, it's just frustrating how negative he is and how in times of high stress that translates into him coming down on me as though I'm causing it, and then tonight sort of threatening the consequence of getting cussed out if I don't bend to his will.

I don't think my case is strong enough to go to my boss. I think it could be considered really subtle intimidation, but in the restaurant industry, it's nothing. 

I guess my plan is to just not react and to be kind for as long as I can and to stick up for my decisions.

So idk, I just wanted to get it all out. Thanks if you read this."

Bullying started full force in sixth grade. Most of it came from one of my peers. She told me I was worthless, a waste of space, disgusting, a waste of life, better off dead, bound to die alone and loveless, annoying, unlikeable, unloveable, stupid, etc... She also used to out anyone she so much as thought was LGBT because it meant she had some kind of power over them. She nearly cost me some people I held very dear at the time. Nearly cost them their lives. Never once did she show remorse, and she's the only person I have ever met whom I believe to be truly evil. 

The thing is, she's gone on to become a pop star. Or a rising pop star. People are calling her an LGBT role model and a role model in general and no one knows what she's really like, what she did to people she thought were beneath her. I don't know if I can say she was solely responsible for the broken feeling I carry with me, but I know she did more damage than anyone I have ever met in the nine years since I first encountered her torment and cruelty. It makes me feel sick and helpless that people who are the same age I was when she bullied me now look up to her as an icon and an example of what they should be like. People almost died because of the way she treated them. I almost died because of the way she treated me. And here I am, lost, scared, depressed, and anxious. I was starting to forget when someone brought up her name in casual conversation, not even aware that I knew her. That was a few months ago. Now I'm having recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks and those horrible stretches of depression she helped kick into gear years ago. "

721,Coming to terms,6,9a0wkp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9a0wkp/coming_to_terms/,7,1535171423.0,"When I was around 4 I began being bullied. One boy in my year would call me names, kick, hit me and would always make me play the monster or bad guy if he let me play with him and his friends.

When I was 6 I wet myself during a test because my teacher wouldn't let me go to the toilet. This was a source of bullying up until I was 15 by so many different classmates.

When I was 8 I got called a bitch by a classmate (I had no idea what that was at the time). Other names I got called during the entire time I got bullied include: crybaby, freak, bodrick, whore, medusa, slut, psychopath.

Also at age 8 I lost my best friend because she picked on me for having a my little pony poster in my bedroom. She told the whole class so they all picked on me.

People have always given me looks that scream ""i think you are insane"".

I have been punched kicked. I was backed into a holly bush by 5 boys when I was around 9.

At 8 or 9 I took a day off school as I was ill. The next day I came back and there was a new girl. She hated me because people had told her loads of horrible things about me. No matter how kind I tried to be for the next 2 years she never liked me.

When I was 9 I received possibly my first death threats by a boy in the year above. He would also sometimes chase me round the playground with a sharpened piece of wood, trying to stab me.

I would constantly leave the class to cry when I was 10 and started thinking about killing myself when I was 11.

On my 11th birthday my friend gave me a couple of mints. Some other students saw and told the dinner lady on me as sweets were not allowed. I think they were thrown in the bin.

When I was 12 a boy who got the same bus as me would threaten to kill me. He would grab my throat and strangle me. He would tell me exactly how he'd kill me.

When I was 14 my friends would steal my belongings and throw them round the class and hide them from me. They would say things to make me uncomfortable like asking if I had started my period which they knew I hadn't.

When I was 17 my ex's best friend would consistently call me a psychopath (possibly due to his knowing I had depression). He would hit me and embarrass me in front of the whole friend group.

Last year a couple of people told me that my hamster would die in 2 days of me getting it because I named her Tofu. They bet on how soon she'd die. They told me they knew where I lived and would come and kill her.

This isn't everything. I've buried a lot of it I think. I have moderate depression and generalised and social anxiety. I think it's caused by the bullying. I think it's kind of stupid because it's just bullying but there were so many people over so many years it really got to me. I still believe I'm a freak. I struggle to think that anybody might like me or actually love me. If a couple of people are laughing I often think they are laughing at me or talking about me."

724,Stories of bullies younger than me,7,93j3a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/93j3a9/stories_of_bullies_younger_than_me/,2,1533104559.0,"Hello everyone. First time poster and new lurker on this subreddit.

I have been bullied by younger people when I was a school. I was always so embarrassed by it because as an older person, you're meant to seem like the bigger one and be able to defend yourself. If I ever told anyone at school (like class mates) I got bullied by younger people, they would probably laugh. 

I always stood out as a vulnerable person at school. I never stuck up for myself and secondary school was probably the worse time, but also the best time of my life? Sounds crazy, I know. I made so many memories in my drama class with my class mates, it was so fun. Then again, I’m only 19 years old, I’m sure I have more good things coming my way.

Here in the UK, we have 4 stages of school. Nursery/preschool, infant school, junior school and secondary school. (Not really sure if nursery/preschool counts, but I’ve included it anyway.) When you start secondary school in year 7, you’re the youngest out of everyone in the entire school. So if someone older bullied you, it didn’t seem as bad as someone younger bullying someone older than you.

My first lot of bullying happened when I was in year 8. (I was like 12 or 13 at the time) and it was a new term and new start. The year 7s had just started school, (Year 7s are aged between 11 and 12 years old) it was a rainy day and people were playing football in the playground. I don’t exactly remember what happened, but this year 7 kid did something that I didn’t approve of. I decided to say something to him and he called me a name. I can’t remember what he said because this was 6 years ago.

I then once got sent to a detention room because I did something bad. He was in there. I thought to myself “He can’t be nasty to me because there’s a teacher in here.” I was wrong. I think the teacher had said to him to go and get some paper, so he did. Whilst bringing the paper back to his desk, he hit me on the head with the paper and said something. I think the other people in there were laughing at what he did.

Thankfully however, his name calling did stop after a while and no teachers had to intervene. 

So when I came into year 9, there was this year 7 who caused a lot of problems for me. He was a horrible little shit. I still see him sometimes now, but thankfully he doesn’t say anything to me because I told my sister. I’ll get to how it stopped soon.

We were all in assembly (an assembly is a school gathering where the school all comes together and give information and talks about things. I hated assemblies with a passion) and someone had farted. I’d obviously breathed in, like humans do and happened to smell this horrible odour. I said to my friend, “can you smell that?” The year 7 was looking at me whilst I said that and he was smiling. He then proceeded to copy what I said and said it to his friend. He then looked at me and said, it was me who farted. I was completely shocked by this. I hadn’t done anything of that nature. I thought it was something that he’d easily forget. He didn’t forget that anytime soon.

So one day I was walking down the hallway of the school and he said to his friend, “she was the one who farted!” I got really angry at this and decided to hit him around the head, hard. I thought violence was the answer. But it wasn’t. 

At lunch time, it’s always so busy. Massive long queues and lots of people pushing in to get their food first. (I was guilty of doing this too) I had got my lunch, the usual thing. And out of nowhere I felt someone hit the back of my head. It was that little shit. I looked behind me and saw him look back and he had ran away. I had a headache all afternoon because of him.

I had to tell the teacher off him, he just wouldn’t leave me alone. He was always so abusive. This didn’t work though. Throughout the year, I had told off him several times and nothing had stopped him. The teacher I told was useless towards the end of my school life anyways. I’ll get onto that in a minute. 

I was walking home, as fast as I could because people were so mean at my school. He wasn’t in his school uniform because he had been expelled because of whatever reasons. I walked past him and he called me the n word in front of all his mates. (I’m not black, I’m not sure why he’d call me that) That was it, I had enough. I had decided to tell my sister. My sister was very popular at school and not to be messed with. She never bullied anyone. She was the popular type and everyone in her year knew of her and me. That’s probably why people her age never really bullied me... that much. Anyways, I told my sister. As an older sibling, she was not happy by this. She immediately asked me his name and I told her. She looked him up on Facebook and messaged him. Needless to say he never said anything to me again! I should have went to my sister the whole time! I still see him sometimes and I’m still nervous of him. I have to remember though, it wasn’t me who started this. (I know I hit him, but I thought it would stop.)

I’m not sure how the third lot of bullying started, but I know for sure I didn’t start on this year 8/9 when I was in year 10.  

Now when you’re in year 10/11, you start sitting your GCSEs. GCSEs are qualifications that you’re meant to leave school with to progress onto doing a course at college. When I was in year 10 and 11. I was allowed to skip certain classes and focus on my other GCSE classes. The teachers were fine with this.

So at my school, there was 3 art classes. Two on one side and one in the middle of the other two. The one in the middle of the other two was never in use for classes, so GCSE students were allowed to sit in there and do work whilst the teacher was teaching other students.

One day it was home time and I needed to put something away or I needed to speak to the teacher, one of the two. And this kid comes up to me whilst I was waiting and saids, “why are you in here?” I don’t think I answered him because I didn’t want to. I had a water bottle in my hand and he then slapped it out of my hand and said something like, “get out of here!” His classmates laughed. 

I then proceeded to cry and went to a teacher. This was the one I was talking about earlier, towards the end of my school life, she was useless and didn’t even bother to tell him off. I think he did eventually stop, but I was still scared of seeing him.

Recently I went to a college introduction. Now, I’m 19 years old and most of the other students there were 16 years or older. We got paired into partners and had to complete this task. This one boy didn’t have a partner, so the teacher asked if me and this other girl could let him in our group. We kindly said yes.

We had to an “interview” with each other. I interviewed this girl, she interviewed that boy and that boy interviewed me. After the interview (it was just asking questions about ourselves) we had to draw what we may look like from just words. I didn’t know what to draw, so I drew a cartoon picture of the girl I interviewed. He then proceeded to draw a horrible picture of me. When I said horrible, I mean horrible. He was saying stuff like “I’m going to draw you with big eyes.” At first it was a joke, but then he took it too far. He drew me in an ugly manner and all the girls were laughing near us. I tried to hold it in and smiled, pretending I was OK. I wasn’t though. 

I went to the teacher and said if I could have a word with her, she said that was fine. Before she came over to speak to me, I basically hid myself and cried. He had humiliated me so badly. A stupid 16 year old had took the mick out of me. What a bad event before college has even started.  The teacher then said “I didn’t know it made you feel that way?” Yer, because a purposely bad drawing of me is going to make me feel happy?  I then got to sit out from the rest of the group and did my art thing alone with a learning support teacher. The main teacher then made me join everyone else again. I was embarrassed to join the group again because I thought people might have noticed I was gone and that I had cried. 

He then continued to show off his creation of me. He had made a horrible statue of me. People laughed. I laughed because I didn’t want to cry again. 

And that’s some bullying stories of mine! These are all true and they all did happen. It was kind of hard writing this because it was like reliving those horrible memories. They’re all in the past now though. 
Moral of the stories: Never be violent, it will back fire. And remember, bullying is bullying, no matter what the age. You could be 30 years old and have a 15 year old child bully you. Bullying is a form of abuse. DO NOT EVER TOLERATE BULLYING.

Now I’m Normal and am not annoying. My friends now always made fun of me and make jokes about me jnfront of other people and even just us. They’ll tell me to shut up infront of people. I feel super annoyed and it’s like I’m always the last option. Some guys hate me for no reason. I don’t talk to them or do anything that would make them hate me. The main one will call me ugly and annoying and stupid and tell me to leave and just tell me to leave over and over and i don’t really say anything bc I’m kind of out on the spot so I just say stuff like I’m gonna and lol k and other guys will say stuff like no one likes you not even your friends and my friends won’t say anything usually and rarely defend me they hang around the guys. I will just be sitting there and the guys will yell at me. I’ve developed major anxiety and get anxious if I have to ride the transit with the boys and try to find a way out and I tdy to miss extracurricular if the guys are there. My friends are popular and we r all best friends but I feel like I’m just a burden and the other guys don’t usually stop it I’m friends with the majority of guys and normally they’ll just be like are u tryna make her cry or laugh. I feel like by yelling back or a comeback he’ll/they’ll escalate it so I usually pretend like I don’t care and when the other guys say that the main guys keep calling me ugly and I’ve been told like 6 times this year to just kill myself. I honestly don’t do anything And anything I do do other people do and people laugh and talk with them. I feel overwhelmed and if next year I have a class with him I want to switch because I know he’ll just make my life miserable. Could someone tell me what I should do or explain why this is happening and if it’s my fault? To add onto this my parents are physically and verbally and emotionally abusive and life just sucks.

What people don't understand is. Some people haven't lived life the same way you have. They haven't always been a good fit. They haven't always been skinny and athletic. They haven't always been popular and funny. They haven't had the same privileges as you and they certainly don't have the same accents as you do. They may have been bullied throughout their lives for the same reasons you make fun of them now and expect them to be cool with it and take it as a joke when in fact all of this continuous taunting hits a little close to home and brings back bad memories. So this forces you to be quiet and stay in a corner just so you don't get yourself noticed and could luckily find a way to save yourself from being humiliated in front of everybody.

Even after all that y'all have done to me, I have no grudges against you.
I just feel sorry for you and your pathetic lives.
I mean, didn't you have even an ounce of self respect back then?
You didn't bully anyone else but only me. Yes the physically weakest and the one with no friends to support him, to help him.
You were too scared to pick on some of the big guys or the ones with lots of friends. You chose the skinniest and the most helpless one. You tried your best to bring me down when I was passing through one of the toughest phases of my life. You kicked me when I was down. I used to think that one day, I will avenge all the tortures you put me through. That one day you'll will curse your self that why the fuck you ever messed with me. 
But not anymore. Wanna know why?
It's because all of my feelings of revenge are now replaced by feelings of sympathy for you!!
Yes, you read it correct, sympathy.
That's because all your lives were so pathetic that you had to pick on that small and skinny kid who was defenceless to feel better about for yourselves.
You thought that Making the rest of my life miserable would make you feel stronger and superior.
But guess what, you failed miserably here, just like you failed in all other aspects of life.
I've nothing against y'all, but just wanna ask one question!!
Was your life so pathetic that you had to pick on the weakest and the most helpless to prove your strength? You Know what what, those actions that made you think you're so strong actually make you the weakest of all the life forms ever known to exist.
I just hope that y'all find peace and start living a better and more honourable life."

Apparently at 4:30am, some teenage girl (supposedly) decided to send her a long message.  This girl does not know my kid, does not follow her, etc.  And my daughter's account is targeted around her service dog, not her personal account (matty_bo_batty).  So, my daughter sent her back a message....then I tracked her down and sent her my own little message.  I am so sick of bigoted people.  If you know your opinion is going to hurt someone, please keep it to yourself! Some people are very fragile!!!   See the text below:  


m.wardlaw13:  OKay so I understand that you are a girl wanting to be a boy but j have a question and I'm not trying to be mean or rude in any way but why do you think that you were made the way you are because that's how you were soposed to be!  Now, yes people do it all of the time and try to change the way that they look but getting surgery to change your whole body is still not going to change your sex because you came in this world a girl and YES you will go out of this world a girl! Like honestly why do.....You think you have to change the way you look just to be happy I mean you have friends and you have both boy and girl friends and yes there are many bisexual people at our school but I just don't get why you can't be happy with the way you are I mean God put us all on this earth to be happy and yes sad but it doesn't mean that just beach you aren't happy with the way you look means that just because you change from a girl to a boy doesn't mean that your body changes at all because you... And a lot of people all know that inside of your body it is a girl and it can never be changed I mean it's fine if your not happy with the way you look or feel because on your Instagram it said ""maybe when I'm older I will get upper and lower surgery and feel comfortable in my body"" Maddie your body will never change it will always be the same! Maddie your beautiful just the way you are and j don't know if anybody else has the guts to do this but you know what I honestly don't care I just....really don't understand why you think that just because you change the features on your body is going to change you from a girl to a boy! I mean come on that's like thinking that you can take an apple paint it orange and it becomes an orange but NOPE honey that's not how it works! I mean you will never have what a boy has no matter what you do and a boy will never have what a girl has all they can do is change the way you look and you know that everybody knows that inside your body you are...A girl and you were created to be a girl!  God made us to be on this earth so girls can be with boys and boys can be with girls not girls with girls and boys with boys and you are probably thinking well I am going to be a boy when I get surgery NOPE you are still and will FOREVER BE A GIRL! I mean how in the world do you think people were made I mean how do you think you were made obviously by a boy and a girl not a girl and a girl and not a boy and a boy but a girl and a boy! God made Adam...There would be nobody left cause a girl and a girl can't make a kid and a boy and a boy can make a kid it rakes a girl and a boy! But God created us all to be equal yes and that is why I respect the way you think but if you would just think about what i said and realize how all of this can affect your family and if you ever wanted kids cause the only way you are headed now is adoption cause you can't have kids if you keep trying to be something that your not!  Because that's what your being....Something that your not and I've heard people say oh well in just being myself NO YOU ARE NOT YOUR BEING ANYTHING BUT YOURSELF!  Thanks for taking the time to read this and I really hope you think about some of the things I said!


This was my daughter's response to her homophobic transgenderphobic rant:

First of all, try to check your spelling and grammar.  It's MATTY.  Second of all, Matty is my service animal.  Third, I AM a girl....who happens to model and do martial arts.  If I want to dress like a boy, that is my prerogative.  In case that word is too big for you, it means it is my right to do so.  Let's try pulling your head out of your ass and focus on your own pitiful life instead of something you have no clue about.  Pull yourself off your high horse or you will be going to Hell for your judgemental bullshit.  If I even attempt to think about the things you said, I might start to be like you and I'd rather cut my throat.  Have a freaking wonderful day!!!!


And I tracked down the so-called ""saint"" and I left her this message:  

If I EVER see your name pop up on my daughter's Instagram with some pathetic, homophobic, bigoted message, I will hunt you down.  And by that I mean you are nothing but a piece of shit bully who gets her rocks off by making others feel like shit.  And if I find out that your evil words cause someone to harm themselves, I will make it my personal mission to ensure that you are prosecuted for enticing them to harm themselves.  Then I will make sure you are in a prison where they fuck you up and make you regret every pathetic homophobic rant you ever made.  If a boy wants to be a girl or a girl wants to be a boy, that's up to them! They all have a beating heart, they all have brains to feel, and you are nothing but a hypocritical, judgemental BITCH.  There is a special place in Hell for you.  And I'll make sure that your special place is right next to me.

Sorry, but no one messes with my girl.  "
743,If a group of violent bullies approaches you...,7,34eplz,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/34eplz/if_a_group_of_violent_bullies_approaches_you/,0,1430435630.0,"First off let me say I'm sorry if this is happening to you. I was picked on and bullied lots in school when at that time we were told to suck it up its a part of growing up.. B.S.... 

Anyway if at all possible get away as soon as you can, but I found myself in a spot where retreate was impossible. That's why I'm writing this.  By no means am I condoning violence but, almost always there is one main aggressor and their cronies. Pick out the aggressor and only pay attention to them. Look them right in the eyes and say ""I know I'm going to lose and get hurt here by these people, but while that is happening I will drag you down with me and do any and everything I can to inflict as much permanent pain on you as I can. I may bite, rip or pull parts of you off, I don't know but I do know you will hold the scars of this day for the rest of your life"". 

I know it's been done in movies ect, but in real life this worked for me. I don't always say it will so be careful, but I had no other option and was betting a bunch of high school kids would risk a fight where I'm known to have ""problems"" and threaten that level of violence. 

TL;DR 
Scare and disturb the main aggressor and chances you will shake them up to not make the first move and his buddies won't either as they are only there for being a pussy reasons."

Also, every time I am eating he says sarcastically, "" Eat more, eat more. That's good for you.""

I feel powerless and out-of-control of this situation. I have gotten angry about it and told him to stop but he still continues. I now ignore him, but he still continues. 

I am trying to watch my weight and his name-calling is making me feel fat and making it more difficult to eat healthy. I am afraid that him calling me fat will actually work.

TLDR: My brother constantly calls me ""fat b*"" and obese while I am only ten pounds overweight and am trying to lose weight. How can I get him to stop? "

I'd like some advice, please.",5,q8tz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/q8tz6/college_freshman_here_and_still_haunted_by/,6,1330414810.0,"I apologize for the length. You're not a therapist (or are you?), but you may be a helpful ear.

Ever since I was 6 I've been bullied, but the classroom bullying didn't start until 2nd grade. My best friend (why I continued to be friends with her I do not know) basically told me what to do and belittled me to make herself feel better when I was little. I learned at a later age it was because she was jealous of me (her parents divorced, mine were together; my parents gave me a lot of what I wanted, her mother had been teaching her to be an adult ever since she started school). 

She doesn't treat me like that at all anymore, but because of being put down at a young age almost every day, I didn't have a lot of self confidence in school. I also found out at around 8 years old that I had ADD. I thought there was something really wrong with me, so I would act strange because I was worried about what other people thought. Around 5th or 6th grade whenever I would try to act outgoing or silly, no one liked it, or me for that matter. I thought that if I didn't talk at all, people would like me more. I just ended up being alone and only having that one best friend with me. I unfortunately made the dumb decision to be the ""emo kid"" in middle school, so I'd be recognized, but people would be too afraid to make fun of me. That obviously didn't gain me any social credit.

I changed in high school and didn't wear the dark clothes or listen to the terrible music, but people still made fun of me and didn't talk to me. My (can I even call it a past at that age?) past kind of haunted me. 

Now I'm in college, and I still to this day worry so much about what people think that I somehow repel others and seem really weird. Hell, I've even repelled a handful of people in the college band, which pushed me to quit. I've had suicidal thoughts ever since I was around 10 because of how weird and undeserving of being normal I thought I was. 

No one really knows this, but I really like to dance and act outgoing and goofy, but I'm afraid to be judged by students that I know from high school and students I don't know at all. There's an ""8th grade dance"" coming up, and I want to be myself without worry. I know I don't fit in with the quiet kids that like to draw, or stand around the side and watch other people dance and have a good time. I'm not that person at all, but everyone expected me to be that way. What can I do to not give fucks anymore?


TL;DR I've been bullied ever since elementary school, and now there's an opportunity that I can act myself but I'm still too scared. I'd like some advice on what to do. Thank you."
756,Some advice from someone (slightly) older,7,pqaf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/pqaf9/some_advice_from_someone_slightly_older/,0,1329310351.0,"I didn't grow up in the USA so I can't exactly say I fully relate, however all my life I felt I was the target of bullying... I went to a small school (less than 50 students per grade) and I've literally lost count of the number of people who would make fun of me/sometimes hit me. A funny example that comes to mind was in the 8th grade when a random guy who i've only talked to once or twice simply came up to me and said : Is it okay if I start ""owning""/making fun of you now"" and I just shrugged and said yes.

Basically here's what I can tell from my little experience:

1. One time a friend of mine got beat up real bad by a group of almost 4 bullies...what we did is that a group of almost 6 of us went to the principal (right then) and told her every small thing each of those kids ever did to us...they all got suspended, and never hit that guy again.

Tl;dr : if you want to ""talk to an adult"" go as a group, pick someone who can actually do something about it, and don't be scared.

2. I've been in college for almost 4 years now and I can tell you it is all different. People value uniqueness and individuality, also respect you based on your intellect and diction... or maybe that's because all my friends are hipsters I don't know

Basically I'd like to share a simple story that really made me happy : a small group of my friends  and I go to a bar trivia night thing which basically rewards geekiness...we've won it before i'm proud to say, but we're not the best there. One night the regular host wasn't there so a friend of his was subbing, and he was his polar opposite, asking sports questions and replacing the typical lord of the rings / star wars question with one about modern TV shows no one (important) has heard of. Anyways there was this group of douchy frat boys who were drunk and obnoxious, but were winning because of the lame ass questions, also because there were 11 of them (teams should be around 4 or 5)... apparently they annoyed not only us but the other regular teams, so we put aside our rivalries and joined together to make a super-team where we shared all our answers. basically it was anyone win but them. and I can't tell you how happy we were when they lost... our team even got the full winnings since the winning team had to leave early....

So yeah I went way off point, but what I'm trying to say is think a few years into the future: instead of making friends with people who clearly aren't going anywhere in high school, yet are the center of attention, make friends with all the interesting people who's company you'll enjoy later. Similarly don't dumb yourself down (as I see many intelligent girls do) instead embrace your intelligence: you have your entire college career to feel stupid :P

3. I know its corny but it does get better. While i had the wonderful opportunity of getting into an ivy league school, one of said bullies I heard only got into (crappy but expensive school for rich idiots). He was expelled on his second day despite his father's connections because he thought he could pull off all the stuff he did in high school in what is essentially the real world. 

So yeah think ahead and enjoy your time. the people you meet in high school will become very insignificant, and you'll probably never meet them again, unless you want to. Thus make sure to make friends with people you like and not to vie for the attention of people you won't want to see later (a mistake I still regret to this day)

So yeah sorry for the long post...Again I just saw the movie ""Bang Bang you're dead"" and was on other reddit boards for a while reading about the horrible things people did as kids, and I got pissed off all day...but yeah hope this helped and sorry for rambling too much

I didn't want to be popular or anything....I just wanted to be in good terms with everyone and not receive hate. I felt like I was in the wrong section and wanted to change to another class but the school doesn't allow that. Because of a grade 4 nightmare I became a try-hard at making friends grade 5 and I got alienated cuz no one likes a try hard. I eventually switched schools at grade 6 where the bullying stopped. I realized that I can't always be in good terms with everyone. Sometimes I have to end friendships or end up getting hate. It's the person's fault if he decides to hate me after I do the right thing.

759,My Senior Year,5,i6nism,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/i6nism/my_senior_year/,1,1597023873.0,"This is my first post on Reddit ever so, bear with me here. 

So, from the title this happened to me my senior year of high school. 

I was a part of the marching band for 3 years. (I moved my sophomore year.) I was a part of the flute section and we were good friends for 2 years until senior year came along. 

This was during mini-band camp. It started when I was just feeling depressed about something and my section leaders wouldn’t let me have the time to myself. They would constantly come to me saying the the needed me out there with the group and practice, and I got aggravated that I just couldn’t calm down without them pestering me. And the got mad when I was privately talking to someone about with and I told them I was talking to someone privately about it. I ran off again and cried really hard. Luckily the drum major was able to calm me down and I felt better. And when I wanted to talk to my SL’s they blamed me on getting the Drum major in trouble (she wasn’t) and were becoming very impatient with me. So I tried to leave but they called me back. I was still upset, I cried for the rest of the week, we were so distant from each other, but in the end it went back to normal. 

When actual all day band camp came along, I don’t know what I did but they were becoming pissed at me, accusing me of talking about them even though I was talking about my old school, and how I would get bullied there. They were mad and didn’t care if I was taking about my old school, they wanted me to stop talking out it. I, again, cried really hard, it was bad. My band director talked to me about it and he basically told me how he put his friend in jail, and how I need to “mend the bridges myself” with I’ve been trying to do, but they keep knocking it down. 

After that everything I did was wrong, I was being helpful to the flute section, to them, and to the people that eventually turned against me. They complained about me to everyone, they accused me of talking about them behind their back, and bad it to where most of the band hated me, my friend from another school caused drama on my snapchat and it got worse. And someone even screenshot It and threaten to show the staff for the marching band to get me in trouble. 

(Note: the person who screenshot the post caused a whole lot more drama then I ever did in that band) 

All in end that part was over, my friends school yelled at my school saying that this problem should’ve been dealt with before it even started.

At the time one of my grandparents (aka, my moms sister-in-laws dad) died from liver cancer, and my family were pretty close to him because he helped out a lot at the hotel my parents owned and to know he’s going to die soon, broke all of us. I went to practice after the funeral and my section leader that the audacity to tell her friend that “I never cared about my grandpa.” And “She always talked bad about him.” And it pissed me off, but I knew if I said something she would have lied to someone and they would go against me. 

And then the last straw was on one even rehearsal, and they were looking at me, giving me dirty looks, I didn’t go to sectionals (mini-practice) before the actual rehearsal and I told them why I didn’t go and it was because I didn’t want to deal with their negativity, and their constant accusations and finger pointing (which they’ve been doing for the whole week). They just told me that it was my problem and that I needed to get over it. I did a measly lazy middle finger to them, and boy did that PISS. THEM. OFF. They tried calling for staff, calling me the b-word, and accusing me of starting something. They told the band director. And the same day, my parents told the band director that they just wanted me to come hope without tears coming from my eyes. (This was their third attempt into getting my bad director to do something.) 

The next day was senior night. I heard I wasn’t going to perform during one of the shows. Because of this (which was bs, btw) and I was also feeling really bad. 

I ended up talking to a band mom about how bad I was feeling for hearing my name for senior night, and she told me to not let anyone ruin my senior night, and that made me feel better with her behind my back. But unfortunately, my section-leaders told the band director and after pregame, he told me that it was the last straw (no straws were given) and that I was running my mouth to a band parent, and he told me to leave immediately. I said ok, and got my stuff and left. I politely took my uniform off and put the flute up, thanking the person who I borrowed it from, another band parent was there and she gave me a hug and I cried, and I cried. When I got home I felt relieved but I still cried. 

I learned later that my section leader was proud of getting me kicked out. 

I cried at work, at school, and the counselor told me that I needed to focus on school, and cry during these classes. I was so mad, the administration did nothing, they told me to ignore it, and they told me that it would take time to make everything better. 

And the counselor, she didn’t help me at all. I told her how suicidal I was feeling because of this and she called my mom right in front of me and as I was covering my ears and yelling “No,no,no” continuously to drown out her loud voice in that tiny room. She told my mom about my feeling and it broke me even more to know that my mom is listening to someone who has no empathy, no kindness, compassion, patience. Just the voice as of a secretary tell my mother that her daughter wanted to take away her life. I felt worse, my mom would constantly text me asking if I was ok. 

The counselor even made me be a part of a meeting that consisted of her, me, the band director and my mom, who was on the phone. The director just told my mom that there was no sense of moving forward with me. And the counselor said they weren’t bulking me because there were no threats going around from them to me. Which made me really mad. 

I had constant panic attacks, rage, depressive episodes, I wore sweatshirts all the time and I was looking down every time I had to walk to class. My smile was non-existent and my eyes were filled with pain. Most of my friends stopped talking to me because band was all I could talk about. I would cry and cry about it, and there was nothing I could do. 

When second semester came along, one section leader that kicked me accused me of sabotage (I was part of the school magazine) and accused me of following her in the hallways, when our first period class was right across from each other. She complained and then I had to fill out filed a no contact contract against me from the school. She also had to sign but highly doubt she followed it. And I felt like I was forced to sign it, (I was 17 at the time, of that has anything to do with it) and I cried afterward as all feeling of freedoms has left me. I was scared and broken and lost, I was just about to feel better too.  She accused my of talking about her later and I was crying so much I went home, talking to the assistant principals and I told him I didn’t want to accuse her of thing but he said “yeah, not falsely accuse.” When she did the same thing and he praised her for it. 

But after that everything went okay, my mom spoke to the dean and they felt sorry, the principle even offered to pay for therapy. I didn’t really go to therapy, I felt like I had no time, but over time I got better. I still think about it. I know this will affect me greatly and even when I completely healed from it, it will still affect me. But I still learn from the experience, use it to make myself into a better person. 

[ Something else in mind, I recently saw a post from the person that kicked me out, and she talked about how she had a really good high school career and that she was the only flute player and two others that were graduating that year. And talking about how her band experience is was she loves and wants to give to her further students as a music education teacher. And it makes me mad, I want to call her out on her bs, and expose her to what she really did in high school, which was bully not only me, but her ex-best friend, who helped her boyfriend dumb her because he lost interest in her. She bullied her then-ex boyfriend and continued to be very toxic. 

I know that if I was to comment on that post, that also has pictures of me in group settings. I might come to bite me in the ass, but I was to expose how much of a horrible person she really is.]

I was about to start crying. I just wanted to stand up and run away. And then my sister said, “She doesn’t eat enough?

There was this other kid, who hanged out with the ""regular kids"", and I always considered him a ""frenemy"", because he would want to hang out with me, and the he would treat me like trash. The thing is I never did anything bad to him, but he would try to make my life hell, and the other kids did not care or did not do anything about it because they liked him better than me.

So I suffered a lot because of him, then I finally went to college, and became a new person, who had learned a lot of personal development, and who was willing to forgive everyone who had wronged me before, because I had found peace of mind.

After those years, I saw him again, and he again wanted to hangout, I figured he would have changed a bit too, after all if he hated me then why would he want to hang out.

Everything started really well, but suddenly switched again to being a complete moron, and after I had trusted him again, he had let me down once more. This act, really disappointed me, but I just decided to stay back and avoid him, and I hoped karma would take care of him on its own.

What happened now, even more years after, is that he has a girlfriend who he loves, estable income, friends, and he ""thanks god for all his blessings"". When I saw this statement (The cause of this post) It really triggered me, And I, well, I feel like I struggle through a lot more, and I hated seeing him say that, because he does not deserve what he has, he does not deserve to be ""blessed"", after what he did to me.

How can I get over this feeling of wanting ""justice""? I do know that probably his life is not as perfect as it seems, and that he has his own struggles as well, but still."

\---- 

During the months of stay-at-home orders, I've had a lot of time to reflect on my life and I think I was bullied or harassed by a school staff member when I was in elementary school.

When I was in the 5th grade in 1995, my sister started kindergarten at the same school. I think I may have blocked out most of the memories because I was embarrassed or humiliated, but I do remember being afraid to go to school because there was a staff member there who seemed to target me. Coming from a low-income neighborhood, all students at my elementary school qualified for free breakfast and lunch at the cafeteria. All my memories come from my time eating breakfast in the school cafeteria.

I think her name was Jackie. She was African American and was some sort of staff member who watched students while we ate breakfast in the cafeteria before school started. I was a quiet and shy Asian-American student and followed the rules, but Jackie always seemed to find something wrong with me or my sister and what we were doing, but even when my sister did something ""wrong,"" she would take out her anger on me. I blocked a lot of it out, but one vivid memory I had was her yelling at me that my sister's hoodie was up. Apparently, she had a rule that hoods had to be down indoors. She forcefully pulled her sister's hood down, but directed her words and anger at me, instead of telling my sister nicely about this rule.

I also projected this shame and anger on my kindergarten sister. For some reason, she didn't notice the anger and harassment I received due to her ""misbehaving"" by not pulling down her hoodie, or was oblivious to what was going on around her, even though we sat next to each other in the cafeteria. She just focused on her food while eating. I begged my sister to pull down her hoodie because that's the rule or at least it was Jackie's rule. I tried to pull my sister's hoodie down myself when we got inside the school and inside the cafeteria, but my sister being stubborn would always pull it back up and get mad at me for even attempting to put it down. It was no use and I was scared every morning because when Jackie saw my sister's hoodie up, she again would forcefully pull it down and tell me that I needed to control/manage/etc. my sister. When Jackie walked away, my sister would eventually pull her hoodie back up.

I was scared and was afraid of going to school, of going to eat breakfast, because of Jackie. I'm sure there were other humiliating instances, but I think I blocked them. The hoodie issue was the most vivid memory I have. Now, as an adult, I realize that this might be considered bullying or harassment. How can a child keeping their hoodie on be worth getting angry over? Why did she direct her anger at me? Why didn't she talk to my sister nicely and tell her that she expects students to pull down their hoodies when the get indoors.

Another aspect of all this is that I and most of the students in school were minorities: children of immigrant parents whose parents don't speak English well or they were African American. If I had to guess, the demographic makeup of my elementary school might have been 10% white, 20% Black, 20% Asian, and 50% Latinx. Typical rules about etiquette or decorum, such as not wearing hats indoors for example, was not obvious to me and many of my classmates whose parents were recent immigrants to the U.S. in the 1980s. Jackie was an African American woman so I don't know if she was raised with this rule of not wearing hats indoors, but I don't know if it was an ""official"" rule in school or if it was a personal rule she had while she oversaw us in the cafeteria while eating.

Is it worth emailing my elementary school or school district about this? Maybe I just needed to get this memory off my chest."
764,BULLIED DURING COLLEGE,3,gn585p,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/gn585p/bullied_during_college/,7,1589980363.0,"I just wanted to share what happened to me. This didn’t go one for too long, since it was a hybrid online and in person class which was just a semester, but dealing with these people felt like forever.

I had a business class and we were randomly assigned into groups by the professor and each week we had an assignment to complete which contributed to a final project that we were supposed to present in person at the end of the semester. The group that I was assigned to was super lazy, I tried to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and think maybe they were shy, but when I tried to reach out even more they would give excuses like “I can’t meet up or work on the project BECAUSE I WORK OUT” so I tried to be patient with them until it was already the 3rd week of class and I found myself just dealing with the project on my own. Whenever I tried to talk to them
about prompts and stuff, I would just get “yea...ok..idk...ask the professor” but when I would read the group chat, they would communicate with another like — “YEAH BRO! Thanks bro....So about this teacher, I heard she’s a dumb *** with a thick accent so expect an easy A”  <— them saying this made me feel scared about my team like I know it’s normal to have conversations about a teacher being an easy grader, but the way they talked was just so  
:( BTW two of them were siblings and the other team member was already their friend. I was the odd one out...  so on the 2nd or 3rd week of class, I received a text from them saying “So you’re gonna submit the next assignment for us right? I can’t work on it now since I’m still at the gym but we’ll help you after”
This really made me give up and so I asked the professor if I could change groups..as much as possible I didn’t want to bring it up, but they professor said she couldn’t move me unless I gave a reason, so I told her that my group mates didn’t want to work on the project yet even though we were already a couple weeks in..
So I got assigned to another group. When I told them that I decided to move to another group cause I had a friend there, they texted me super angrily like “ARE YOU STAYING OR WHAT?? You’re gonna regret this. We’ll see you during presentation day. Screw you. I doubt you’ll perform better” whether I performed worse than them or what, I didn’t care, I just wanted to be away from toxic people..

This is where things get worse...on presentation day, my team projected my part but was being blocked by a shadow and I couldn’t see majority of my parts although I knew what I was talking about, I didn’t memorize specific data since there were a lot of numbers. On the corner of my eye, I saw my old team go “pfft” or those about to laugh noises then they brought out their phone and went like “oooh she’s the one” then I could just hear them laugh it was so bad. I am not a good public speaker too so I get nervous. Next was them and they presented really well and confidently too the class was impressed with their presentation cause they were good at speaking.

I really felt like a loser this day it’s funny how mean people and bullies can be smarter and better than you too. They’re not always the dumb ones, but one thing that’s consistent is that they will try to take advantage of people they feel are weaker than them. I don’t regret leaving but I wish I looked more confident in my presentation...I really looked like a fool. :("

Of course I never actually did the bullying, but I just had to be with the “cool kids.” Also... I was scared I might get bullied. 

Anyways, my bullied friend moved away. I thought everything was over, but I couldn’t have been so wrong.

For the first few months after he moved, everything felt normal. Like as if nothing had changed. But the memories started to come back whenever I walked by the spots he was bullied at. There was a bathroom near the gym that no one really used. That’s where he got his face dunked in. Now, every time I walked by all I could think about was how big a coward I was. I could have done something, anything. But no. I only looked out for me. 

His locker was right next to our math class (I had math with him). Every time I went to our math class, I can just see him screaming “stop doing this!” I can hear him banging on the locker and finally giving up. I can see the assholes that stuffed him in the locker, just laughing when he finally stopped banging. 

But the worst part of it was I also saw myself just standing there, just so I can fit in..... be part of the cool gang. I saw myself feeling like a loser; a dead soul. I was dead inside. I didn’t have my own stance, my beliefs, my morals, well if I did... I definitely didn’t want to show it. I would tell myself for years, “I never actually bullied him myself. I never even laughed or thought it was cool to do that.” 

Oh, how stupid, stupid, stupid. The fact that I had to live with these thoughts for 10+ years just shows that, not only was I part of the bullying, but I did nothing to help a friend in need. Someone who was actually a good person. Who actually liked hanging out with me. 

Guys... don’t be a bystander. That doesn’t make you not part of the bullying. It’s actually worse than bullying. Bullies have a reason they bully. Sometimes they themselves are bullied at home by their parent, so they just take that out on someone weaker. Now, this is NEVER ok obviously. (Taking out your anger on others that is) 

But, you? You have no reason to not stop a bully. You have no reason to help a friend in need. You have no reason to think that what they’re doing is non of my business. You have no reason to be ok with someone being used for other’s entertainment. You. Have. No. Reason. 

If you feel bad watching some one get bullied, you’re a good person on the inside. It means you don’t want to see people suffer. But you have to show that on the outside that makes you a real person. All you need do is stand by your friends in need. I’d like to call that a standbyer someone who stands by you when no one else will.

Please. Please. Please. Do not regret something that could have been stopped. Do not be a bystander, be a standbyer.

Thank you."

770,Nobody talks about where members are bullied by staff in a gym or unfairly have membership terminated at huge emotional cost,5,f07dzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/f07dzm/nobody_talks_about_where_members_are_bullied_by/,2,1581090872.0,"I know of at least two people who have experienced gratuitous bullying by STAFF at a gym either by the gym managers or by overbearing instructors. Both with no warning had their gym memberships terminated on the spot and were asked not to ever return. Both had been very regular gym goers for many years. Both were women. I know them both very well and can't understand why on earth their memberships would have been terminated or they'd have been treated this way. Maybe by going so often they were loss makers for the gym so it was not economical to keep them, showering every day costs water, maybe someone did not like them, who knows? According to Google this problem does not exist, harassment happens in gyms, among members or between staff members but there is NOTHING about staff members harassing members. Are these the only two people this has happened to? Seems unlikely. One of them got her lawyers onto the case and they got her membership reinstated but the gym management then REPEATED the bullying by sending her a written notice when they noticed she had left one class before the cool down, which is something lots of members routinely do with no such notices. Her lawyers wrote again and in the end the gym ended up making a huge out of court settlement to her, her legal fees, medical expenses, it was well over half a million dollars because she got into a deep depression following their bullying. So, are these the only two cases in the world or has anyone else experienced mistreatment from gym management?"

773,Help Me Please,4,dq52q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dq52q4/help_me_please/,2,1572647788.0,"My [16f] little brother [12m] is being bullied in school, has been for several months, maybe since the beginning of the year. He doesn't really talk about the bullying, and so I only know very little about what he's experiencing.

It's extremely important to the story to say we live in a very religious town, where the schools are terrible. We moved here maybe six years ago, with no understanding of how the town was. Turns out they are crazy strict about religion and everyone here has white skin. Now my dad is mulatto, but dark enough that should someone look at him, they would think him black. My brother has darker skin, too, but should someone look at him, he only looks to have a nice tan. However, my brother plays baseball and the kids would've seen our dad, who helped coach, and seemed to come to the conclusion that my brother has African American blood running through his veins.

He's in middle school, 7th grade, and began having trouble with school in 6th grade. First, it was the teachers; they liked to yell real loud and give out the wrong grades - my brother takes his grades extremely seriously. There was one teacher in particular who especially bothered my brother, so he was dealt with. Otherwise, everything else was brushed off as ""that's life, get used to it,"" or ""teachers are people, too. They just made a mistake,"" because in all honesty, my brother thought an annoyed indoor voice was yelling, and his grades were always corrected within the week.

The real problems began in 7th grade. The kids call him the n word degradingly, make fun of his eating habits and weight (he can eat a lot, but he's a healthy weight, has a bit of a roundness to his belly), they falsely accuse him of theft and destruction of property, and even the teachers are quick to assume him guilty of these accusations. He's missed a good number of days from school, maybe coming up on ten or fifteen, and right now he's only attending half days, where my mum will drop him off an hour after school starts and pick him up around noon.

My fear is him being determined truant, and what potential steps the school might take to get him to attend a full day of school. I have my own experiences with these steps, and I've told him how traumatizing they were, how much I regret what happened, and how much I wish I could've been a normal student. My own personal issues with truancy screwed up the rest of my school years, and much more. I don't want that for my brother.

I understand parents getting involved can make things worse, and my brother refuses to let them do anything, but my brother doesn't seem likely to stand up for himself; he's tough mentally, but also sensitive. His self esteem is taking a real hit, though. He cries a lot, particularly at night before bed, and in the morning, before school. He's been checking his weight constantly, and he starves himself some days.

My parents got him a session with a therapist, but he refused to talk. We were lucky to get what we got out of him. I can't do anything, because I don't attend the same school as him. If he isn't willing to help himself, what can we do?

How do we tackle this bullying?"
774,I need clarification,4,dpahmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dpahmy/i_need_clarification/,4,1572488237.0,"Honestly, this may seem obvious but I need clarification. I feel sooooo guilty but I don’t know if this is considered bullying or if this is because of something bad I did.

I had a lot of friends in elementary but when we went to middle school things changed. The first two months things were fine and then people started being cruel to me. People that I just met in middle school told me that no one (including my elementary friends) liked me. People yelled at me and made fun of me because I am Asian and I don’t have chink eyes or can’t eat with a chopstick even though most of them are white and I didn’t know why they’d care about that. Often people yelled at me and said that everyone hates me and it’s my fault. People gave me dirty looks, walked away when they saw me approaching and always ignored me. 

Even my old friends ignore me and insult me and belittle me. People say that I changed and that I think I’m full of myself or that I’m annoying or whatever. But if I thought I was full of myself I wouldn’t feel guilty about this and I’d blame them. 

Could my friends bullying me have something to do with coming to middle school? Why were they so quick to turn on me? Is this even bullying or a result of something bad I did that they didn’t tell me about?

Im in gr9 now but I think I have social anxiety as a result because every time I was being myself I was put down, made fun of, laughed at, insulted or yelled at and I have no idea what I did. But if so many people were doing it and the ones who didn’t watched and laughed then it must have been my fault right? If no one came to my aid did I not deserve it? If this isn’t bullying what is it?"

However, and this may be hard to explain, I sometimes feel it in my mind again. It's like I can feel my child/teenager-self inside of me wanting to scream and cry, usually when I think about the bullying or when I read/see something related to it which leads to overthinking. It's like there's this locked up crying/yelling feeling inside of me that shows up and doesn't go away even if I do cry (very rarely) or talk about it. It's like it is there even when I don't feel it. I don't know how to explain. It's almost like my brain doesn't feel like the bullying is over even though I know it is. It's like my brain is screaming ""Please go away. Leave me alone"".

I'm doing this project because I and many of my close friends were bullied too, and I want to raise awareness for how it truly feels, so that people will no longer see it as a ""kids will be kids"" situation but as the true, alarming problem it is. 

You don't have to have been bullied yourselves to answer the survey, you can also write on behalf of someone else.

So then the physical things started happening (Mind you, we had a sub, so there wasn't anyone around to give a crap). They started hitting me, pushing me and tripping me. As soon as that bell rang I tried to get out of there ASAP. But, well... I tried. As soon I past the bathroom in the hall, they jumped me and started beating me up. They started punching me and hitting until I passed out. The only thing that saved me from potential death is from when one of my friends walked in. He's a tall, huge kid, and TBH, he saved my butt, BIG time. Long story short, 911 was called, kids were arrested, and I ended up with two ribs fractured, and one room broken, and a black eye along with broken nose. Can you guys tell what to do about this? Edit: Thank you guys for the help, the kids are getting charged with assault and some other crap I can't remember.

I bullied a kid into being my friend because hd didn't have any friends. I was wrong but I was in so much pain. I couldn't tell my mother and she was the only one there. It would have killed her. She had alot of problems.

When I got to middle school I was voted ugliest guy in school. Everyone made fun of me for being poor. The satisfaction people got out of bullying me is unbelievable. I had  one person use me for friendship because they were alone. It was a relief to not be alone. I had another person that I hung out with after school but it was an abusive friendship. We were not really friends and he made me feel awful. Again it was nice not to be alone.

    In middle school I was one of the ugliest in the class many of the girls there were pretty so they got everything easy. They would ask me for homework and I gave it to them because I wanted to be liked by them. I am terrible at math always was but one of my classmates decided it was fine to make fun of my low score in front of me of course I didn’t say anything but the people around me laughed. They never talked to me other than that. Each year of middle school I only made one or two friends and they were transfer students. They were good friends but with my luck they either transferred school or changed classes so I was alone.
There were some boys who treated me horribly making rude remarks about my face or weight were fun for them to poke fun at. I held in my tears because if I cried I knew I wouldn’t stop cause of the embarrassment. I was sensitive back then I couldn’t take jokes directed at me but I still held my composure. 
I hated everything about me, I felt like I wasn’t pretty enough. I remember I would cry at night wishing If I just could have been born prettier maybe I would be more liked by everyone. The girls in my class sometimes made fun of a mute boy in class or a girl from another class on what she wore. Now I wished I could had stopped it but back than I didn’t have the confidence to do so. 

Another time was around the last year of middle school it was when I was walking back from tutoring. It was snowing so I felt something hid my bag, the group of boys apologized and I said it’s fine, I just wanted to go home by than. Than one of the boys suggested I hug the boy who accidentally threw the snowball at me. I refused and that’s when things started to get tense. They started to talk about me and I blocked it out by crossing the road and they followed me. One of them ran past me their hand almost collided at the side of my face. I just didn’t say anything cause what I was taught was that if you give no reaction then they’ll leave you alone. They didn’t they ran past me and waited ahead. I could have changed streets but I knew they would have followed. When I walked past them they started throwing snowballs at me and I kept ignoring them. Than they started to call me average looking and making fun of me. One of them had the audacity to say “Isn’t this bullying?” While continuing to throw snowballs. They stopped after i walked towards a more populated area. I just hurried home and didn’t tell anyone about it instead I just cried about it later at night. 

Looking back on everything now they targeted me cause I was weak and would do anything they asked. In middle school they didn’t care about me at all sometimes they acted like they did but they would just move on to their other friend. So thanks middle school classmates for giving me low self esteem and making me think I’m inferior to all of you. And to those group of boys who targeted me thanks for making me have a panic attack whenever I walk past a large group of guys. 

But now I can say I’m more confident in myself now that I have better friends I still have my highs and lows but it isn’t as bad as in middle school days."

I was constantly harassed by the same people for three years straight, I lost my confidence, positive thoughts and most of my social skills with all of this harassment going on to this day. It was horrible, and that I need a psychologist to evaluate my mental state sometimes and I need to have constant counseling for two years. My mental health deteriorated quickly, and that I even though of self harm or even suicide at least twice. I was in the stage of hopelessness and I was ready to give up anytime.

Until I met someone who I'll call ""Jane"" from now on

I met Jane in the cafeteria while I was crying and loosing my appetite, we both faced each other and our conversation slowly become somewhat of a counseling session. At that point, Jane was the only person pulling me back into reality and prevented me from going into the stage of psychosis. I started to meet up with her everyday and talked about how my day was and what happened to me. Sometimes I would go to her in tears or sometimes without any expression at all. She was understanding, and she managed to push me through all the crap I was facing through for the last two years.

&#x200B;

\*fast forward to  last year\*

&#x200B;

Jane just came back from her transfer to Mexico and apparently she has to repeat Grade 11 again. We just happened to meet each other in one of the classes, but we also have the bullies in the same class as us. I started to talk to her again and we became great friends, when a rumor about me liking Jane leaked out, it became a magnet for bullying.

Since I was assigned to the ROTC along with all the high school boys, I started to feel the full force of indirect bullying. First they started harassing me on common stuff, then they turned to start and bully Jane behind her back, doing anything to flip me off.

I held on to that for 3 months until me and Jane decided to get on the shuttle bus to a sky-train together. We both went on the bus and we have the bullies back... this time harassing her and me at the same time while pushing me to go sit right next to her (I gave her personal space). She then snapped and we got separated immediately after the bus reached our destination. She just ran off, and for two weeks we've been hostile to each other because of a rumor that I wanted to confess to her (she's not okay for any type of relationship other than friend)... I almost lost a friend though bullying.

A month or two later I also found out that Jane was a prime target for bullying too because:

She's Israeli-Mon

She has difficulty controlling her mood

She likes to isolate herself

She is sensitive

And she is just different from the others in general

&#x200B;

Now we are friends again, but I still am quite worried about her mental capacity to hold on to this crap, and that I am praying that she'll be able to fight back and live a normal life like any other human."
800,Bullying and how it's affected me.,5,bz8u7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bz8u7e/bullying_and_how_its_affected_me/,3,1560262221.0,"Hi everyone, 

I think my first experience ever with bullying started when I was maybe in the 4th or 5th grade. & I still remember the things that my classmates did to me that still haunts me till this day. 

(I still feel so much anger for this one girl who started it all, that I ALMOST want to just use her name because of how uncommon it is, but I won't.)

  I remember AIM used to be so popular, that I asked one of my friends to make an account for me, because my mom's laptop had a weird lock on it, so I couldn't sign up myself. 

So I started using AIM with the rest of my classmates, and I tried to become friends with this girl, we'll call her Y. Y was popular and like everyone else, I flocked to her. She was nice sometimes, but now looking back she was just using me.  (She one time tried to borrow my camera and never return it). 

If I tell you in detail of what she did it'll be super long, so I'll make bullet points and add detail.

* She made a group chat on AIM with the 30 kids in my class and had them all curse me out and call me fat and make fun of my name (If you've watched fairy odd parents, you'd know which name.) This went on for the entire 5th grade, and my friend that made my account gave my password to everyone in my class so they could change my status to stuff like ""I'm a pig"" ""I eat so much"" ""I'm so ugly"" etc.
* She would ask to hang out at my place, eat all my food and play nice for the few hours and then online (AIM) she would continue to bully and curse me out. Each time at school telling me she was joking, but then on AIM she would call me stupid for believing her. (This happened more than 1 time maybe 10 times before I gave up) 
* She made a group chat on AIM with all her church friends telling me they're apart of the Flushing Crew and they know where I lived and was going to come to beat me up. (This went on for a few months, to the point where I didn't want to leave my house). They would always say that god would forgive them (probably why I'm not a believer). 
* She followed me to middle school, and repeated the cycle \^above for the next three years after. At this point, I started growing tougher skin and a backbone and started talking back. She would pull my hair, get her friends to threaten me because I was giving her ""attitude"". 

There's a lot more that she's done but I have to stop here because it triggers me whenever I think of it or see her name. I know that this experience has made me tougher and I dont take anyone's shit, but no one understands me when I say that the past affects the future. I am so mentally scarred from these experiences, that my trust issues are super low. I am extremely aggressive because I couldn't fend for myself before. 

I've tried to get help for this, and each time I get told to look within myself. I would like to think 4th grade me had good intentions.  

It makes me even more upset, when people that bullied me are now condeming bullying on their social media platforms. One in particular said ""People who bully others are worse than scum"". 

I think I just need someone that would read this and not tell me to just forget about it, because how can I?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Bullied really bad and people around me are giving me sort of bad advice."
801,My bully was my middle school counselor,6,byh8co,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/byh8co/my_bully_was_my_middle_school_counselor/,3,1560088535.0,"Through 6-8th grade the counselor  (Mrs. Cole) accused me of lying about being assaulted, lying that I wanted to kill myself, and lying that I was pregnant. I had been bullied since kindergarten up until my freshman year when I started home schooling. In 6th grade I was sexually assaulted by someone and ended up getting pregnant(i was I had a miscarriage at age 12), I told one of my ""closest"" friends and she told the whole school I was lying. A few weeks later I got called into the counselors office, she told me to sit down and talk to her about stuff. I didn't like her because of other things that she's done. She proceeded to tell me that I was to ""fat"" for someone to rape, (I was 5'7 and 120lbs I come from a very broad, tall, and big family I suffered from bulimia and anorexia at the time) she called my mom and said that I was lying to get attention and I needed to be put into a mental hospital. My mom never put me in one and she still thinks I was lying about everything. Skip to 7th grade Mrs. Cole called me in because I had cut myself and one of the kids that bullied me seen and went crying to her because they were scared I was going to die. I went in there and she grabbed me by the arm (on my cuts) and told me I was a ""lying slut"" I was crying due to my anxiety and the pain. She let go and threw a pencil at me and told me to get out of her office. She called my mom and said I THREW A PENCIL AT HER because she caught me lying again. My mom didn't believe her so when I got home she pulled up my shirt sleeve and wrapped my arms up. Since then my mom has hated that shitty excuse for a counselor. In 8th grade she tried to send me to a mental hospital twice, theirs to hold me back, and called the cops on me because I kissed my boyfriend at the time on the cheek. She said she caught me trying to RAPE him in the bathroom. As soon as I got into high school my depression took a turn for the worst, I started cutting, popping pills, drinking, I had bulimia, and I was trying to kill myself at least once a week. But all through that my Ma has stay by my side and was always there to hold me while I cry into my cuts and throw up. She never once tried to put me in a hospital even though I needed it, she always told me that it would get better and I have to stay here. She's really my best friend and I love her for that. (I had a lot of other trauma happen to me but I don't want to share it) IF YOU READ ALL THIS THANK YOU!! also call or text your mom/dad/sister/brother/grandparnts/aunts and uncles and tell her thank you for always being there when shit got rough."

&#x200B;

I have noticed a peculiarity in my behaviour and I wonder if any one else has this?

&#x200B;

I have historically not been good at asserting or defending myself. Yet, if I see someone else being picked on/ bullied I always rush to the victims defence and stick up for them. I dont understand why I am able to do this for someone else, even a stranger, but not myself. I am sure people will day it is because I am a good person or kind .... meh, I am not a 6 year old any longer and the real world is a battle ground for an introvert. I need and want to change. 

&#x200B;

Consequently , I seem to expect others to rush to my defence in other circumstances which obviously never happens.

806,I was bullied by my friends and I’m hoping to help others.,6,bu1fbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bu1fbp/i_was_bullied_by_my_friends_and_im_hoping_to_help/,1,1559086357.0,"This was happening when I was young and it gave me suicidal thoughts and other mental health problems, I hope to help others who are in the same situation.

So if you’re being bullied by “friends”, I’m here to help.

If it’s mental or physical, I’ve been through it. 

Mental bullying: 

They may be hurling insults at you saying horrible things etc, but this is not because your “worthless” or “pathetic” no, it’s because they want to hurt you so they either: become popular or make you feel worthless. 

Just think that you have a shield and those words are spears, trying to cut through that shield to get into your head. That shield are your real friends, they will deflect your fake friends attacks, but if you don’t have any real friends that shield is yourself and your family. 
You can talk to your family about it, it doesn’t make you weak. This is something that I didn’t do and so it made it worse, so please, for your health talk to someone. Get real friends, real friends don’t judge by appearance they judge by character, they don’t make fun of you for being who you are. They’re like family.

Physical bullying:

All types of physical bullying are horrible but being physically bullied by fake friends is even worse. 
If they kick, punch, hit or slap. You have every right to defend yourself, you won’t be called a snitch by telling them to your parent/carer or teacher, it’s for your own good. 
If there’s no-one around to tell or to protect you, you have to protect yourself, you have to buy yourself time to escape or fight. 
You’ll enter fight or flight mode and you’ll need to pick between them. 

I hope this helps people suffering with friend bullying, just remember you’re not alone, reach out to someone. See a therapist/doctor. They’re there to help you."

The fault lay in me. I recognized that. 1) Lack of self-awareness 2) lack of concentration ( perhaps slight ADHD)

How I  fought bullying or rather overcame this is (despite lack of attention retention)

I became too busy. Earlier too I had always had a stockpile of interesting things to do. So the brain wave in me said, ""practice thinking of them when bullying occurred"". Now, I think I have attained the expertise to **remember, this.** I give a slight nod and smile and pretend I am so busy with my work.

**People or rather not so good humans attack the ones they feel are weak.** I guess I had been showing out my despair.

Either we should **learn to act to put on a good facade** or **if we cannot act**, then we should become our best friend and **analyze ourselves and correct ourselves.**

It is by **practice.** Still, I am practicing. I have achieved 80 % success, I think.

When I analyzed myself I found these faults in me

had been very friendly and nice to everyone. To correct this, I m learning tact and how to set boundaries

I learnt how to look stern. It took about 6 months to practice this and make it a permanent feature of mine.

Basically, I tied myself to my already existing passions more. That's how I also learnt how not to give a fuck"

Let's start from the beginning. 

So I had a robotics class last quarter with a guy that I referred to at the top as A. We had to program robots to do certain things on certain boards (LEGO Mindstroms) in this class. I was usually the one coding but we had to let the other people in our group do something else, since we would get pretty bored of our usual jobs. In my group, there was me, A, and 4 other people. A is the sort of guy who acts like he's really tough, but you can tell he really isn't. But in this case he was a little bit. He's a bit taller than me, I would say about 5 foot 6. Im 5 foot 3. A used this to his advantage. Everyday, if I did the tiniest bit wrong out of my normal coding job, he would punch me. Hard. Now, I would try to fight back, but me, being the flimsy armed weakling I am, couldn't do anything about it. I told the teacher after the few times he did it, but sadly enough, that teacher was that one careless assholes of a teacher. ***He yelled at me for SITTING DOWN***. He literally took A's side of the story, that I was ""testing"" A. My teacher yelled at ME for confronting him about getting beaten up. I wasn't joking when I said he was a careless asshole. So then after he did nothing, I went to my next teacher, who was a nicer, selfless teacher. I told him what happened, and guess what? He actually did something about it! Tried to, anyway. He did the best he could. He sent an email to the vice principal of the school. And you know what she did? She sent A to the school counselor. From what I know, the school counselor just told him to stop and let him go. He kept doing it. Multiple emails were sent to the vice principal after that one, and nothing happened. Nothing.

After that quarter, I moved on to 4th quarter, where (thank god) I didn't have any classes with A or the teacher that didn't do anything. But it continued. A knows where my locker is. *Every day* A walks up to at my locker, says something mean, or does that stupid thing that some people do (idk if this is just a thing in my school or not) that everyone called a ""scoop"". basically where you make your hand into kind of a bowl, then ""scoop"" upwards on their nipple, and surprisingly enough, it kinda hurts. Don't ask. I don't know who invented it or why, but it's a thing. But today, oh today, he took it ***TOO. FUCKING. FAR.*** So I have this little whiteboard in my locker i use for reminders and stuff. A decided today he would take the pen for it, erase everything on it, and write ""I LOVE DICK"" on it, in big, bold words while I wasn't looking. Didn't notice for a while. Wide open for everyone to see. The second I noticed it, I erased it. It was too late. Everyone saw it and spread it around the school. People laugh at me in the hallways. People call me gay (which i'm not). People make fun of me about it. It's my reputation now. I hate everything. And to add on to it, I already have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. A knew this. I've been dealing with bullying since preschool. A knew this. I'm suicidal already. A knew this. I hate everything now. I can't see nice people anymore. I don't even have that many friends. 

What I, myself have done about it so far, is told 3 of my stronger friends, and one person who volunteered, to beat the living hell out of him, which, they said they would do. I have a few other plans to beat up some people that have made fun of me about it, and have been spreading it to all the popular people. I have plans to take advantage of them, and use one fighting techniques I now know. Despite all my plans, I *did* come home from school crying today because of all the assholes that are in my school that made fun of me today. But, though that did happen. from what I know, a lot of shit's gonna happen tomorrow. I'll keep you guys updated. Any advice would be appreciated."

Its really childish but i didnt really do anything. Even its such a small little thing that happend i got these bullying flashbacks and i didn’t come up for myself again and im mad at myself. I just want to let him know not to f*ck with me so i was wondering if i just tap he’s shoulder aswell (i know its childish but i just want him to remind that he did it to me!) and laugh at him.

Update; a day ago, he asked me if I had sex before with guys and girls, and if I was a virgin. 
I wont state my exact age here, but I am in high school and under the legal age of consent in my country. I answered no, and mentioned that I was underage. 
He just looked at me in a weird way( can't describe it- had this look like he knew something I didn't and found it funny) and laughed. Also, ( and once again, maybe I am being paranoid) I think he looked at my breasts ( he was staring at my chest for a moment) 
It made me SUPER uncomfortable. I am a girl, and he's older than me ( and physically bigger). It made me feel kinda threatened too? Maybe I'm being oversensitive, but in my mind its really not okay to ask a girl you barely know if she is a virgin or not. Maybe its his way of joking around or something, but it really made me feel weird. 
I don't know what to do? My mother knows he's being rude to me, but she would probably blow it way out of proportion if I told her the things he said. I would tell a teacher, but he would know it was me who told on him. 
Any suggestions?"
818,My story in college as a victim of bullying,6,bf604z,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/bf604z/my_story_in_college_as_a_victim_of_bullying/,2,1555746418.0,"Hi there everybody, this is a long story so apologies in advance!

My story is based around not only my experiences with bullying, but how the bully can socially benefit from being a bully, and how wider communities can see it as a positive trait when they don't acknowledge the victim. I also talk a bit about social hierarchies regarding popularity and probably more stuff too.

So a bit about myself to begin with! I am a British college student and I was generally fairly happy until a few weeks ago. I had an amazing girlfriend who I still have, as well as good friends - if only a few. Since it's still a school, there are hierarchies of popularity and I'd say I'm somewhere near the bottom. In all honesty I've come to be fine with this: in the long run it's not important and as long as I'm not alone then I'm okay.  In the past I was the victim of a lot of bullying: I was frequently verbally and emotionally bullied by my peers in high school, they often did it to seem ""cool"" and had the aim of impressing other kids through humiliating and joking about me - at my own expense of course. It led me to experience severe anxiety and a loss in self-confidence, and I was just generally fucked up from it. But since then I have moved on after years have passed, I don't interact with those people anymore and it seemed like just a bad dream.

So enough about myself, I'm here to talk about my experiences these last few weeks. So here goes.

In my college there were applications open for the students to run for president of the Student Union in an election. It basically involved making a speech, campaigning with posters around school, and the school votes on their favourite candidate. Being interested in politics and wanting to leave my comfort zone, I signed myself up. The problem with these elections at my school is that the kid with the most friends tends to win, regardless of how good they were. So only having a few friends I wasn't expecting to win, but I didn't really mind since I just wanted to try. I was still optimistic, there was always a chance that I could win.

As soon as I signed up I got to work on my speech and on my posters. I probably dropped a grade because of how much time I dedicated to this. I must've redrafted my speech ten times, and I spent just as much time on my posters that looked professional. In summary, I worked so hard on this. I was passionate and determined, and it made my confidence grow. The other people who signed up hadn't started and I was already prepared. It was a good feeling, almost as if I was an underdog since everyone else were considered ""popular"" and I wasn't the person anyone expects to win. I was ready to give it my all and prove that someone different is in with a chance of winning.

So after around a week, all of the students running were summoned to brief with the teacher who was managing the election. We were all in the same room and it was at this point that I realised that all other candidates were friends with each-other. They were extremely confident since they had a massive amount of friends backing me up. I should've felt intimidated, pessimistic, but instead I felt somewhat empowered, feeling even more like a kind of underdog. It was still a good feeling like I was reaching towards a goal that I'm working hard for.

After we briefed with the teacher, this guy comes in to the room and asks to sign up to run as a candidate. It was strange for many reasons. First of all, he had signed up basically last-minute: he didn't have any preparation and it didn't even seem like he wanted to win even if he had a chance. This leads to my second reason why it was strange, the guy wasn't popular at all - sort of like me - and this meant that he had essentially no chance of winning so it was odd that he would sign up. I vaguely knew him (let's call him M), he wasn't my friend exactly, but we did have mutual friends yet I didn't know much about him. The final reason why he was so strange was that he regularly glared at me and smirked, as if he was laughing at something. At the time I ignored it and moved on.

So fast forward to the day we read our speeches to the school. I was pretty nervous but I volunteered to read mine first to get it out of the way, but also to prove to people and myself that I was serious. I got on the podium, and not to sound arrogant but I NAILED IT! I spoke clearly, I got my points across, and I got a loud applause from the school when I was done. Even my opponents congratulated me. I felt so happy, so confident right after I did it. And for a brief moment, I genuinely thought I was going to win.

Then it was M's turn to do his speech, he volunteered to do it right after me. It was odd since he had no script, instead he was going to say it on the fly, which was really unusual. Even when he got to the podium he kept smiling at me and I wasn't sure why, until he started saying his speech. It was horrible. All he did was make fun of my character, my speech, anything he could think of. The worst part was that he mentioned my girlfriend as well. He didn't say my name since you couldn't attack other candidates, but he didn't have to. Everyone knew he was talking about me. And everyone loved it. I had to remain standing to the side of the podium as the audience glared at me, laughing. I couldn't do anything except laugh along, pretend that they were laughing with me and not at me. It was humiliating, and reminded me vividly of what I had to bear in high school. Imagine somebody going on a stage, verbally attacking you before an audience for over 5 minutes, and is responded to with uncontrollable laughter. It's not something many could say they've experienced that's for sure.

After the speeches, I felt so shitty. I felt idiotic for being so previously optimistic before M did his speech. My self-confidence instantly plummeted. Meanwhile M - who previously wasn't known by almost anyone - was constantly praised, applauded, congratulated. It didn't end there though. After we were to do our speeches, the campaigns were set to begin. I put up my posters but anytime I did they were covered or surrounded with more ""jokes"" that went after me, belittled me, humiliated me. This was M's campaign. But often the posters were made from other people entirely, wanting to get in on the fun. Each poster was like a punch in the face and gradually sent me to how I was back in high-school: anxious, depressed, and numb.

It still didn't end there. Even when I was just minding my own business, I was repeatedly harassed in and out of school. People that I didn't even know regularly shouted more ""jokes"" at me, I was often followed by people who were visibly laughing at me. It was bullying, but was on a grand scale. Literally the entire school was in on it. Everyone. Even my friends helped M with his ""campaign"" rather than supporting me. They just saw it as a joke. The worst part was that it happened to my girlfriend as well, but luckily she was tougher than me and the words didn't affect her as much. I pretended to act the same in front of her so she didn't worry, but I was on the verge of breaking down for most of my days during the campaign period. 

Finally it was voting day. After over a week of hell, I didn't care about winning anymore. Everyone knew that a popular kid was going to win anyway. I just wanted the vote to take place, and then the harassment would finally stop. Everyone voted, and the winner was announced the day after. Everyone - myself included - knew that one of the candidates with more friends would win. But guess what?

M won.

He got over 2/3 of the votes, landslide victory with nobody coming close. Even he seemed surprised at this. Over 2/3 of people in my school voted to vote for an individual that dedicated his whole campaign, his whole identity to putting me down at every opportunity. What does that say about the people in my school? What does it say about me? It felt like some kind of fucked up joke. Every year one of the popular kids would win, and it would've took a miracle for that to change. What miracle was that? Weeks of hard work, passion and determination? Of course not. It took no effort or care at all. All it took was for someone to bully, humiliate and undermine me at every chance, and the people at my school loved it. They loved it.

After the results, I am still harassed because of M despite thinking it would end. I don't see it ending in the foreseeable future, and I am left to feel like that scared, hopeless 12 year old that I had been trying to move away from. Meanwhile M has gained dozens of friends and is universally liked, sort of a class clown. Overall, I feel like I am back at square one, and it's going to take a lot of time before I am back to being that person I was before I signed up for the Student Union Election.

So that is my story. I'm just going to end it on an observation I have made regarding many of my bullies over the years. Every single person who took pride in humiliating, belittling, attacking me: every single one of them socially benefited from it. They gained friends who were impressed by how hilarious it was that they were joking at my expense, majorly grew in confidence, and they are still experiencing these benefits today. They are still with the same friends they made because of me. I think my story is a shining example of this on a massive scale, and it still makes me wonder why this happens.

Thank you for reading if you've made it this far. Please feel free to comment to share similar experiences or to discuss the things I covered. I could also use some support. Thanks again."

Add to this that im adopted and here the people are pretty close minded, so yea, you got a perfect theatre. 
During middle school (6th 7th 8th grade for yall 'muricans) i was an outcast. I only had 3 friends in class all of them studied an instrument at school (important later) during summer vacation 10 guys were failed 8th grade so being too many the headmaster made up a new class: musical class. It was hell, being alone in a class where everyone hates you is difficult, nobody stands on your side being insulted in loop, we were so desperate that the school bully beaten up a prof ON THE SCHOOL GROUND. I began to  selfharm hoping that one of those cut would be my last. More than one time thing got phisical one time they tried to drown me... in the school  bathroom. I never told anyone of my experience. I thought more than one time to end the pain. But during high school i made friends that never abandoned me even when i started studying abroad o when i transferred to Berlin. I'm happy now, and one of the things that I am most proud of is the fact that i made it through the years and that the last time I was visiting my parents for Christmas i saw one my ex bully, who i know was struggling with remorse, look at her in the eyes wispered in her ear "" i forgave you a long time ago when you felt sorry for what you did, why can't you just forgave yourself? She was very thankful and said that she admires me. That if she was in my situation she would never forgave herself

(For example, I've heard numerous incidents where the bully goes running to the teachers the minute their target fights back, no matter how violent the bully was in the first place. In addition, I find the popular kids were always side-eyeing you, but you ignoring them was equivalent to giving them death stares and they'd proceed to feign being hurt etc.)

Please share if you have experienced instances of this. Let's all re-remind everyone who has been or is being bullied of how truly pathetic bullies are, and consequently how much better we all are than those who bully us especially in terms of personality and strength.

&#x200B;

I'll start everyone off: Being the 'weird kid in high school and very much an individual made being bullied by the stereotypical 'cool' kids inevitable. They engaged in the usual behaviour e.g. spreading rumours, stealing my stuff, hitting and throwing things at me, telling me to kill myself etc. In the first two years they'd throw paper balls at me whenever they thought the teacher wasn't looking, but would always burst into tears whenever the teacher caught them and even claim those paper balls were thrown 'by accident'. One even threw a full on tantrum on the spot in one instance and then had the nerve to drag her parents down to school claiming the teacher who had scolded them had 'abused her'

Over the years they also got tired of the fact their bullying wasn't having the intended effect on me, and so started turning on each other instead . Unfortunately it was clear they couldn't take being on the receiving end of what they had previously dealt me: By the end of high school, one of the queen bees in that group broke down mentally from all the cattiness and had to be treated for depression after apparently attempting suicide (she dropped out of school for 2 years), and our graduating class had to have two separate Leaver's Balls (UK equivalent of prom) due to the bitter conflicts going on in that group."

However, for the past 2 months or so, his grades and morale have been steadily dropping to the point where the school called my father about it, and when my brother was questioned about the situation he broke down crying and let spill. There's a group of 6 junior hicks that are not only bullying him at school but are following him to lunch, like the other day when they followed him to a gas station and shoulder tapped him, and then proceeded to slam his head against the wall.

I have problems with focusing and i know why. i have ADHD but that's not it.

I am a high school student and i have problems with my social life i get bullied every day and thats my fall almost my whole grade thinks im weird and a kid nobody wants to hang around. Sometimes i get the chance to listen to music in class and for some reason when i block out everything life gets easier and not problems and no troubles. then when i have to take them off life just comes back and does everything in its power to make me feel worse. im a kid that enjoys games and tech things but just when i think im happy something bad always happens for example im doing work being happy and all then a bully slams my computer shut and starts making me feel worse and i just take it.

One day i got tired of all the abuse so i threatened a kid with a knife because i was so angry and all that pain and fear just bursted out. I got suspended the next day and i regret doing it i just wanted to the the kid in the corner that nobody notices i felt disappointed in myself. 2 years later i still get the abuse and im thinking of moving schools but i tend to cling on to what i have left. i tend to be afraid of what people will do. i was in a relationship with a girl but it was hardly a relationship. I was used for popularity then i broke up because i was tired of being an entity i was tired of being a toy just for everyone to abuse. I hate life i have mental problems because what my life has become and im just done.

Life is torture..

Me - You already know

Bro - Brother

B1 etc - Bullies

So, my brother is claustrophobic and he has anxiety. Unfortunately, some bullies at his school take advantage of this, and trap him in fight spaces until he passes out. It has been happening for 3 years now, and he's been to scared to tell any of us. Eventually, he told me, but made me promise not to tell our parents.

We went to the park the following day, and sursprise, surprise the bullies were there. Now in my last post, I said I was passifist, but I was pissed. This boy was a full foot taller than me, And I still managed to reach up there I punch him in the nose, and I've started lifting. So yeah, these guys were royally f*cked.

B1 - ~He takes a swing and kisses by a long shot, leaving his d*ck open for a nice kick~ One down, two to go.
Bro - ""Just leave them!""
Me - ~Punches the group midget in the neck~
One more guy to go.
Then I hear crying...

My brother was sat there on the floor, having an anxiety attack because he thought they could kill me. I went to tend to hik, leaving myself open for a punch, which rather than hitting me, not my brother, knocking him out cold. I snapped, like really snapped. I grabbed the largest rock I could see and proceeded to smash the ever living sh*t out of his shoulder. After I was done with that a$$hole, I took my brother home, and he had to go to hospital, but he's good now.

Oh, and those c*cksuckers didn't bully him today either, so I think he may be bully free. All because of a p*ssed off brother."

So, I’m just tired of being bullied, even if it is online. It hurts so much. I’m tired of getting called ugly, I’m tired of getting called dumb. I even say to stop and they don’t. Even if I apologize to them it still continues. It makes me so suicidal, but they don’t care. They made me self harm, but, they still don’t care. 

It’s even worse when they want my parents to abuse me, when they laugh about my trauma. I know I’ve done bad in the past but I changed, but really? Telling me I deserve to get abused? Even I wouldn’t wish that upon someone.

I feel like I can tell nobody about it because they’ll just laugh and call me weak. Well I’m sorry words hurt me, I’m sorry I take things seriously than others. That “jokes” make me cry.  

I just want it to stop, but I know changing myself for them won’t do anything good. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so worthless, like everyone would be better without me."

She was an older girl. She inserted herself into my life slowly like laughing at my jokes butting into conversations responding to stuff to talk to me or laughing. Asking me to repeat stuff to her then wait for me after class to scare me after we talk. I met her because she laughed long and hard at a bad joke I made then asked me to repeat it to her then after I talked to her waited after class for me to pop out say boo.She began finding any way to talk to me. While talking got red made no eye contact and smiled while hiding her face. Blushed around me. We’d joke around and tease each other a game between us. Her friends acted funny. Her friend pushed me to her. Her friend would ask me to be around them and find any excuse for me to, when her friend sat between us and talked to me and flirted with me she didn't seem to happy had an attitude. She wanted to be next to me and didn't want her friend between us in pictures. We started taking selfies and she'd want me to get close to her for all. She sent me the picture so I could post she would like it then tell me in person. She would approach me with her friend and her friend would just push me to her, if I ignored them or walked away they would follow me and just continue trying to talk to me. She got dressed up and her friend came and got me for a selfie with her. She found any way to talk to me and compliment me. Hover around me and try to talk to me, approaching me with her friends help.When I was minding my own business she would giggle say my name. Do it when I looked at her. Blush when I say hi. She liked a picture with my dad tagged in it to then tell me she likes it, so she can show up on both our notifications. While talking held never ending eye contact and smiled not stopping in silence. I'd break eye contact and she continues standing in front of me staring at me. She found out info about me to tell me. When I talked to her tried to scare me or take a selfie with me. Stare at me every chance. She showered me with so much flattery and attention. But the thing is, she never left me alone. She began butting in intensely when I talk to other people, especially girls and she would just start laughing loudly, butt in respond ask questions. I made a joke about moving out of town and she had some issue with me she stopped talking to me. Her friend told me I hurt her feelings. She continued staring at me and stuff but not anywhere near as happy. Then when I was talking to another guy she started screaming at me out of nowhere and calling me names attacking me. Her best friend would look at her and say her name when I enter a room. The thing is she never stopped, when I ignored her she would continue giggle and say my name when I said something bad. Say my name when I talked about something bad. Continue trying to butt into my conversations. She just never left me alone and didnt stop flirting with me. Say my name like bossing me around when I talk about something bad. I would just talk about height and weight to someone else and she said ""Nobody else is as big as you"". Her Friend would go around finding information about me then tell her and she told me everything she heard. She just never stops flirting and just so aggressive and when I ignore or just don't do anything she continues. Its like she would reward me if I talk to her by flirting with me, waiting for me after class to scare me or selfies and all her compliments.

As I got older and saw her around she went to a place with a clear view staring at me. I saw her at her work and she did that. I went to her work once and she saw me said hi, was in one spot then moved to another that was a clear view she could see me in and I could see her and she stayed there the whole time and stared. Then I saw her in a car. I stared at her not knowing it was her because she was laughing loudly. She looked over at me she held eye contact and stared back at me, when I broke eye contact didn't stop and watched me leave. She did this when my mom was right next to me. I broke eye contact and didn't look back. She didn't like that. Months later her and her mom go back on my fb to remove their likes on a pic dedicated to my dads death. Her mom liked my dad and she obviously talked about me to them because she found out that my dad bought a motorcycle from hers. After that she had an attitude, I worked with her, she stared at me while putting on a jacket and didn't stop when caught and the supervisor said something and she was shocked.

Well now we go to the same college she saw me when shes walking into her class and I was leaving that class she was showing up on time and sat down stared at me when I wasn't looking for a few seconds. Now after seeing me shows up 30 minutes early walks by looking in at me then walks by many times like 4+ times stands in the doorway then waits outside. Nobody does this and everyone else in her class is not there. Everyone else waits in their car between classes. Her friend acts like I don't exist when she sees me around and only went up to talk to me once. Her friend got a boyfriend and he lived right next door to me, she never said hi or anything.

I am just frustrated and upset in general because she never stops flirting with me in general and does it aggressively and when I ignore just persists and then eventually lashes out at me and does bad stuff. Then has some issue over stuff then lashes out at me. She never stops and just perists, she lashes out has an attitude over something stupid and starts up again. I get uncomfortable and ignore, she gets upset, angry and lashes me out. She showered me with so much attention, flattery and compliments. Selfies but I just can't get space or a break and when I get uncomfortable and ignore her or show negative body language/ response she just throws a fit and lashes out doing bad stuff. She acted like a supporting friend and shows support for stuff but then gets mad and take it away lashing out over that stuff. She just feels like a flirty big sister and using that dynamic to her advantage pushing me around and in a way bullying me. I just feel discouraged because I feel like she is the only female friend I really ever had. Her and her friend. Her friend would find any excuse to be around me and offered me a ride when it's unnecessary. She might know I am autistic because she is known for having a short fuse blowing up at people and she doesn't treat me that way and been extra patient wouldn't care if I interrupted her, ask questions on topics I am fixated with, instantly believe stuff I say take my side on stories when she was upset with me. Gets upset with me and then gets over it.

PS: I am autistic but on the high functioning end of the spectrum and not everyone knows it or thinks it but I struggle with social cues and such."
833,What should I do?,5,aoq7sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/aoq7sk/what_should_i_do/,2,1549726262.0,"So let me explain my current situation:

I'm 16, (about to turn 17) live in a rural town that's homophobic as fuck, and the kids are all dick heads.

I go to school everyday wishing that I was homeschooled, or not even want to go to begin with, and I get bullied, get called every name possible, faggot, retard, future school shooter, hell even the ol' class you smell.

Had a kid in my class tell me to shut up, the teacher did absolutely nothing, I want to tell the administration but from past experiences from my old school, I don't want to knowing that they'll most likely do nothing to begin with.

Update: today i stood up for myself and tried to tell the principle about a kid saying i was a school shooter, the other kid tried to twist my words and make it sound like i threatened to shoot the school, when i didn't, the police were called and even the cop stood up for me (i know him from a past experience and knows I'm doing better)

Update 2: I'm in national news now, basically be cause of this kid lying i was put in a news story which is sooo fun (Luckily they didn't have my name)

This started when i was only 9 years old, i met these girls in my apartment building.... they moved into the apartment... one door across to mine. At first, I thought they were my friends... but I thought wrong... The day i knew they weren't real friends was when they made me feel like I had no future... Things after that got worse for me... All my neighbors thought those girls were nice and perfect.. what i saw in people's eyes was hatred and a disgusted look....I felt depressed every single day...In school the word i heard from ever person i would come through would be you're ugly.....Hearing this everyday made me have fear... everytime i would be in a crowd....

836,I'm a mom and,6,amau9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/amau9z/im_a_mom_and/,10,1549111370.0,"Middle School Bitches Are Driving Me Crazy. They are former friends who dropped my daughter over the summer but didn't ""tell"" her until the first day of 8th grade. It got really bad. They didn't just stop being her friend, they were rude, ignored her, told other girls she was a ""snob"" and a ""fake friend."" (Not to be one of ""those"" mothers but my kids is one of the most genuine people you could ever know. She is very shy and it takes her a long time to open up to people. These girls knew all her secrets, she trusted them enough to confide everything in them). My kid has anxiety in general and she missed a week of school (she already struggles academically because of her anxiety disorder). She was physically ill and her pediatrician put her on antidepressants. 

I spoke to her Academic Intervention Services teacher (as all 3 are students of his) and spoke to their counselor and it was all taken care of. Things improved although my daughter was still a bit lonely. Luckily she still had some friends that are boys from her elementary school (When the 500 6th graders from our school district merge from our 5 elementary schools into our one middle school, they are then divided into 4 sections. Our elementary school is one of the smaller ones so when you get to middle school, you may not have many kids that you knew before in your new section and that's how a lot of elementary friends drift apart when they get to middle school) so she had friends to eat lunch with, sit with in class, etc. She was having a hard time not having any girl friends in her grade or section, though.

When the Musical Club started up in October, she joined up (it's her 3rd year with that) and was cast in the show. She made some new friends in the show and has been much happier lately. Even made a close enough friend to buddy up with and share a room on their Washington DC field trip in the Spring (she was REALLY worried about being placed with 3 people she didn't know if she couldn't find a friend). 

Fast forward, to tonight. It was Opening Night of the musical, she had a great time, we get home and she's been texting like a fiend for about 30 minutes, hadn't even taken her coat off. I finally looked over and saw that she looked like she was about to cry. I said, ""WHO are you texting?"" Well thing 1 and thing 2 are texting, bothering her. See thing 2 came onto the friendship of my daughter and thing 1 after a year and kind of decided that she wanted thing 1 all to herself. Thing 1 came around after the school counselor talked to the girls and said she just wanted to be friendly but not good friends anymore. Then a little while later she came back and said, ""Let's be besties again, I miss you."" Luckily my daughter was not stupid about it and said, ""It's going to take a while to get back the friendship we had but we can still talk and stuff."" I was very proud of her. 

So things have been low key until tonight. Thing 1 (kind of friend) texts and asks how opening night was. Now she's WITH Thing 2 (Miss THANG). They're just poking at her, ""Why did you let your mother call the school?"" ""I think we should just be low-key friends so don't get upset if I ignore you at school,"" and all this other bs. Made my daughter let me look at her phone. 

I've gotten the school involved once (because it was affecting my daughter's academics). When/Should I get the mothers involved? Or let the school know again? I don't want to wait until it's too late and my kid starts getting physically ill over this again. I already told my daughter if they are making you upset and asking to be sometimes friends, then they are little bitches who can go F themselves. Tell them you are over it. So she did. And she blocked them. But somehow they keep crawling back in. Text, email, snapchat, IG...so many ways to get to someone and inside their head. 

I'm just really effing frustrated right now and if you read this whole ginormous post, thank you. Words of wisdom really appreciated."
837,"I wonder if it’s because of bullying from my older brothers that I don’t trust other people, including family??",5,ajxu2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/ajxu2f/i_wonder_if_its_because_of_bullying_from_my_older/,6,1548506727.0,"I was bullied a little bit outside the home, but it really it wasn’t anything compared to the relentless teasing that my older brothers dueled out on me. 

Now, don’t get me wrong. I love my brothers. Now that we’re adults I’ve fully forgiven them for all the stuff they did when we were kids. But somehow I still find myself hesitant to reach out to them or anyone in my family for that matter. I’ve been going through some stuff for the past 3ish-years emotionally and psychologically as I’ve been coming to terms with how my covert narc-mom completely f*cked me up and I’ve been trying to psyche myself up to reach out to my siblings in order to get me away from her so I could fully mentally heal, but I can’t bring myself to do it. Part of the reason is that I don’t want to put them in the middle because it’s their mother too. But I’m beginning to wonder if the reason I’m so afraid of reaching out is that I really don’t trust them with this? Maybe I’m still harboring some resentment for what they did...idk. But I feel like I’m worried they’ll take her side or something, which I honestly don’t think they would because they moved out and went to live with my Dad because she was so crazy. Outside of my siblings, I don’t really have anyone else. No close friends. No Aunts or Uncles. My mom isolated me from them all. So I’m looking for some advice on how to possibly bridge the distance between me and my siblings or maybe either forgo family all together and get out on my own. 

For those of you whose bullies were in your own family, how did you deal with it? Did you manage to forgive? Or did you say forget it?"

Well, today, it hit me.  Background: I was bullied, I mean really bullied, from 4th grade up until 8th. My classmates were relentless. Verbally, physically(yes, really), mentally, and emotionally. About my appearance, lack of ability to play sports, glasses, braces, weight, and my clothes. My parents were not rich. I was not preppy. I was one of the odd ones out. Anyway, the girls in my class were catty and petty as fuck(before petty was a thing.) Well there was these 2 girls in particular. they were ""besties."" On more then one occasion, they would fight and then decide I was good enough to be their friend. But they would make me choose between them. I would make the mistake of choosing and then BAM. She would turn on. So would the other one because I didn't choose her. Voila, they were friends again and they would go back to bullying me. Why I didn't learn the first time, I don't know. There was also this group of girls who I was friends with for almost  the whole 5th grade. We bonded over over Lord of the Rings. We were best friends. Then it was wishy-washy and in 8th grade we were best friends again. We had this notebook  that we would write notes to each other in and pass it back and forth. Well, one day, they were acting weird towards me. After school, I asked one of them. She ripped a page out of the notebook and shoved it into my hands. It was a series of notes they wrote back and forth. Deciding which one would tell me that they didn't want to be my friends anymore. I went home in tears. My mom asked what was going on and I threw the note at her. She called my teacher and they talked. She talked to them. And they started acting extremely fake and I knew it was because they basically had to be nice. I didnt ask them to. I didnt ask my mom to say anything. But they would make rude ass snide comments about how I got my mom invloved. 

&#x200B;

This is just a few examples of why I have my issues. This is why I'm always worried that even though people are my friends, are they really?  Or are they pretending until they get sick of me? I hate conflict because then I worry that every party involved will hate me. I am 26 fucking years old and still worry about this shit. But when you get treated like I did, it leaves a long lasting impact. PTSD. Anxiety. All kinds of fun shit. "

I go to a private high school and I hate it so much. 

After Junior school I had about 5 best friends but none if them were goning to go to my high school. I live in a rural area so the closest school to me is a private  high school. I had 1 friend that was gonna come with me but he failed and had to reapet the last year of junior school. So I went to gr 8 by myself. 

In gr 8 I was very shy (still am) no one talked to me first. Expect for this one kid lets call him Adam. Adam was nice at first but some kids from his junior school told me he was a crybaby and whould cry and lie to the teacher to get someone he did not like. I didn't beilve this at first but I saw it with my eyes when he lied about a kid swearing to him and that kid got DT. I know he was an asshole and I tryed ti get away from him. In my grade there were only 22 boys for me to interact with and most of them were those assholes who acted like children and said stuip stuff. About 25% were nice people who enjoyed stuff that I liked and could talk to.

Everything was fine until the end of the year. I was in the chess team and one day I skiped a match and the next class I had with that teacher she gave yelled at me in class and gave me DT( I am sarced of getting DT because noone in my family has ever gotten one and I'm never scared to disappoint my parents if I get one thats why im a goody too shoes basically and I like being one) I started crying in class and stopped. Then thus one kid named lets call me BJ( his nickname was Bkack Jesus because all the black kids in my grade would follow him around and do what he says) he was laughing his ass off and i got very angry and punched the desk next to me and yelled BJ ran out the class after that. After that everyone nicknamed me the Hulk and said that I got angry in class and fliped the desk. I hated that so much everyone called me the Hulk, I eventually stoped talking unless someone talked to me. The teacher who gave me DT revoked it as she felt pity for me.

Near the end of the year another think happend I was in English class and cleaning the white board then someone throw a paper airplane at me and it hit me in the face. I got angry grabbed the plane and the other that guy made and throw them in the classes bin. Then BJ yelled here comes the hulk I got angry and screamed at him. 

The next day I was called in and told the teacher most of what i have written now. BJ was suspensed for a week and the teacher talked to the grade and no called me hulk again for a while. 

But that made things worse noone would speak to me anymore expect Adam and I stopped talking all together and felt very lonely. My old friends new really responed to my messages and I gave up talking to them for a while. I felt like killing myself because I felt so lonely. I was gonna do it if at the end of that year nothing went for me. Then I met her lets called her Rosie she was in her second last year of high school and one day I was sitting by myself in class and she sat next to me and we stared talking it felt so good to talk to someone again. After that day she would just say hi or hey to me in the halls it felt so good for someone to just to say something to me. 

That was my first year of high school.

The next year I was in grade 9 my old friends were sometimes talking to me again it felt so good again. In gr 9 I wanted to become a prefect at my school so I could have a shield from the bullying. I tryed to get everyone to like me from then. Rosie was still saying hi or hey or how are you to me and it felt so nice.

The major thing that was terrible. Just before my grade was to go on a camp. The boys were getting dressed in the bathroom for PE and Adam took his shirt off funny and everone laughed. This one kid lets call him Mark then mocked him then BJ came in the bathroom and said ""What's so funny is there a gangbang in here or something!"". I felt after that. The day we were to go on camp I was called in by the headmaster and another guy who was not there lets call him Dave. Adam had sent a note saying that Mark and BJ were gonna rape him! (No I swear on my life this actually happened) and he named us as witnesses. I said that I left aftet BJ was there and Dave was not getting dressed in the bathroom that day. We went to the camp the next period. At camp everyone thought i took Adams side and i was bullied really badly at camp. A guy lets call himnamed Dan and another guy named Adam but he was fat put laxatives in my coffee and for the first night my was shitting my guts out and could not get out of bed the next day. I blocked the toilet and the whole of my dorm was calling me names and saying I was full of shit. The next night BJ's new iphone was missing and he said that someone had stolen it so he made everyone looking in there bags. They were watching me the most. It was later it was found under Dave's bag but Dan saw Adam put the phone under the bag. So Adam was getting shit. After camp i was called again to the headmaster. I told him I was in the bathroom but was not there when BJ said gangbang. I was beilved after that Mark and Adam were called in. The next day Mark came up to me and hugged me and thanked me. He then told me that Adam tried to pin the whole thing on me. By saying that I started the whole thing. The asshole boys were starting to talk to me and some of them weren't that bad. Adam got scott free though his mom is that bitch mom meme that would sue the school for nothing. She was also banned from school grounds for a year. BJ also left the school after this and is now trying to become a rapper.

At the end of the year Rosie was leaving school and going to the UK. I gave he a note thanking her and told her about wanting to kill myself. Next time i saw her she hugged me and gave me her phone num. We talked for sometime until she went to the UK.

End of my second year.

My third year of high school was not that bad. I stopped talking to Adam. Even when I had extra maths lessons with me with the same teacher. 

I was making friends with some of the asshole boys. Just need to find a common interest and thens happen.Rosie started talking to me again on Instagram that was really nice. 

Only 2 major things happended: I called Fat Adam a caveman because he was banging a bottle on a wall for like 5 mins. He hated me after that. The next was there was a social happening at my school and I invited my friend Kyle to join me he was my best friend since i was 8. So at the social Adam was there with his friend Axle who was best friends with Kyle at his high school. So Kyle went with them for the whole evening and I was alone. After that I found out they were fast friends and were texting with each other.

End of third year of high school.

This year was the bad one. I was in the asshole group but they didn't think me to be one of them Dan and Fat Adam were the ring learders. There was a texing group that I was not allowed to be apart of. I felt like i was not allowed to speaking unless they spoke to me or else I was made fun of. Most nice guys in my grade left the school. So i had to be apart of this group. I could not hang out with the girls or everyone would call me gay. There were even a list of girls the asshole group was not allowed to talk to. Fast forward a few months and the assholes were talking about that happened to him in gr8 i came up and Fat Adam started calling me the hulk I got upset and punched the wall next to me. I then stated to bleed on my hand. Fat Adam littery fall on his ass and started to crying he was laughing so much. He that I made him luagh so much because i was such a retard. I still barely speak after this again.

The next month Kyle invited me to his birthday party. When I got there fucking Adam was there I was very upset and left the party early. When I left I told Kyle that Adam was one of the people who bullied me. Kyle didn't believe me.

A gym virgin active was built and all of the asshole got memberships and started taking substances to get big. All they talk about is about getting buff and if I am there I should join ( I am overweight but both my parents are unemployed so there is no money for me to go) i tell me this, they don't believe me and 2 of the assholes start to punch me and actually bruise me on my arms. It really pisses me off but can't get angry or get bullied. 

The time has come everyone votes for prefects. Everyone says they will vote for me this makes me very happy to know that. When the time comes to see who is a prefect. My name is not called. I started to cry everyone starts to laugh. I get room and don't leave room for the whole night. Friend who is in text group who I play Magic with tells ne that some of the assholes did that just to see my face. I feel like I'm no longer human. The prefects are just popular bitch girls and asshole boys. Get bullied my prefects they allways tell me to correct my uniform. 

A week later teachers give a speech on how they are watching the kids and they could still be a prefect. Get hopefully again.

Next week I am invited to a BBQ, I go the guy who invited me i will call me Even. I get there Fat Adam is there he screams at me as a gretting. A prefect is also there. All of them but me were vaping the whole time. They also have alcohol but I only asked about it and they drank it, the next day at school Fat Adam telks everyone that I was an alcoholic at school. I tryed to defend myself but i got mad and calked hin a fat piece of shit. Fat Adam got pissed and i backed down because he looked like he was gooba start a fight with me.    Everyone beilves him I feel bad again. 

A bit later in the year we go to a down syndrome place to see how they live. Even and Fat Adam were vaping in the bathroom there. Karma caught up with Fat Adam because a person with down syndrome grabed his dick when he got close to him(this actually happened). When we were going back to school the bus stopped at a KFC and the girls went to buy ice cream. I
The boys were in the bus and Fat Adam vaped in the bus and we all had to get out. When we got back to school all the boy prefects went and vaped in the schools bathroom.

End of high school year 4

I still feeling like human trash at school and don't speak to much. I also wake up sometimes and feel like there is no point in getting out of bed. I also feel like i have no true friends at school. My time at school has made me so shy outside of school i struggle to speak to people and smile strangely. Rosie stoped replaying to my insta pms about 2 months ago. I don't believe things will change because if I tell the school the assholes won't get punished and I'll end up alone. I don't even want to go to my prom next year because I feel like I'll just get bullied if i go. I can't leave the school because my parents have already paid and school doesn't give refunds.

What do you think about my high school life Reddit. Actually writing this has made me feel happy again because I could not tell anyone about my pain. I might have to delete this as the asshole check my phone after i go back to school soon.

I hadn't spoke to my ex since she got her new boyfriend. To say the least she is a very manipulative person and so whenever I confront her about what she is doing she always goes to him and says that I am being horrible to her and shouting and what not so then he comes up to me and starts threatening me.

Now here is the funny part, the boyfriend has absolutely ZERO problem with me, he has said this to one of my close friends, and the only reason he does it is because it makes the ex happy.

What should I do? I have stood up for myself in front of both of them and I have asked them to leave me alone but they have both continued and I am starting to get really upset about it and so is my girlfriend

But her girlfriend wrote on Twitter ""That dude wrote a 12 page google document and I am deceased lmao."" and then her girlfriend sent me the message telling me to ""Die."" and that she wishes I was dead and to ""get it through my head"" that I'm the ""bad guy"" and she copy and pasted the phrases ""You're a terrible person."" and ""You're a bad person."" to me multiple times.

&#x200B;

People kept telling me to get in touch with someone that's close to her and ask them to ask her to take down the screenshots of me.  So I tried talking to one of her twitter friends last week, but then her girlfriend messaged me about it and I deleted that account instantly, and then her girlfriend wrote on Twitter that she had to go out of her way to stop someone that's ""known for harassing her friends"" as in me. But I never meant to harass anyone.

&#x200B;

I'm moving out and I really wish the person would take down the screenshots of me from her Twitter.  Everyone online tells me that I can't control that and that there's nothing I can do that and that she's never going to take down the screenshots so don't even try anything.  But I really wish that she would take down the out of context screenshots of me from her Twitter.  The trolls/haters that follow me around have threatened to link to people the tweets about me so that I'll lose all my support when I release my app that's dedicated to helping out people that feel anxious or depressed or lonely.

&#x200B;

And the person that told me to ""Die."" and stuff is a very cool, awesome, pure-hearted person that keeps saying kind words on her tumblr/twitter like that she wants everyone to have a nice day and she loves drawing stuff for people and she loves Grass Pokemon and Pokemon Snap and other stuff that I like.  It hurts that she thinks of me so badly but I can see why and well.. I just really wish they would take down the screenshots of me!  Her girlfriend told me that she told her to leave the screenshots up, so that everyone can see that I'm a horrible person.  But I really wish they'd take it down.. I did learn from everything.."

856,Adults bullying 8 year old!,6,9p8xkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9p8xkd/adults_bullying_8_year_old/,6,1539895594.0,"How am I supposed to handle one single adult that has gotten a large group of adults to BULLY my 8 year old daughter?!
DETAILS:
We own our home and new neighbors (renters) moved in about a year and a half ago (May 2017) with two children (girl same age as my daughter and boy a year older). We were very excited that the kids could play together and became fast friends with the parents also.

The kids got along great and had several disagreements but over very small things just like all kids do (is. one wants to play hide and seek and the other wants to play on tablet) but they always resolved things. 

As adults, we also got along great and our friendship grew. They have one car and she homeschools so my husband and I let them borrow a car often when they needed one. We went to family events together and planned parties together. I helped out when she was ill and her husband had to work by feeding her children and letting them play at my house while she recovered (several times). We took them up to the mountains for her birthday/Thanksgiving. And much more.

My husband and I really enjoy giving if we can and seeing others happy so we did a lot for them because we saw the need and were able and available to help many times.

In return, we didn’t ask for much. She watched our daughter a few times for short periods of time and house sat when we were gone from home for a long weekend. We took turns planning a few dinners and we hosted game nights.

At the beginning of summer is when things shifted. My daughter all of a sudden stared lying about things she had never done before. She said that the neighbor’s daughter made her fall. I confronted the other little girl and told the mom and because the mom claims her daughter would never do that, I believed her, especially when she confessed that my daughter had blatantly lied to her as well. 

Long story short: she built up quite the case against my daughter making my husband and I resent our daughter in the end.

Mid summer, she had asked if I wanted them to get pizza for my birthday which I wasn’t planning on doing anything but I though it to be a nice gesture so I said yes. On my birthday, a conversation between myself and her husband about pizza delivery vs carry-out somehow confuses them into thinking I was ordering pizza. (This is over pizza so I know it’s absolutely ridiculous!) I have ordered pizza for all of us many times and I certainly would have if I said I would. The pizza was never ordered and we all went in early that evening. 

No word from anyone for a week, I though a break for the kids was a good thing but was very confused so I confronted my friend to see what’s going on. 

(This is where my mind got f^€!#£ blown!)

She tells me she did think the kids needed a little break and the silence was over PIZZA!!!! She continues to tell me yet another scenario where my daughter lied to her and she thinks that it’s becoming a big problem and as my friend she suggested that I have my kid see a professional. She continues, and claims nobody on our street likes my husband and that one of the neighbors has a restraining order on him. This completely shocked me! I was speechless and told her at the moment that I appreciate her honesty and that I would have to see what I have to do next. (My husband works very hard and long hours so he doesn’t really socialize with the neighbors as much as I do. His sense of humor is very dry and no one seemed to mind for the many years we’ve had all our other neighbors.)

I take this information to my husband and he is just as shocked as I am! (Owning his own business, he cannot have any legal orders against him, so a restraining order would put him out of business)

A couple days later her husband come over to “smooth things over”. Which I was glad as the tension on our street was really growing. He mentions that she had a history of blaming another man for harassing her and that to this day, he didn’t believe her. So my response was “How can I trust her again? She’s doing exactly what she has been accusing my daughter of doing!” The conversation ended well and my husband and I both thought things would get resolved or at least just cut into that tension. 

That was the last time we spoke! The next day, they had a party with about 10 of our neighbors where they all completely ignored us and our daughter. Their kids and neighbors’ kids are not allowed near our daughter to this day. 

My husband and I had to sincerely apologize to our daughter for making her think she was lying and not knowing it. The guilt we feel for doing that is tremendous. She’s a kind girl and would never want to harm anyone on purpose. For a single child, she care very much about others. She sees the other children playing outside and is being left out so that hurts her and as a parent, I try my best to help her through it. The neighbors have planted many kid friendly activities and invited more kids from the neighborhood but not our daughter. When she’s outside playing, and my neighbor walks by, she stares at her without a word. (My daughter isn’t allowed to speak to them either) However, if the other kids are out and I say hello, they get excited and sneak up to say hello back and tell me and my daughter about the newest game they are playing. All rushed and shushed. 

We do have cameras and can see all their activities and more importantly, can safely see our daughter playing outside. 

My daughter is constantly getting hurt by this situation! What do I do other than hide in my house or move away since neither is an option?!"
857,My bullying experience,5,9myssy,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9myssy/my_bullying_experience/,4,1539201532.0,"I live in Geochang,South Korea. Im 23yo male and I was bullied 2004~2011. If you search my name you can see it.


In 2009 there was this 'Iljin'(Bully whose at upper hirarchy than others) named Choi Junhyeok in Geochang middle school. He is shotputter and 15cm taller and bigger than average and confident in bullying way. One day at school 'bullying inspection' period it was reported he forced his victim to eat wasted Jjujjuba(tubed icecream). He was scolded by teacher and that was it


Just after school finished and teacher is gone, he walked in front of class and said loudly confidently 'Dont go home and sit'. Because of fear of retaliation everyone complied. He then asked one by one 'Did you report?' and let them go. I was kind of last. so It was highly likely that he would suspect me as reporter.(Although I didnt, I think Its not that wrong to report it nowadays). I remember being terrified because of him being shotputter and big. Luckily I wasnt suspected and went home.


He wasnt able to catch reporter but at least to me that was declaration that he was stronger than teachers.


In 2010 at same school Bully named Yim Wooyeong forced me to do 'Gimajase' during class while teacher is watching. The teacher at that class was being harassed by some group of students. She saw it but continued on class. I think she gave up on protecting victim.


In 2011 It was talked Iljin named Pyo Juyong of my class dragged victim also of my class to backside of school afterschool and beat him long and broadcasted it via smartphone app. Whether its true or not, designated teacher of my class said to PyoJuyong 'Hey dont broadcast it okay?'. To me it was like she was telling him it was okay to beat victim."
858,Being Bullied at Work,3,9iebhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/9iebhg/being_bullied_at_work/,13,1537785419.0,"I am using a throwaway account. 

I had to move and quit my old job when my husband got a transfer. I was happy with the move and got a job in Feb 2018 at this family run business. I won't say which industry because it's very niche but it's in manufacturing and highly male dominated. I am the only woman here, save for our HR lady who is also accounting. She works remotely but is in the office on Mondays and Fridays. We're all super casual in our interactions with each other, which I have never really experienced. There's a lot of banter and locker room talk. I thought nothing about it when I first joined. I gave out my personal phone number to make sure I was looped in and could facilitate work whilst people were off property. 

This one guy started to text me inappropriate messages. Like about what a cute ass I have and how he wants to get drunk with me and touch me. I responded by saying that I am not that kind of woman. The next day was awkward for me. But I pushed past it. He never apologized. He never said I am sorry I was drunk ect.ect. I let it go. I was new I didn't want my boss thinking that I was pulling a ""me too moment"". I thought I'd be told, ""grow a callous, or quit."" 

He emailed me on work email, taunting me, asking me if I'd drop a pen and pick it up slowly.

He started calling me, on the weekends, drunk. My husband told me I need to report this shit. But I kept quiet thinking I was stirring the pot at the least or getting someone fired at the worst.

He'd ask me what I was wearing and asked for pictures. I was mortified. But kept it civil and told him no repeatedly. I ended up blocking him. He never brought up the fact I never picked up the phone, or his messages were going unanswered. I thought my problems were solved.

This past Thursday he was ""sick"" (which means he was binge drinking tge night before) so I unblocked him on my phone to help him get his work done. Things were all business until he called me at 6pm (I was still at work) and proceeded to drunkenly berate me. He called me stupid. He told me that I was a tease. He told me he hated me. My voice, my clothes, my face. He called me a sandn*gger. He told me I'd never amount to anything. I hung up and broke down sobbing. 

One of the guys came out of their office (I thought I was alone and I had him on speaker) handed me a tissue and asked if I was okay to drive home. I tearfully nodded gathered my shit up and left for the night. I emailed my boss that evening and requested a closed door meeting with HR present. 

He called out sick on Friday again. I assume from the massive hangover he had. I printed out the emails and text messages. Armed with dozens of examples, of him saying nasty, horrible things to me on work email and text. I proceeded to tearfully explain my last six months of hell. I was so ashamed and scared. I fear retaliation. I am scared he'd get angry and throttle me. They both stared at me in horror as I unloaded all of this. I produced the emails/texts and they went silent, wide eyed, silent. 

My boss spluttered, ""He's a married man...with four daughters...how could he be so cruel."" Human Resources lady had tears in her eyes and said nothing.

I was asked to stay home (with pay) on Monday so they could sort things out. But I still feel so scared. I don't want him to get fired. I don't want him to lose his livelihood. I do want him to seek help maybe rehab or even therapy. But I don't know how I'll face the office on Tuesday.

I’ve always hated school. Everything about it. I honestly can’t recall a single good school memory in my last 9 years of pubic (and private) education. I hate the classes, I hate the teachers, I hate lunch, but most of all I always hated the other students. I hated being bullied in and off from 4th grade all the way to Sophomore year. I was a shy awkward kid so I guess it made me an easy target? The only other kids I didn’t hate were the few friends I had. I left the district to go to a private Catholic school after 8th grade, but I came back because I hated that school too. The worst part is that every single year, I would always pray that next year would be different. But no, it always got worse. I spent Freshman and Sophomore year at the catholic school, and then returned to my original district for Junior year. The first 2 days were ok. On the third day, I go to sit with my friends at a table in the cafeteria, and this one kid John tells me to get the fuck out. I ask why, and he just starts threatening me. Meanwhile my friends were laughing while I was being ridiculed and threatened in front of them. 

I left the table, and this guy continued to shout at me as I walked away. I ate lunch alone almost the entire year. It wasn’t even the asshole who kicked me off the lunch table that got to me. It was the fact that friends, who I’ve known since elementary school, sat there and did fuck all to help me. I didn’t talk to them for the rest of the year, and they didn’t talk to me. I still haven’t forgiven them. Senior year has been just as shitty. Still eating lunch alone rn."

864,How to deal with bullies in a federal work environment?,5,98c4ma,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/98c4ma/how_to_deal_with_bullies_in_a_federal_work/,36,1534631944.0,"We have not 1, but 2 bullies in our service who act in unison.  They both appear to take great pleasure in degrading and emotionally damaging our co-workers.  A couple weeks back between them they managed to break down 4 different people to tears.  In a single week.  We're mostly highly-educated professionals (I'm doing my best to be intentionally vague so as to avoid identifying my agency), but the toxicity of our workplace is bad enough that people are depressed,  losing sleep, crying at work, developing ulcers and other health problems, etc., and I know of 1 that has actively reported contemplating suicide.

The bullying is a daily affair.  They mess with people's lunches, throw away people's food, and have driven our interns to tears.  They have loud theatrical conversations outside people's offices for the purpose of insulting the people in those offices daily.  I am the only Veteran in our department, and they have repeatedly accused me in signed formal statements having perpetrated acts of violence, or having threatened them with violence.  They feed off and encourage each other in their behavior, and whenever confronted, back each other up on signed statements with lies printed on our agency letterhead, accusing their victims of wrong-doing, claiming that they themselves are the victims (one is gay, and in each complaint against them, claims that the complainant is bigoted against them because of this, which is untrue in every case I'm aware of personally).  

They both do about as little work as possible, yet collect some of the highest pay and benefit levels for their positions that are attainable in the federal system.

At least 4 members of our service have been the EEO.  We've gone to our supervisor (we've had 8 supervisors in 8 years, and we're about to get another -- each one states something along the lines of ""We need to document this before I can take action,"" and then it's rinse / repeat when the new supervisor come along).  A few of us have gone to HR.  We've reported the problem to the union.  We're encouraged to continue documenting the problems as they occur, but the acts of hostility are so frequent, that documenting them is taking us away from our actual jobs.

We've documented the details, the major interactions, so our supervisor knows what's going on, but when we go over the problems with our supervisor, they remind us that they can't discuss what steps are being taken.  But the behavior is only driven underground.  Before they go to mess with someone, now one of them walks the halls to see if there are witnesses nearby, and when it's clear, they begin.  It's always the victim's word against theirs, and as far as we can tell, our senior management aren't going to risk actually firing them because they've both made it clear that they'll sue, and management appears to regard the highly-trained professionals of our service as expendable.

We are regularly losing skilled, high-performing members of our service to bad behavior, and nothing is done to the malefactors.  We are convinced that this has gone on for so long, that someone must go.  

We've had several suicides at our location in recent years, and I am coming to believe that no action will be taken on this.  These people do not appear to feel that anything they do will result in them facing any serious loss, and my people are losing hope that the situation will ever improve.

I think about the long-term effects of this environment; our poor health and stress, of course, but also the degradation of the services we provide to the taxpayers.  We are supposed to confront and report waste, fraud, and abuse at every turn, but the toxicity of our work environment undermines everything we do.  I went to our in-house Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and spoke with a counselor, but the primary avenue of action that they suggested is that I go to HR and request a change of assignment.  So I would be leaving all the workplace friends I've had for the years I've been with the service because our management refuses to police bad behavior, seeming out of fear that they themselves might be sued.

Any suggestions?  The only thing I can think of at this point is the IG, but that's kind of a career-killer, whatever is said to the contrary. 

TLDR: We're federal and our bullies know how to game the system, and the actions taken by our chain of command only serve to drive the overt behaviors underground, but if anything, things are worse than ever."

despite this happening years ago, I still feel hurt about the situation and I get triggered when I see bullying on tv or in movies, especially when people get swirlies. I just lose my shit and I don't know how to get over it. and most of these kids are still present in my life. I see them around and most of them are going to attend the same college as me..

I have so much anxiety now and I can't shake it

 Any advice?

Some will use bullies to keep their students, workers or constituents in line. Others believe that it's not their responsibility to interfere in the interpersonal politics within their organization. Others still are bound by red tape and bureaucracy. Some are simply ignorant of the devastating and far-reaching effects of bullying. 

What it boils down to is a lack of consensus. Repeatedly science and evidence will be ignored in favor of more traditional belief systems. In matters of personal choice, freedom of thought and other such matters this is of no consequence. When it comes to bullying we simply don't have that luxury. 

Today at work I had an apprentice who has been so beaten down that he couldn't trust himself to make a simple decision. He tried to hand his will over to my authority and it broke my heart to see what has been done to him. The same has been done to me and so many others. I know exactly what the history of his situation is too. Since he first began working for this company people have speculated on whether or not he's retarded because of some of the mistakes he's made. Fortunately, when he went to school he encountered the person who saved me from those kind of allegations. He received encouragement, motivation and support while in apprentice school. It is a crime that he has proven himself there and has since had to return to a hostile work environment to have all of the progress he's made destroyed. It makes me feel great anger and sorrow. I also feel ashamed for being a part of an industry that considers this normal thereby encouraging deplorable acts of aggression, violence, gaslighting, and manipulation. It's an epidemic in my industry. I fight against it one day at a time, one person at a time by reminding them of who they really are. I build people up and give them what they need to succeed. That's how it should be. That isn't how it is. 

Bullying does not make a person stronger or more capable. It doesn't teach them a lesson about how to behave in society. It teaches you to fear bullies and to submit to their aggression in order to preserve what little part of yourself they allow you. The horror of that statement should resonate deeply within you. You should feel a plethora of strong emotions. This traumatizing experience people are forced to suffer through is what leads to anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse and marital problems among many other harms. 

The science is in support of what I have just stated. I urge everyone to consider bullying in the way I have just described it. It is a societal evil so banal that we have become blind to it's far-reaching and egregious harm. We lack consensus because we lack the resources to act on our own behalf. Let us fight ignorance with knowledge, fight hate with love, fight fear with hope and one day we may know an end to bullying.

Until that day, please, don't let your friends, co-workers, loved ones or any others lose themselves to the aggression of their bullies. Remind them that they are human beings and their lives have value. Remind them of how valuable their contribution is. Remind them of the power their love has in influencing others positively. Remind them that they can do incredible things when their potential isn't being preyed upon. 

Don't lash out, don't fight back. Please, I beg of you. It's a waste of effort. Let us care for one another in spite of the hatred and fear-mongering. That is the ultimate victory, save one life and you save yourself in the process. "

Okay, I am 16 and in first year high school. For years I had no friends. Last year, I went to psychologist and got treatment. Now I feel better and have some ""friends"". Before, I would be a loner and eat lunch alone. Teachers wont like me when im with my mobile pretending I was just fine.

Now, Since I had a beginning with new people and found some guys. I was diagnosed with level 1 mild asperger syndrome (No one knows except my parents and some teachers and nurses) and have social anxiety. Slowly, my friends started to find my weakness and had began to verbally abuse me. They start telling some really bad s\*\*\* to me and block me on social media and all stuff. I was wrong to trust them and reveal that ""I never had any friends,"" and they start using that whenever I have the upper hand.

They are taking advantage of me and I cannot do anything. I talked with the counselor and the psychologist really softly. I cant tell to the teachers since they think we are good friends with one another. My parents cannot really do anything about me. I give respect and yet get none. They literally take all my jokes and humor offensive even if I take theirs freely.

I just have no idea how to have friends and how to talk. I have to return as a loner and be depressed forever. I have great ambitions but really suck with social life. The worst part is I cannot ignore them since I'll meet them everyday at school in the hallway. I dont have any friends outside school and I think it will be the same there. I dont know what to do."

Everyone tells you grades matter except being an earnest student, participating in class enthusiastically, and making good grades does absolutely jackshit for getting treated decently by peers. In fact it often makes a student a target of bullying simply for doing what is allegedly the purpose of school.

It is unacceptable that students should be have to endure being insulted and outcast by many of their peers simply for doing what they're told. Nothing I can imagine can psychologically destroy a child like sending them to an environment where they have no freedom, no power but to follow instructions, and then letting them get humiliated for following those same instructions."

With that being said I am concerned that when the bullying programs started kicking in,physical aggression stopped at the exchange for passive aggression . Studies actually show that emotional pain hurts alot worse than physical. In other words,social ostracization ends up hurting people a whole lot worse than bullying. With bullying,the victim is acknowledged while treated poorly.When you are ostracized,people treat you as if you are a ghost. 

I got to grow up in a transitionary period right before the PC wars started to kick in full force.I used to get bullied in middle school until I decided to take action by fighting back. I ended up climbing the social ranks for a year or two . With time,I realized my quest for social clout was essentially over since I still carried over the bad reputation from when I was a nerd and got bullied. 

In HS the bullying switched over to emotional bullying.In a nutshell with the effeminization of men,the social dynamics changed in a way that men are now behaving more like traditional women. In other words,gossip/exclusion become the primary weapons of choice for a social bully. If the wrong person does NOT like you in that environment,they have the social clout to make it impossible for you to attend parties,make cool friends,date quality girls within the social group,ect. From my personal experience getting the silent treatment hurt much more than occasionally getting some overt insult/physical bullying.

What do you guys feel about this subject matter? I want to know if I am the only one that thinks that today's bullying is alot worse than bullying of the past(generalizing here).With the social media craze people can directly see that you were blacklisted in high school for instance.

I wake up every morning and pick outfits based on hoping it won't be something he teases me for.

I'm a 35 year old man. I feel good in my skin, I have a normal life, a job, friends and hobbies. Basically, I turned out fine. But I was bullied severely at school when I was a kid.

I assume most people here are young people or kids bullied at school. I want to share my story with everyone who was bullied to show that no matter what happens to you, hang in there, you will prevail in the end.

As a kid I was always very insecure. I was very skinny and did no sports. I was weak and was unable to defend myself physically. I was bullied every day, for 3 years. Physical class was the worst part of the week. It was on friday morning every week and the bullies would mock me for my skinniness calling me really mean names and further humiliate me because I was so frail and I sucked at physical activities. And one of them pretty much summed up my situation: ""what are you gonna do against me loser? I beat the shit out of you any day I want"". What COULD I do? There was no way I could fight them unless you'd give me a fucking flamethrower.

I'm sure most of you are familiar with the pain of waking up every day, being scared of walking through the school doors and being nervous days beforehand knowing physical class is coming up.

One day I was so desperate and angry that I decided to take action. I woke up on a friday morning earlier than my mom and sister (divorced parents, didn't see my dad much) and took my sister's hockey stick from the closet. You know, one of those wooden ones with metal inside. I was planning to go to school nice and early, walk to my bullies... and beat the fucking living shit out of them. I planned to bust their fucking heads open in front of everyone.

As I walked out the door and down our street, I looked at that hockey stick in my hand and suddenly realized... ""what the fuck am I doing this is madness! I'm actually planning to kill people what's the matter with me???"". Despite all my hatred, bitterness and anger, I was fortunately rational enough to walk back home and put the stick back. I was angry and full of hate, but I was not capable of actual evil by committing murder and I certainly didn't want to do any jail time for these sorry fucks.

I never did anything of the sort and I was too ashamed to tell anyone about the tragedy I had almost committed. The bullying went on and I just kept soaking it up.

In my early twenties, I was no longer being bullied and I had a normal social life but I was still skinny and insecure. So I picked up martial arts and started a weight lifting program. My confidence suddenly went through the roof. Even if I never had to use any martial arts ever, the confidence that comes with it changes you totally. Today, I have a healthy weight for a guy my height and I'm at peace with my own body. I still go to the gym but I ceased martial arts. I rock climb now though and I love it.

I'm an extremely rancorous person and I've had several moments where I wanted to look up those former bullies (I still remember all of their first and last names) and Mohammed Ali the fucking shit out of them in revenge but don't worry, I haven't actually done it :-)

But imagine where I would be if that morning I had used the goddamn hockey stick to hit them in the head with it. Where would I be? 

I can't even imagine how many kids must go through something similar. They get pushed to desperation and end up doing something really bad in an act of anger or sadness. And once it happens, everyone goes like ""oh my god *jaw on floor* how did this happen?"" and nobody saw it coming.

I guess my message with this whole story to you or to parents that have kids that are bullied is this: insecure kids are magnets for bullies. An insecure kid is an easy target and these pricks can sniff that out from a mile away. Those miserable fucks feed on others insecurities. First you got to find out what makes you insecure and then do whatever you must to remedy it. Find a way to live with yourself and be confident in who you are. Confidence is the most potent bully-repellent.

In many cases I believe martial arts help. Not because it teaches a kid to beat the shit out of someone, but because it gives the kid confidence. Confidence is the key and that will probably be enough so he'll never have to actually use his fighting skills. And even if it ever comes to him having to dish out a couple of punches... giving someone a black eye sure as hell beats going to jail because you kill someone with a hockey stick in a fit of rage.

I am fully aware my story will not apply to all bullying stories. I'm just telling you how I lived it. I'm convinced that if I had worked on my lack of confidence due to my scrawny appearance in my earlier years, none of the bullying would have happened. This will probably not help everyone who is being bullied right now. I realize that. But if I can help and inspire even just one bullied kid, then I think it's worth it.

First post on this subreddit but I was tinkering with an idea about how to overcome the psychological abuse of being bullied. 

Brief backstory: I was bullied in college for three years and am now suffering from social anxiety and depression post-college. I am 22 now. 

So I've been thinking a lot about how to get over the abuse of bullying and I feel like it all comes down to ultimately changing how you feel about yourself. Well you ask ""Yeah, but how?"". So today, I had a sort of epiphany and I wrote down everything that was going on in my head that the bullies said to me in college. ""You suck"", ""No one likes you"", ""You're dumb"", etc. I wrote those insults down and then right next to them I wrote the complete opposite of what the insult said:

""I am awesome"", ""I am likeable"", ""I am smart"", etc. Now you are probably wondering well that is just positive affirmations. I agree, but lets take it a step further. What if you linked the positive affirmations to a core memory from your past that you feel these statements to be true? 

For example I was very good at sports when I was in highschool. I know it to be true that I am awesome because I was good at sports. It made me feel good about myself, even awesome! So that will look differently for everyone. Some people might attach their awesomeness to being intelligent, being a good person, being athletic, etc. Now that you have attached a positive affirmation AND a positive memory, this will (hopefully) effectively reverse the traumatic experience of being bullied over time. 

I have confidence that this will work because for me, what happens in my brain when I am going throughout my day is:

1) I will be by myself just ruminating about what the bully has said/done to me. The technique described above is for this specific situation when there are no real triggers to the bullying incident. 
2) I'll be scanning for threats that will solidify my bully's opinion about me. For example, I will be looking at my co-worker's face and if he looks disgusted at me I'll immediately think ""The bully was right, people don't like me"". This one is a bit more tricky because it introduces anxiety which is harder to tackle because you have to change your behavior now as opposed to your thoughts and feelings in order to get out of the triggered zone. 

I will write a second post about situation #2 but I'd love to hear your feedback first and make sure I am not just talking nonsense. I would like some honest criticism because honestly, I hate bullying and I am just trying to find a way to be myself again. 

Thanks for the read guys hopefully it wasn't too long!

904,How to recover from the effects of bullying,6,5n3ydj,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/5n3ydj/how_to_recover_from_the_effects_of_bullying/,3,1484066360.0,"This post is not about those who are currently being bullied. This post is aimed towards those who were bullied in the past but still have trouble healing from the scars of it

So what is the key then to recover from bullying? You absolutely must stop seeing yourself as a *victim*. Instead of only focusing on the bad things that happened, try to focus on seeing how it was a **blessing in disguise**. This will help you stop seeing yourself as a **victim** at the **effect** of a **cruel, mean world**

For example, one could learn that alot of societal beliefs are total BS because if a bullied target retaliates, *he* gets blamed for being an aggressive psycho (2nd person always gets caught). Another reason I felt bitter about being bullied was that it caused women to see me as weak and unattractive. What helped me recover was to realize this *isn't a bad thing*. Many men end up as consumers spending money on crap they don't need just to impress women, many of whom just cheat and divorce them anyways. So by being the low-status bullied victim, you can weed out the superficial women who just wanted to use you. 

I was also ""forced"" to become more independent and think differently because most everyone else admires the bullies and shames the ""victims"". But this is a *blessing in disguise* because due to my low social status, I'm now **more free**. If I had higher social status, I would have to *constantly worry about protecting it*. I am free to adopt nonconformist views and opinions, realize social status and popularity are meaningless, and can boycott TV shows and movies because why should I watch the same crap everyone else watches when they didn't even have the sympathy to stand up for a distressed ""victim""? 

Another key to overcoming bitterness is to realize you didn't ""lose"" anything and the bully didn't ""win"" anything. That's because life is essentially meaningless. *It doesn't even matter* if he got to be ""winner"" and you were the ""loser"". We've been conditioned to think it's a huge deal because our society emphasizes competition so much. 

One more key is **gratitude**. Being a victim implies you see yourself as having less than others. Having gratitude is the opposite as you see yourself as having *more* than others. For example, you are fortunate enough to read this post. Many people in the world don't even have access to the internet. You are also (probably) in a safe place now. Plenty of people in this world work literally the entire day, or are forced into slavery, prostitution, etc. By being *grateful*, you can now see your bullies had *less* than you and now you see *them* as the victim and can now feel sorry for them. **Now *you* are the one in power**

So the key to ending your misery is to stop perceiving yourself as a victim (because by being a victim you're basically admitting you're powerless) and instead see your bullying as a blessing in disguise because you've now come to see societal beliefs are total BS and by having less social status, you became more free and independent of having to fit into society's BS conformity. Instead of seeing yourself as a victim, see yourself as a **survivor**"

Yes, I was anxious around every bully I had, and there were so, so many. But you were the worst. The list of the tortures you inflicted on me every single day could go on forever. Things I didn't understand then. Sexual harassment. Belittling. Verbal abuse. Telling me to just jump and kill myself as I stood looking out from the balcony of the school we both attended. Little did you know at the time I really was thinking about it. How easy it would've been then to just jump and end the suffering. 

Not that you ever cared, but every single day in that place suffering at yours and dozens of other bully's hands took a tole on me. Everything that was ever done to me, even if you thought it was nothing, was everything. Every act blackened me and chipped away at me bit by bit, until finally I was unrecognisable. This is what your actions did. Broke my heart in two and left me completely shattered inside. No love for myself, no confidence. Worthless. Your actions and the actions of others eventually made me drop out of sixth form. Even though most of you had left, the anxiety and depression that you had nurtured so violently inside of me took hold. You effectively ruined my adolescence. Took what should've been the happiest days of my life away from me. 

So now I want to know,

What gave you the right? To decide who lives and who dies? You played with my life like I was a toy. You nearly killed me.

You will never understand what it's like to hate yourself so much that all you can do is drag a razor across your skin and hope that that night will be your last. 

Even if you ever read this you'll probably just laugh. Just smile and say how stupid or retarded I am. 

It's funny how some people never change. 

I hope you rot.

907,Does anyone else here keep the fact that they were bullied a secret just to avoid people offering sympathies?,4,5jcktm,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/5jcktm/does_anyone_else_here_keep_the_fact_that_they/,5,1482258269.0,"In the past 2-3 years, I've noticed I hate it when people say to me that they're ""sorry to hear I went thru that (bullying)"". I'm not angry with the people who did say that . I've just realised that ever since I experienced a very deep heart break, I suddenly avoid sympathy and pity at all costs.  
  
To me the sympathy and pity comes more out of a place of society saying that you need to express sympathy for people who hardships in their past rather than genuine sympathy and I do all I can to avoid the slightest change of disingenuine sympathy and pity.  
  
Anyone else like me? Not the reason for avoiding sympathy but anyone else avoid it like I do?"
908,My bullying experience.,5,5hokdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/5hokdk/my_bullying_experience/,2,1481462086.0,"Like an alarming amount of people I was bullied throughout my school experience from the tender age of 5 right through to 18 when I left my final year unfinished to escape. I suffered from mental, and physical abuse that only got worse as I got older for the simple reason that the bullies could do it. I know there is a lot of material out there about how the people who do the bullying are frequently victims themselves which may certainly be the case but having done what I can only consider as nothing to deserve such treatment all I can think/feel whenever I see such things is ""Fuck that noise and fuck that guy/girl, you are responsible for your actions and you made a decision to be a dickhole to someone else.""
In my experience bullying is due to the ability to, in the same way as opportunity will make a thief, power over another person will more often than not create a bully. This is an ugly oversimplification of a massive and complex problem but it is how I feel about the whole situation and I am here trying to put my 2 cents worth out.
When I was very little my parents house shared a border with my school, which was a large part of why they choose it so they wouldn't have to take us to school, I would walk across the back field with the school ""bush"" (small collection of trees that made a little on school forest) only to start getting bombed by magpies. I live in NZ and Magpies are these nasty black and white birds about the size of a pigeon and they will fly by over a person super low to terrify them out of their territory. My parents where of course aware of this but seemingly didn't do anything to remove the pest. I would of thought that a guy with a rifle would of removed this pest on a sunday but this never happened. The aftermath of this was that in my 5 year old mind my parents were no longer people I could go to with problems to get them sorted out regardless of wether they actually tried (I have never talked to them about it)
Bullying continued right throughout primary and High School with no interruptions and here is the method I learnt to deal with it. First off is Don't try to stand up to them, this was the first piece of advice I got and tried, surprise surprise fighting back only had me on the receiving end of worse and worse abuse until they had re-established their dominace.
Next was telling teachers about this, teachers are of course completely powerless to do much more than hand out some detention and oh boy can you believe did I get it for getting them into trouble. Both of these so called helpful methods just made things far worse for me. 
What I did which I don't think works but was how I got through school was to simple endure it as a tree bends before a storm. I would put up with whatever thing they dreamed up next and then try to put it out of my mind. My fantasy escape was comics and tv. I'm certainly not advocating this as a plan to deal with your bullying I'm simple relaying what happened to me.
The whole process went like this, first there was the terror of the event, then the shame of it, then the anger (fulled of imagined fantasies of the war crimes against them I would commit if I only but had the chance, yeah its a very unhealthy process) then finally I would distract myself with something else until it happened again. The peace you can experience during that time is quite a pleasent. 
As time went on and I got older and older I got what I believe to be exceptionally tough skin when it came to bullying and the whole terror, shame, anger back to peace got faster and faster. There were even occasions were it would happen and I was so dead inside it would hardly even register. Yeah like i said very unhealthy.
There probably isn't a single part of my makeup that hasn't been coloured by bullying in one form or another. But accepting the situation and just riding it out was a much better way for me to handle it than to hope that some kind of help was coming as we have seen in both fictional and PSA videos. Help wasn't coming and things never got any better. Karma never got back on them for me (infact the last I heard about my bullies was that two of them were doing extraordinarily well for themselves). I never even'd the score or whatever by doing something amazing or awesome. 
Why am I posting this? I don't know, part of it is to get it off my chest, part of it is hoping that someone else will find some glimmer of wisdom that has escaped me and be the better for it. I seriously doubt the later but hope springs eternal.
Thank you for reading through this and if you like me are beign bullied (this happened in school and I am now in my 30's) I do wish only the best for you and hope that things get better.
Stay Strong."

I will never be the same as I was. I will never be able to trust as much as I used to and I sure as hell won't be able to be myself around anyone but my family and I. They've filled my heart with hate and agony but I forgive them for everything they've ever done and for everything they will continue to do.

but there was one school staff, in my grade 10 year, in Plano TX in a school called Shepton. He was an african american who worked in the principals office, I feel like his name was Mr. Lam or Lamb or something close to that.  
  
In the latest series of things I had to go thru, someone at school had found recent delight in punching me hard in my stomach (imagine the incredible hulk punching tony stark without the suit, bit of an exaggeration but actually fairly accurate in the comparison between me and the guy). I was just sucking it up and accepting the treatment. Someone decided I was worthy to stand up for and told Mr. Lam (I never found out who that person was either but it seems in a world of assholes, some people do stand up for the victim). He called me into his office, gradually began discussing the situation and asked me why I hadn't told anyone and I said flat out that I had lost faith in the education system as a support mechanism and in the past when I told teachers, it never ended well""  
  
He just looked me in the eye and told me ""well im different"". I obviously didnt believe the guy and just thought ""another one who thinks he can make a difference"". But this guy actually did, the dude stopped punching me. and then I got into an unpleasant situation with another student and he helped me out there too.  
  
So yea, I would love to get his contact information and send him an email or something thanking him for his service to me as a student but no amount of googling Plano ISD staff information managed to land me his contact information and unless I go back to Texas again and go to some central school database, I am not sure how else I can try and reach him  
  
But I write this post in dedication of teachers who actually do care and do make a difference. You guys are unfortunately rare and the world needs more of you, but the help you give to people like us who gave up on being helped is never forgotten."

DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!! I will repeat. DO NOT DO THIS!!!!!!!! If you tell a teacher or another authority figure that someone is bullying you, then that bully will come after you harder than ever, both physically and verbally. If you are being bullied (unless you have good comebacks) then you unfortunately will just have to put up with it as long as possible. If it gets to the point that this he/she hits you, FIGHT BACK!!!!!!!! I know you might get whipped but you'll gain some respect and the bullying will either stop, or it'll just be more tolerable. If you're getting to the point of self harm and/or suicidal thoughts/attempts. Then start the fight. Again you might get whipped but you'll gain some respect and the bullying will be more tolerable or stop all together.

When I was young, I was bullied... not just picked on, as some dismiss as typical kids... I was 100% bullied..Threatened, beaten, made fun of, and ridiculed in front of classmates (the movie CARRIE style, but without the satanic revenge).   
I grasped the thought of weekends and school days off just to have that feeling of peace and safety... only to return, time and time again to what is etched in my being.  Sure, my parents told the school, the bus driver... but nothing prevented, it only surfaced the embarrassment that came after.  

I know others have similar stories as kids, however; I often find that those times have carried too heavy into adulthood, and have molded me in a persona that only knows how to be picked on.  I laugh it all all the time, as I re-live the ridicule at work as coworkers talk down to me when I'm to assume they're  kidding.  If you ever meet me...I am completely self aware of my stuttering, my fidgeting, oddness in speaking, my introversion.... yet I desire to be a friend. 

I have a backstory on my bully and what became of him, which I can continue at a later date.  Curious of others who have been and how you deal with it in adulthood with having children now... and if you know what happend to your bully/s?"

It may be very painful to bare but hang in there because I promise you it will get better. Back when I was getting bullied by my so called friends I too thought it was the end of the world.

Here is the message I sent ten years ago: 

Hey, I know we have our history dating back to middle school, but I'd like to start over again, fresh, as if I just met you. My past is cluttered, that's for sure, but I'd like to start over with a clean slate in college. I hold no grudges against you or anything --  as a matter of fact, I respect you. You're a very cool-headed person to be around and I have treated you badly in the past. Whether you know it or not you have taught me some very important lessons in life. You've inspired me to be more friendly and outgoing. I'd like for you to add me so we could hang out some time. If you'd ever like to go skydiving or river rafting, I've got some friends who would like to go too, and could probably tell you the best places to go. Consider this my formal amends to you.


And here is his response: 

Hey [Ampyxx],

As I opened this up to write I noticed the message you sent years ago which I don't remember ever seeing and I'm sorry for that. I just wanted you to know that I'm very sorry for how I and some of the other students treating you in school. There's honestly no excuse or reason for it and I can't imagine what you must have dealt with. It took serious strength on your part to put up that and I really respect you for it. I teach high school now and we do a lot to prevent bullying. The other day a student asked me if I had ever bullied someone and I remembered the way we used to act towards you and instantly my heart sank. I am deeply sorry for anything I may have done or said. I also remember how you never backed down and that must have taken a lot of guts. 

I'm sorry I never saw your previous message and I hope this one finds you well. What are you up to these days? I hope things are going well and that you have found a path that makes you happy. 

Again, I truly regret how I treated you and I appreciate your effort to make amends years ago. Hope the offer still stands!"

The first time I can remember actively wanting to die and fixating on the idea I was 8 years old, however I am sure I harbored those same feelings not truly understanding what they were even much younger than that. I was your typical bright eyed kid, who came from two awesome parents who would bend over backwards for me, and came from a home full of love and acceptance. Where I didn't find acceptance was the place as a kid where you are forced to spend most of your day; school. 

I was one of those kids, that just never fit, I learned this early on. While I can't remember specific incidents that young my parents tell me that even everyday from Kindergarten I would come home crying. My parents being the awesome human beings they are did truly try whatever they could to make me fit. It just never took hold and it continued.

Not only was I emotionally tortured by my peers, I was also physically beaten on by them. And because I grew up in the 80's kid's will be kid's and it was considered normal. However ""normal"" for me was a personal and physical hell. 

At 8 years old I don't think I had a grasp of what suicide was, but I did know what death was. Death at that age is told to us as a peaceful place, and that when someone dies they aren't in pain anymore, and that sounded like a dream come true. 

I went to a small elementary school, one of those nice schools where class sizes are small, everyone knows everyone including teachers, parents etc. I learned very early on that the size of my school did not make it a more welcoming space, and I learned very early on that the adults in my school the people who were supposed to educate me were not my allies to stop anything that was happening to me, in fact their tough love, kids will be kids approach, pointing out my downfalls in fact just fueled the fire. They gave my peers all the ammo they needed, both in pointing out my faults, but just by allowing my peers to continue in their treatment towards me, they got more bold, violent, and emotionally damaging. 

Now I will fully admit I was not a tall thin and lanky kid, and I was on the chunky side, I still have a few unwanted pounds. As a little kid it was one thing to be told I was FAT by my peers, it took on a whole new meaning when my gym teacher pointed it out in front of my entire class one day. I was maybe 9 or 10.

By the time I was in grade 4, I had learned not to cry, I had learned to when hit, insulted, screamed at, stuff stolen/broken to just simply look away or down at the floor and nod. I truly believed I was NOTHING, I was FAT, UGLY, STUPID, A TROUBLE MAKER. However in addition to learning how to become stone faced, I learned to smile, and I learned to lie. 

My parents on many occasions did try and talk to other parents, my teachers, etc it just never did any good, often teachers would deem me out to be the trouble maker, or if I was like the other kids this wouldn't happen. Since these things were deemed MY FAULT, and I believed this notion, and realized that my parents made it worse I learned to smile. As soon as I got home, I would be smiling, my parents asked me how school was it would be great. 

As I got in the upper grades, stories, rumors, comments, notes, still being beat up happened both from my peers and kids in upper grades. No social media in those days, but going to a small school might as well have been with how quick things spread.  

However somewhere in that period around grade five or six, I started to not be able to fake it anymore, while I didn't cry, and I didn't fight back, I did become self sabotaging, and to put it bluntly at that very young age I no longer cared. I was horrible to my parents, my brother, my grades were horrible I didn't do homework, didn't care what the consequences ended up being, often would just do nothing in class, I just didn't want anything to do with the place. 

Of course my parents noticed this, and I was dragged to a very nice man to talk to about my feelings and behavior. Again I had mastered the art of smiling, I had mastered the art of diversion, I said I got distracted, that I was tired, that sometimes I had trouble getting it. Anything this nice gentlemen suggested that didn't hit on what was going on was fine with me, cause in my mind adults weren't safe it caused backlash. So the final result was that it was decided that I had ADD. Well that backfired, I got another label, one that they could pump me full of prescriptions for. 

My parents, bless them when I refused medication were nice enough to tell the medical professionals off about it being my decision, as I am sure taking medication I didn't need would have thrown me for a loop. It was during this period, that I penned my very first suicide note, and it was then along with crying every night (which was a nightly occurrence when no one else was around) I began to pray to then god (since I still had a concept of religion at that age) every night that I wouldn't wake up the next day. I cried every morning because I realized it didn't happen.

The cuts, bruises, material items, those things that ended up happening would go away, be replaced or fixed. Emotionally however I was broken, so utterly broken and truly just dejected. I could tell you stories of incidents that happened for days. In 7 and 8 I did gain some distance between me, and the rest of my peers, however I did this by missing out. 

If a school trip was happening, I didn't go. I preferred to stay back at the school by myself in the library and read, or do homework etc. If there was a full day of some activity happening, I would just tell my parents I really didn't want to do it, wasn't interested etc. So again, I could miss it, stay home, hell do homework. These things meant not being alone with them, it meant avoiding instances that couldn't be turned into fuel. It gave me more control. 

Even as a practicing atheist I will tell you that I am ever so thankful that my mother is a Roman Catholic, because upon graduation of this hellish institution everyone is fed into a feeder high school based on their location of their elementary school. I went to a public grade school, but I realized and researched that my mother being a RC meant that I didn't have to continue this hellish experience with my peers, that I could instead go to a Catholic high school in the area. To which my parents agreed. 

So I escaped, and high school was better, I mean there were the cliques and the standard high school stuff, and of course you know by that point I realized I was an atheist so being in a catholic school could be interesting at times, but overall it was okay. I had a small group of friends and I was content with them, I did in that time find a voice, and a backbone, and became this outward human being that I wasn't before. 

So where is the lasting effects? I will tell you. At 28 years old I have very segmented and carefully regulated emotions, in fact at 28 years old I hate to feel, and I will go out of my way to make sure I don't (thankfully I managed to not be an alcoholic or a drug addict). I have a very large, very thick emotionally wall, and I trust no one at face value, cynical like you wouldn't believe. I always have that nagging voice in the back of my head of "" you know what they really think about you, don't you?"" And most of all standard coping methods don't work for me. I've come up with my own. 

At 28 for the most part I am pretty happy go lucky, and I have to the best of my ability faced those demons, however I learned that therapy despite trying multiple times didn't work, I have a hard time talking to someone who is suppose to be in a ""safe environment"". To me that term proved to be bullshit at a very young age. Because of my experiences I choose to remain childless. I don't want to risk any of my offspring experiencing what I did. 

However there is a silver lining, and that was that I survived, and somehow depression beyond those years was never an issue. I am happy in a relationship, went to college, have a great paying job. I mean I am not perfect, I still have things I can work on, but can't we all. 

I do often wonder how it is that I survived, because if all that stuff had happened now instead of then, I don't think I would survive. Grades K to 8 almost feels like it didn't happen to me, I have detached myself from my childhood totally, and in a lot of ways during that time period I never got the typical childhood experience I learned what I know no to be more adult emotions and experiences very quickly. 

Someday's when things hit the fan, and things suck at work, or I get mad and pissed off over some trivial thing, and lose it. I sometimes think of little 6,7,8,9 etc year old me and how the hell I just managed to hold it all together, to keep smiling because some days I sure as hell can't do it as an adult. Despite, the pain of then, the memories, the left over scars, the after effects, if you told me you could go back in time and change it all, I would truly say no. 

That 8 year old little girl, who woke up everyday wanting to die, who endured all that she did, she never gave up. That little girl, despite growing up never really left, she instead became that little voice inside, my personal cheerleader, my driving force, the one that when I fall screams in my head to get up, and I am forever grateful for her. 

Thanks for listening, and I apologize again for the length.

I started out thinking everyone was perfect. Every single boy and girl. Every single janitor and teacher. I was probably the most optimistic kid there. Making friends was easy, but you don't always make the right friends, even in kindergarten.
  
 I made a friend named Erika. She seemed really nice and I guess she was at the time. Her father was abusive and her mother didn't do anything about it. I never realized he was, he acted different when I was there. He was just the guy on the couch watching the TV when I came to play.
 
 One time when I came over, however, she wanted to show me her hamster. We took it out of its cage and brought it into the living room. Her dad was sitting on the floor watching TV, but she accidentally dropped the hamster on his stomach. The worst thing was he wasn't wearing a shirt. He got so angry and started chasing her around the house. I ran into the middle of the hallway he was about to run into and stopped him straight in his tracks. I yelled at him, "" Don't hurt my best friend, leave her alone!"" and he walked away. Nothing happened, he just went back to watching TV. She didn't even get in trouble that day. The irony is she had been hurting me everyday at school, but I still stood up for her when she needed me. I was only seven years old and I had no idea what a bully was.
  
I was her best friend until grade five. During those years she would be my friend in class and out of school. It was only lunch time at school, or break, when she would bully me. There were the occasional moments in class, but I remember crying everyday. I would go sit on a brick behind the kindergarten shack. Everyday I would go up to her and ask her if I could play with her and all our other friends and she would say no. She shoved me out of the way and all the girls would laugh. 
 
 One lunch she let me played with them and the other girls. She told me we were playing tag with the boys. She told me to go try and catch them and that I was it. The truth was the boys weren't playing... They thought I was crazy. I was so embarrassed when I realized they weren't playing. They were all laughing at me and saying things like, ""What is wrong with her"" and "" now we know who the crazy is"" and I ran away. I ran to the end of the school field and hid behind a big oak tree. I was only six years old. I never knew how to talk to boys after that.

  Wrapping this story up, I have always had to deal with people bullying me. The difference is I thought it was normal. I didn't know or understand it was bullying. I just knew I felt sad and I knew my best friend was happy. The only time I said I didn't want to be her friend, she cried and told the teacher. I got in a lot of trouble, but it made me think she really did want to be my friend. So I never gave up on her again. Even after all the hurtful words, glares and pushes she gave me, I knew she was my best friend. 

  I haven't talked to her since grade five, but I have major insecurities now. I know what bullying is and I don't like it, but even to this day I let people bully me around. Especially my **best friend**.

938,Bully,4,1d40w3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/1d40w3/bully/,1,1366955228.0,"Hey guys,

Hi. My name is Austin and I make YouTube videos [HERE] (http://www.youtube.com/user/thenivenulls) It's nice to virtually meet you. :)

Last night my wife and I watched the documentary Bully. It absolutely broke my heart to hear the stories of these kids and, in some cases, see the abuse first hand. As a father, it pissed me off that my daughter may have to be subject to this kind of behavior. As an adult, it pissed me off that there is seemingly no real change taking place in these schools by the teachers and staff. And as a human, it reminded me that we're all broken individuals and sometimes that brokenness overshadows the goodness of so many people.

Now I could go on to write paragraph after paragraph about how we need some real change in schools, how parents of bullies need to be held responsible for the actions of their kids even if it means their child is kicked out of school after more than one accusation/instance of bullying, how kids need to band together and confront bullying (which I wholeheartedly agree with and think that it would fundamentally change the landscape of schools across the world, by the way), and so on and so forth.

However, that's not what I want to write about. I want to write about how you, the victim of bullying and degradation, are loved and cooler than you even understand. I know it sounds cliche but it's true. Let me explain more:

* Everyone has something they're good at and that includes YOU. Maybe you're not a jock or some rock musician (which is not the coolest thing in life despite what society tells you) but you have something that you're good at and that makes you valuable. Maybe it's graphic design, web development, being a good listener, making people laugh, etc. It doesn't matter what it is (or how ""big"" or ""small"" you think it is). It makes you valuable and you affect other people's lives in a positive way by being good at whatever it is you're good at.

* Most bullies are more insecure than you but they act out in a different way than you or I would. They have problems at home or had a rough upbringing and don't feel loved so they take their anger and frustration and look to destroy the happiness of a ""nerd"" or someone who's not as ""cool"" as them. What this means for YOU is that you should understand that although they may do terrible things to you, you are so much cooler than them. We all have bad things that happen to us in life but only the strongest are able to deal with it in a healthy way while the weak ones act out in a negative way. Embrace that strong and awesome part about yourself and remember it when someone calls you a terrible name so you can laugh at them knowing that you are so much stronger than them.

* Lastly, everyone has the right to be cool. It's not just for the good looking or the successful (although I'd argue success and good lucks are both relative so screw what society tells you anyways). I've met tons of people and because of my preconceived thoughts just from looking at them, and what society has told me they will be like because they look a certain way, I assume that they're not cool or will be kind of awkward. I'll admit those thoughts have entered my head before. However, I engage those people because I don't want to let my thoughts be the determining factor of what my idea of this person ultimately is. I can't tell you how many people immediately erase any of those negative thoughts I had because they are confident and understand that they are cool because they embrace who they are to their core. Believe that what you say matters, embrace the way God made you and engage with people in a way that erases preconceived notions of each other and, instead, simply relate to them as one human to another.

The bottom line is this: NEVER allow someone to determine what you can or can't do, who you are or how you should feel. That may be easier said than done but everyone has that ability. Unfortunately, some of you may come from broken homes and maybe your parents don't show you the love that you so desperately need and long for. I feel like this is an unfortunate reality for many kids who are bullied. They go to school, work, etc. and experience terrible things just to come home and have dead beat parents who don't care about them or encourage them and that breaks my heart. (Side note: If you find yourself in a terrible situation like this feel free to reach out me via Twitter. I want to be your friend more than ever.)

I want to also address YouTube and the fact that bullying does take place online and is prevalent on YouTube. I get hate comments every day about being too skinny, having a dead tooth (yeah, I tripped and fell when I was little and now one of my teeth is dead and really yellow. I go hard. #ThugLife), being in an interracial marriage, having a baby that is worthless because it is half black or half white, being accused of being gay (that one always makes me laugh the most), being a terrible parent for having my child online, being a terrible husband because I should ""do more"" for my wife (whatever that means since they see an average of 1 hour of our total day per video), and so many other things, many of which I wouldn't even post here because they're so vulgar. And these are only the ones that relate to me. Add these and more that are directed towards my wife. It's out of control and if you've experienced issues of online bullying REPORT these channels to the respective sites to have them banned.

The the thing is, though, I don't care what people say about me. I understand that these people are hurting and have so many problems so they pick someone they're either jealous of or even do actually believe some of the things they're saying but I could care less. I'm secure with who I am and I find my worth through the love of Jesus Christ and the many blessings and gifts he's blessed me with. However, that doesn't make these terrible comments ok and it doesn't mean everyone of you have found that level of security within yourself yet. 

So what is the point of writing all of this? Will it inspire you or comfort you if you've been bullied? Will it encourage all of you, bullied or not, to band together and build a ballin outrageous community of awesome people in your schools, neighborhoods and workplace? Will this be read by just one person and get buried amidst the endless amount of tweets, Facebook posts, etc.? I don't know. But if only one person can read this and be affected in a positive way then I'd be happy.

My heart goes out to you if you've been bullied. I truly believe in you, support you and love you and we've never even met. Feel free to tweet me [@thenivenulls] (https://twitter.com/thenivenulls) on Twitter. I'd love to hear your thoughts on all of this, your story of being bullied or just have you reach out and make a new friend. 

If you know someone who's been affected by bullying please share this with them and share this on Twitter and Facebook in hopes of reaching people who may need to be encouraged and you never knew it. Stay strong, love each other and remember that you are a valuable human being no matter what anyone says.

-Austin"

Some of the names: Fat, Nerd, geek, pale, ugly and many more!
The problem is, it's gone too far.
I actually look at myself in the mirror and feel sad.

I have told him to stop, even tried using comebacks.

They justify it, or say ""he's crazy"", and basically resorting to the police is impossible because it's their word against mine and they lie or twist the story so I am the bully.

I'll give a small background. I'm a middle eastern american male, Christian who went to majority white school while 9/11 was happening. The first couple of days after that was pretty much all the staring the friends that I once had stayed distant I literally had only a group of 4 people to begin with. It was already rough since I moved at the end of 8th grade so I pretty much lost all my friends going into highschool so what little friends I did make were gone. So the verbal abuse started, Terrorist, sand n word, Osama lover, Muslim pos, anything you can think of I heard and I was actually scared for my life. I know all of you have been there waking up and thinking why am I even going to school wtf should I do, what can I do. I was f***ing scared to go to school something I enjoyed doing. Both my parents worked so I had to walk back and fourth to school and everyday I would have to walk 20-30 minutes after school so I could feel safe but I did what I had to do.Lunch time I would hang out with one of my middle eastern teachers so I could just have some peace for 30 minutes. For about 1-2 months it got to me, I hated my life, hated everything and everyone and I'm not sure what triggered it but the next day I had the I don't give a f*** attitude and for me it got better. I walked to school and didn't listen to anyone didn't care about anything they had to say it  didn't stop them from shoving me or calling me names but it just didn't get to me. I told myself they throw a punch I'll throw a punch ( which was a horrible mentality since I didn't hit my growth spurt till 10th grade.) But I was determined not to let it get to me. They would call me names I'd reply ""yup that's me"" would get in my face and I would say ""watch out I'm Arab"" my thought process was well if they can say this to me I can the same thing they say right back to them. I know now it wasn't right but back then I was just looking at not getting my ass kicked and was thinking of anything that could help. Eventually the name calling stopped and people didn't bug me anymore. Now yes I know I would consider myself lucky that it wasn't any worse but my freshman year in a new school horrible, I was excited starting something new highschool was suppose to be those years you remember forever and going into that first year I thought different. I thought it was going to be a hell I had to deal with for 4 years.
After my first year it got better. I got bigger,played football,made new friend ( still didn't have many) and ignoring the haters became easier. But I always knew that people were talking sh** behind my back but I just didn't let it get to me. 
Thinking back I wish I did say something, I wish I did talk to a counselor,I wish I did tell my parents but I thought well what are they going to do about it? What would get done? Or that they would just embarrass me and things would get worse.
Yet I knew I had to talk to someone but never did.
I just want to let everyone know that it does get better,keep your head up,and talk to someone. That's the one main thing I regret if I would've just talked to someone I think everything would've been better, if I would said something to someone else that was getting bullied I might have been able to mentally get through it a little better. 
If anyone needs someone to talk to please feel free to message me. Stay safe

Sorry about the Grammer mistakes just had alot to say."

It’s not severe, but it’s still something that really bothers me...
My school is majority African American, maybe 60%? Most people were so kind to me! I’m a very timid person, as I’ve dealt with a lot growing up. I don’t really want to get into it, but one day I was sitting down waiting to be picked up, and the only two people left were a girl and boy, both African American. I was sitting down waiting, with earbuds in but they weren’t on. I began to hear her say things about me, such as she didn’t want to get near me because white people are filthy, and they all have bed bugs. That I’m an ugly white girl, so on. Again, I’ve never talked to this girl in my life. We were quite opposite. I am tall, and fairly thin while, ah, she was not. The boy had a twisted look on his face, and he said that was racist. But she said clear as day “I’m black, I can’t be racist” the boy told her that I could probably hear her, since I looked up at them. He told her that was not okay to say, and that anyone can be racist. 

I didn’t want to go into full detail, but that’s the gist. She said some other hurtful things about me and assuming about my home life (which is not the best. By no means am I rich) 

Am I alone? Has anyone else ever been made fun of for their skin?"

I have mental health issues, depression & anxiety not to mention being extremely shy. I didn't want to be a cashier but decided that it was time to get out of my shell and improve myself (started to not bite my nails). 

I started working in December 2019 around christmas time, everything was great during that month, the pay was good and was told that everyone was getting a raise soon. I was happy to come to work and everyone was nice to me. 

Until January of this year.

I take zoloft for my depression and my parents get my medicine for me since I cant drive yet. Well they sometimes hold my medicine from me and one of these days was a work day, I had run out of medicine and had gotten no word from my parents so I thought I would be fine for that one day. Nope it was horrible. I was nauseous, dizzy, headaches for hours and I wasn't thinking straight. On that day, a former high school classmate who is a coworker came to me to chat about how I was doing since I last saw her. I didn't think before I burted out that I moved out of my abusive parent's house, that my sister was a criminal and I reported her to the police, that my mother in law was being passive aggressive towards me and that my depression was on a all time high. I said this to her and in front of my other coworkers who were nearby, she was in shock and replied that she was sorry about that and left.

Since that day I have been ignored by all of my coworkers, at first they wouldn't talk to me. Then they wouldn't come to help bag if a customer had a big order. Then they would leave their registers to be on their phones and talk to each other to then leave me the only register open during a busy hour. Then my managers become assholes to me. 

I have 4 main managers I'll call them the Heathers (not their real names) and one head manager who is male. I'll explain what each Heather does to me and have the main manager for last.
1. The Yellow Heather does like me and was the one to hire me but when I ask a important question like when I was sick, I asked when does she want me to come in, she wouldn't respond to my texts and just leave them on read. But when I asked where do I get my paysubs, she automatically responded. I do like her but she can be ignorant when she needs to do important things and doesn't tell anyone about any important things.


2. The Blue Heather just ignores me or gets annoyed when I ask for help. She sighs in enjoyment when I ask for a override or stares at me when I have 5 customers that have big orders and I need help bagging. She will only come over to bag if it benefits her AKA if she knew the customer and chat them up. She would also tell me to ask someone else for help ex. When I asked where the trash bags were, she told me to ask someone else. And singles me out ex. I had my bag next to me, not opened. She came and told me that it wasn't allowed to be next to me. So I put my bag in the office that's never locked, door is always open to see that one of my coworkers has her stuff next to her and isn't called out for it.


3. The Green Heather gets mad at me the most for the things that are not in my control. She groans when I ask for a override or when I need help. She would yell at me to hurry up and other things when I'm trying to do something else ex. trying to apply a day off for my jury duty (told to do that by Blue Heather) to be yelled that someone is at my register, went back to finish my application to be yelled yet again that someone is at my register again. Then get told that I just need to bring in the paper and that would be it while Blue Heather was smiling at that. Or another ex. On the eve of Valentines day, I got off at 3 and when to go look at candies but was yelled by Green Heather told what was I doing and need to wait for my replacement which I was never told that I had to wait for a replacement, was told to go home when I tried to go back to my register and yelled at when I wasn't clocked in because I wasn't scheduled to be there in the beginning.


4. Red Heather is the worst manager to ever exist. All she does is flirt with older men and talk to coworkers. She gets mad or annoyed when I ask for help, she tells me to stay still and to hurry up whatever I'm doing. Ex. I was never told that I needed to tell a manager that I was going to the bathroom, I told the former high school classmate that I was making a quick bathroom break. Not even in the bathroom, about to touch the door, I was called to my register. I quickly used the bathroom, came back to my register and was told to never go anywhere without telling her. When I can never find her cause shes busy talking to every older man she sees. Another ex. Yet again never told about a rule of not allowed to have my wallet near my register. I had just bought a drink and went to count my money in my wallet on the belt. Red Heather came over and told me to stop playing with my money and that the cameras are seeing that I'm stealing money from my register and to put my wallet in the office. 

The head manager is a dude that doesn't tell anyone anything like Yellow Heather on anything important. Yesterday I had a doctors appointment at 3, I get off at 3 so I asked Yellow Heather and the head manager DAYS before my appointment if I could leave 5 minutes early, was told yes. Yesterday asked the head manager do I need to bring in a excuse, was told no. Around 2:55, just got done ringing up my mother in law, was right behind her, getting my things, had told the head manager bye and was about to clock out. The manager on the floor (not a heather) came to me had we had this conversation.
M:Where are you going?
Me:I have a doctors appointment today and I need to leave 5 minutes early since it's at 3
M:No you aren't, who approved this?
Me:Yellow Heather and Head Manager.
Head manager comes out of the office.
HM:I told her she could leave.
M:well we only have one cashier open.
HM:EXCUSE ME?
M:well the other cashier just went on break and (me)'s replacement doesnt get here till 3:05 like usual. 
I'm standing in shock and terrifed by the atmosphere, I don't like arguements and I was already scheduled to leave at 3. I couldn't reschedule my appointment cause it would cost $100.
HM: Well what are you going in to the doctors for?
I just clocked out and left as soon as she said that, I got in my mother in law's car and took off the store's shirt. I was angry that they were about to make me hold back to my doctors appointment and ask what I was going in for. I was finally happy that I had a day off today to be away from the snow and those coworkers who have made my depression worst. 

My mind has gone back to where I was as a kid, I had been bullied from kindergarten to 7th grade. I promised myself I wouldn't feel this way, that I wouldn't be suicidal anymore and that I wouldn't put another shoelace to my neck and hang myself. 

But unlike back then when I had no one, I have my boyfriend who has been supportive of me and cheers me up when I come home from that toxic environment. I'm grateful for him but I dont know what to do about my workplace. I can't report to the head manager cause he's friends with Red Heather and she flirts with him.

I told my parents about my workplace and they said that when they were at Ingles, they talked about me and they responded with 'oh she's working there? We would love to have her here!'
I haven't gotten any news about that and I hope that I get news soon. I'm asking for advice on how to deal with my workplace and the coworkers. 

I'm gonna go to bed soon since I have work tomorrow at 9 in the morning. 
I hope you guys have a great day."

So I was in my S.T.E.A.M. class ( Science, technology, engineering, art, math) at school where there was this kid (lets call him Ryan) that was making fun of me, and calling me ugly and fat. I was sitting by him at the end of a table. He made fun of me all the time in class, and on this particular day I was in a bad mood. I got fed up with it and pushed him out of his seat, in turn he punched me in the area between my nose and my eye. I got a bloody nose and a faint black eye.

Side note: this was my first ""fight"" in school.

The teacher takes me outside and asks me what happened and then asks him the same, I was sent to clean up my face and then she lectured me about violence is never the answer and stuff. Then a few minuets later we were called to the assistant principles office. He asks me what happened so I told him, then he asked me what I wanted to do, I said go home, I can't remember if I went home or not though. He apologized and whatnot, I apologized to but with a look on my face that said *not sorry*.I didn't get in trouble at all

Edit: Violence should be the last option *always*."

Theyre a lot of stories of threats and abuse over such a short period of time. Annoyingly for you reading i dont want to go into too much detail.
   Tonight was last straw and I flipped out at him after he done something humiliating towards me in public. He later came down to talk to me about it and enabled me to explain how i would have to report him if he doesnt stop. He apologised and said its just his humour.

Heres my problem. I need to be able to record what happened for future use. I would like to obtain the cctv footage of his act without officially reporting him. And maybe tell someone in confidence whats happening so if it happens again i have a record to go back on.

Any advise?"

958,My Ex-friend is harassing me. What should I do?,4,dwma4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/dwma4a/my_exfriend_is_harassing_me_what_should_i_do/,0,1573825106.0,"So, I’m 16/M. I had this female friend, 16/F, whom I’ve known for about 7 years. We bonded in 4th grade by playing video games online together. Anyway, for the past month she has been giving me issues. Firstly, she cut me out for no apparent reason. She texted me out of the blue saying that I was toxic and creepy, told me to grow up, and that I was too much. I thought this was really odd since we were so close and best friends. It broke me, and because of that, I vented to some mutual friends. These mutual friends weren’t trustworthy, and ended up telling my friend, who I will refer to as R from here on, the stuff I said about her. I did say some pretty horrible, but true, stuff out of anger, none of which I meant at the time, which I won’t get into stating for privacy reasons. R then posted a post on Instagram, telling everyone that she found out about what I had said, and an image of a picture she had in her room of me, which she burned, and took pictures of it as it did. I suffer from depression and this year had been very rough for me, and she knew that. My dog died, my stepdad left, and now my best friend cut me out. All of these caused me to start having thoughts of suicide and self harm. I talked to my counsellor, who took me to the hospital, where I had to stay for three days. Fast forward a few weeks after I got out of the hospital. R contacts me to “stop posting about her on facebook” which I had been doing since I missed her. She then told me she was going to give me a second chance. I stupidly accepted. Bad choice. My negative thoughts about R still hadn’t left my head, so I stupidly vented to the same friends, who told R again! R messages me a few days later threatening that “if I say anything about (her) again, (I’ll) be sorry.” I literally said the things I did out of anger, and never meant to actually hurt her. Anyway, the next day, I go to school, all is fine, until R arrives. She’s never usually there in the morning since she has a class that she takes at a workplace in my town, so I found this to be extremely odd. I was hanging out with a friend, who dislikes R and vice versa, and R comes up to us, and starts talking to my friend, who I’ll call K. They start having a casual conversation. After what felt life forever, R leaves, and K and I set off to find the school counsellor so I could let her know about this. She wasn’t at the school that day. There is another teacher who is also trained at my school, who I will call AC (her initials). So K and I went upstairs to AC’s class. On the way there, we ran into R, who was at her locker, which is on the way to AC’s class. So as she’s chatting with a bunch of her friends she coughs and under her breath says, “a**hole”... twice, then acts as if nothing happened. I ignore her, and finally get to AC’s class, only to find out AC is not in her classroom either! So K and I go to the office, where I talk to the vice principal about what is going on. He calmly explained that they could isolate me and keep me in a quiet area of the office meant for students to do work. I agreed to that. My first period teacher, who I will call KK (her initials), came to the class and gave me some work. My first period is in the library and I had a project that needed to be submitted that was on a computer in there. KK asked me if I wanted to submit it “now, or later”. I told her I would do it then and there. I followed her back to the library. Just as I was exiting the office, AC was talking to the secretary. I asked AC if I could talk, and KK asked if “after I was done talking, if I wanted to go submit my project”. I told her “sure.” She went back into the library, and I went into a meeting room with AC, where I chatted with her about the stuff going on, and I needed to speak to a guidance counsellor, as I was planning to go to a city about 2 hours away to stay with my aunt, uncle, and little cousin, if this situation doesn’t get better. AC comes with me to speak to the guidance counsellor, who says she will contact the high school in the city to see if we could work something out. I agreed, and thanked her. After I left the guidance counsellor, I was put back into the work area where I was previously. A few hours pass and now it’s lunch. I feel uncomfortable about the entire situation, and leave the school for the day. Hours later, I was talking to an old friend, who I will call IB, who was also bullied by R before. I asked her if she did the same things as she is doing to me to her, and she said no. This was weird. So I asked her if R does says anything to me, if I should yell at R and make everyone aware of the situation. IB, who is unbeknownst to me friends with R again, texts that to R, and R threatens me again, stating that if I were to do that, she would punch me and it wouldn’t be her fault. Now, R is quite muscular, and I am a scrawny nerdy guy, so I was quite nervous upon seeing the message. R also threatened to have her friends go after me, who I’m not afraid of since they are really snobby girls. I was about to block IB, but before I do, I get one more message from R, that IB copied and pasted, stating a bunch of stuff I never said to her. Stuff such as “(I) threatened to break into (R’s) house and rob it, that I would hit her (when in fact R would hit me) and that she has PTSD because of me, and much more. I block IB and don’t contact her anymore. At the end of the day, a mutual friend, who I’ll call M, of R and I texts me and tells me that I called M fake, and said a bunch of other nasty stuff about M. I never said anything about M, or anyone else for that matter. I told her about the situation. M apologizes and supports me by telling me I can come to M if I need help. I thank her for her support. 

My parents know about this, so does the principal, my aunt and uncle who I’m going to stay with, my grandparents, my counsellors, and a few trustworthy friends. I am not sure what to do at this point and I need advice ASAP before R ends up getting physical with me. I am probably not going to go to school tomorrow, as I feel unsafe due to the situation. Thanks in advance for any tips you can give me."

I was involved in an abusive relationship with my ex as the bully and he showed narcissistic behavior. One of the earlier signs is that he lied and fabricated his life stories. He didn't like my activities and said they were idiotic, so I decided to quit them and tried to do his own activities, but they were never fun. All it was sitting in front of the TV and watched movies or play videos, especially on sunny days. He would belittle me for suggesting another activity like going out for a walk. 

As time went by, his behavior made him unbearable to be around. The sex was no longer fun. It felt invasive and wrong, with all these warning bells ringing inside my head. He would call at almost all hours of the night saying he needed my support after a fight with his parents or a bad day at work. Whenever I choose not to answer his texts or calls, he would accuse me of being unfaithful and would never believe me when I said I needed breathing room. Whenever I was around him, out of nowhere he wanted to pick a fight with me, with me getting blamed for starting it. 

I knew he was a bully, but I didn't want to leave because I thought I loved him. Well, both my sister and my best friend called up one night to say that I should leave him. He had contacted them and called me all sorts of names while talking to them. Both of them were disgusted and cut off all contact with him. It took me a bit of time to realize that he'll never change his behavior as narcs usually never seek help for their behavior. So, I told him that we were finished. 

After some time, I felt a lot better without him. No bully by my side. 

For those in a relationship with a bully, you're not alone in this. If you feel that he/she is bullying you, leave them! No one deserves to be bullied while in a relationship. A relationship is about a connection between two people who love each other and desire to explore their interests. A bully usually likes to be the one making the shots and they like to criticize you and your interests. All the best!"

Then when other people are around she’s been super nice to me. 

I confided in a friend who said I shouldn’t say anything as that’s just the way this girl is and it will just make everyone else awkward. So I didn’t. 

A couple of weeks ago, I went away and they had a dinner party without me where they organized our yearly Labour day weekend holiday (I’m from NZ so it’s in late October). Apparently this girl put her foot down and said that I can’t come because I’ll ruin the whole trip and she just can’t stand being around me. 

So when I met up with my other friend she told me they’d decided to go without me but they all feel really bad and it’s not their fault she didn’t want me there, and she kept saying at least we had the decency to tell you.

My brother 14 is being cyberbullied by another boy who isn't even from his city. That guy is apparently a friend of someone in his class and thus now there are 5 bully-supporters in his class who apparently even have a messenger group where they share MEMES they create from my brothers pictures.
As a big brother I want to intervene. Since I can't track that kid down, I suggested my brother to avoid sharing too many pics online and block everyone who are connected with that boy/might be supporters of bullying, with a hope that they will eventually get tired and stop doing that. I am really worried that my bro is quite fragile physiologically and he might not be able to simply ignore it... any suggestions would be very much appreciated!"

Called my attention a lot of times. He made everytime his examples during class, like you should have patience class because patience is confidence, mark do you have patience? 

Everytime, he's like invading my personal space everytime. I said to myself. May be he's just that picking on me because im small or whatevs. But later on, he scolded me on not saying TY whenever i ask my classmates to lend me a paper in front of my class. That was the last straw.

So after the class. I talk to him one to one, student to teacher. I asked on why he bullying me so much. He said bullying, bullying ?!. Id never bullied you mark, i may call your attention but that is not bullying. That is my way of connecting/bonding to you to my students. I want to bond with you, to make you have friends. You wanna know why, because people hate you mark, but dont show it to you. I prevented them from doing so. The first time you'd make a impression in the gc. Is the first time your classmates want to bully you. Your actions, your attitude, personality is bad. tyou wont keep a job easily, because of that. Even a call center job you cant even keep because your quick to agrression. You know people want to help you but you perceive them as a threat. You push people away because of your attitude. I admitted to him that i was a bullying addict from elem, high school, and college. But again he said, mark to tell you the truth, you must adjust to the community not the other way around. You cant expect the people are getting near you, you must get near to them.

Why do you think i called your attention when i want to put you on the tour, to connect to people that why. But again you percieve it as a threat.
You should close yourself in because your the victim, try not to be.. you should be open minded mark

I said, okay sir, ill try to think what you said.
I went outside the classroom and try to not to cry,  i pinch myself so hard, so the others don't see myself as crying. I realized that i was an asshole to them, and ive been living out a lie. I thought that everything was going my way because people accepted me. 

I said to myself, maybe you should let people in. Be open minded. But arguements sprung out of my mind, saying you cant do that. You want to be a punching bag for the rest of your life? 

Honesty I want to be the guy whose social life is okay or the best. I envy those guys who had that. I want to know how to do that, but i dont know where to start. I dont have PR 

So guys what do you think?"

Idk, i often thought in my adult years bullies are the enforcers of the norm. If your not accepting the norm, you will get persecuted or something like that. 

The lies that people spat, when being bullied is to tell an adult... BULLSHIT. I tried that in elementary and highschool. And it didnt work, it just make you more of a target. 

My solution is to blend in your surroundings. Befriend the popular guy in school or make friends so much that they will defend you. The other way is to fight the bully, sure it will be hard but worth it. Bullies respect strength, if you beat them up, the bullies should leave you alone"

I was friends with some people last year and over the summer I stayed at one of the girls houses for a few days at a time. I realized she abuses and hoards animals. I tried confronting her about it, and the whole group is set against me gaslighting me really hard. Here’s the thing idgaf about those girls or being alone. I just want to help those animals. I’ve been walking the dog because no one else will. Her other dog is super allergic to fabreeze and she refuses to take it out of the house, the poor thing can’t sit still and is covered in red hives. She has 2 cats and 4 reptiles and her house is a fucking hoarders nest. I’m just surprised none of the people I thought were on my side backed me up. 
       They broke me at least 2 times now. When I tried to confront her that day she invited all her friends to my house and they all came and surrounded me and scolded me until I started crying and freaked out. They lied to my face saying that they walk the dog and they don’t need water or food all day. And that I don’t know anything about dogs. 
    Yesterday she brought her dog to class. He loves me more than her because I walk him every day (still not enough I will be reporting) she acted like he’s the most loved dog and doesn’t spend all day in a small cramped kennel without water and sometimes no bed. Because he has accidents when he’s not able to hold it in for 14 hours at a time. This girl is a fuckig monster. During class we were sitting in a lecture hall (dogs are allowed at my school) she let everyone pet him but as soon as he got to me she would yank him back. No one saw because it was under the theater chairs, but they broke me again. I felt like I couldn’t help him. At the end of class he ran up to me and pressed his head on my legs :( . My main fear is even if I report her nothing will happen, like it does with so many animal abusers. And they they won’t have any more chances I just want to do it right and try to get them out. 

 The one girl who was on my “side”told the mean girl that I was concerned about her animals before I even got a chance to confront her. This is the same girl who would be really upset and agree with me about most of the animal abuse issues I brought up. And I only told her because I thought we could work together to help the mean girl. I just wanted to help I didn’t want her to get in trouble, but fuck her. There’s nothing else I can do.  Because if I distance myself I know the dog gets punished, I can’t avoid them or their passive aggressive abuse. I’m reporting her today. But if she doesn’t get in trouble for what she’s doing, there will be no more hope for them :("

992,My bullying story (from c. 20 years ago),3,czjzt7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullying/comments/czjzt7/my_bullying_story_from_c_20_years_ago/,4,1567627849.0," I just posted this in an 'askreddit' thread asking about when your friends turned out not to be your friends. I had never written it down before and only around 5 people in my life know this story. It was cathartic to write it so I decided to repost here.

When I was in the penultimate year of secondary school (high school to some of you) - aged c. 16/17. This was an all boys' private school and we are talking the late 1990s so you can imagine that every joke and every insult centred around so-and-so being ""gay"".

We had a geography field trip to some place out in the countryside (UK) and were staying in groups of 4-5 guys in dorm-type rooms.

I was pretty painfully shy back then and quiet, did well at school, so an obvious target for the mutiple bullies.

Came down for breakfast one morning and one of the 'popular' rugby team scumbags decided it would be funny to create a rumour out of nothing that they had walked in on me blowing another guy in my room.

Of course it wasn't true, I was 100% straight at the time and to this day (I'm married with 4 kids), the guy they said I did this with was someone I had never even really spoken to in my year at school.

Well anyway, because of my social awkwardness at the time and inability to handle myself properly, I didn't just laugh it off but defensively denied it and the one-time rumour grew and grew. Soon everyone was talking about it and once the trip was over my time at school became a constant battle with this one ridiculous made up story. At every school event it was brought up, someone would joke about it/ ask me if we were still together .etc .etc

Anyway.  I had a circle of 5-6 very close friends at school. Really good, solid guys that weren't shallow idiots and had each other's backs. They had never joined in with all the taunting and rumours - I mean, why would they? They were my good friends.

So it was several months after the field trip and we were getting changed after PE (I think you call it gym class?) and suddenly out the blue they all ask me if the rumours were really true in the end and I was actually with this other guy. I was devastated - not at the suggestion that I was gay (would have had no issue with that) but at the realisation that ultimately they were willing to believe the scumbag bully-driven groupthink over their own friend.

Whilst the whole episode that lasted well over a year before it blew over destroyed my confidence for a long time, it was the betrayal of these ""friends"" that tore me up.

Luckily the story turned out well as a year or so later I left that school, went to a great uni, made totally new friends, got married and have 4 wonderful kids. Sorry this was way longer than I intended..."

I went into college and guess what they followed me, they ruined my chances. I dunno if god was testing me or iam a joke to the whole universe or something curse me at birth to be this.

They bullied me not because im ugly but because of my social awkwardness. Now i transfered colleges and sigh of relief there was no people who knew me... i am a cleanslate for 14 years.
